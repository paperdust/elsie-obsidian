# Chapter 9

The symbol was crude.

That was Cornelius's first coherent thought after the initial shock of discovery faded. He stood before the wall, wings slightly spread for balance, and catalogued the image with clinical precision. A perfect circle—well, nearly perfect, with a slight wobble on the eastern quadrant that suggested hasty execution. Within it, a vertical-slit eye rendered in thick strokes. Around the perimeter, the Latin text in what appeared to be the same dark liquid as the eye itself.

Not ink, he realized as his enhanced vision focused on the substance. Wine. Red wine, already beginning to dry at the edges where it had been painted thinnest.

"Touch nothing," Melas ordered, though the command was directed more at the terrified catering worker than at Cornelius. The captain moved closer, his weathered face illuminated by the lamp he had retrieved from a wall sconce. "How long does wine take to dry on stone?"

"That would depend on ambient humidity, air circulation, and the wine's sugar content." Cornelius tilted his head, analyzing the symbol from a different angle. "Given the conditions in this corridor—relatively still air, moderate temperature—between fifteen and forty minutes for surface drying. Complete desiccation would require several hours."

"So this was drawn recently. Within the lockdown window."

"Almost certainly." Cornelius stepped back, mentally measuring the symbol's placement. Approximately five feet from the floor—the height of an average human's reach without stretching. The strokes were confident despite their artistic deficiency, suggesting someone who knew exactly what they intended to draw before they began.

Imelda had moved to examine the text more closely, her ancient eyes tracking the Latin letters with practiced ease. "The calligraphy is poor. Someone with classical education would have formed these characters more precisely."

"Unless they were deliberately obscuring their training," Melas suggested.

"Possible. But unnecessary if one is already concealing identity through secrecy." Imelda straightened, brushing invisible dust from her robes. "This reads like amateur theatrics rather than genuine scholarship."

Cornelius felt something shift in his mind—not quite recognition, but the sense that disparate pieces were beginning to align into coherent pattern. He turned away from the symbol, his tail sweeping in thoughtful arcs as he processed.

"Captain Melas," he said slowly. "Does this symbol not strike you as remarkably convenient?"

The captain's eyebrows raised. "In what sense?"

"In the sense that we have just concluded Lucchesi's killer is using Judgment Salt—an obscure alchemical compound known to very few people—and now we discover theatrical evidence of some moral crusader signing their work." Cornelius gestured toward the wall with one wing. "It is too obvious. Too perfectly aligned with our recent conclusions."

"You think someone is attempting to mislead us?" Imelda's voice carried genuine interest rather than challenge.

"I think someone is attempting to appear more ideologically motivated than they actually are." Cornelius's mind was accelerating now, connecting observations into hypothesis. "Consider the timing. We identify the poison. We theorize about moral judgment and righteous execution. And within thirty minutes, a symbol appears that reinforces exactly that narrative."

Melas had pulled out his notebook, pencil poised. "Continue."

"Whoever drew this wanted us to believe we are dealing with a zealot. Someone on a crusade. Someone who will kill again because they are driven by divine mission or moral certainty." Cornelius moved closer to the symbol again, studying the wine-dark eye. "But actual zealots rarely advertise their presence so obviously. True believers commit their acts and trust in the righteousness of their cause. They do not paint symbols on walls like street criminals marking territory."

"Unless they want credit," Zeph said quietly.

Cornelius glanced back at his intern. The boy was leaning against the corridor wall, his face still too pale, his posture suggesting exhaustion. But his eyes were focused, tracking Cornelius's reasoning.

"Credit for what?" Cornelius asked. "Murder? That is called a confession, and it would be monumentally stupid to confess via cryptic Latin when one has thus far avoided detection."

"People do stupid things when they think they are morally justified." Melas tapped his pencil against the notebook. "I have arrested plenty of criminals who could not resist explaining why their victim deserved death."

"True. But those criminals explained after capture, not before. This..." Cornelius indicated the symbol with a dismissive tail-flick. "This is performance. Misdirection."

Imelda had been silent, her ancient gaze moving between Cornelius and the wall. When she spoke, her voice carried the neutral tone of someone presenting data rather than argument. "What alternative do you propose?"

"I propose that our killer is attempting to disguise personal motive as ideological crusade." Cornelius felt certainty crystallizing in his mind, the satisfaction of pattern recognition that characterized his best analytical work. "We have been approaching this incorrectly. We assumed the Judgment Salt indicated a moral vigilante. But what if it simply indicated someone with access to rare alchemical compounds and a flair for dramatic method?"

"You are suggesting the killer chose Judgment Salt for practical rather than philosophical reasons?" Melas sounded skeptical.

"I am suggesting the killer chose it because it was available and spectacularly effective, and then decided to enhance the mystique by adding theatrical elements." Cornelius began pacing, his thoughts organizing themselves into verbal structure. "Consider Valerian. He has academic training. He worked closely with Lucchesi for years—ample time to learn of obscure compounds in the man's reference materials. He felt exploited, betrayed, morally wronged. When he finally decided to act, he selected a poison that would kill only the guilty, thus justifying his own actions in his own mind."

"The Judgment Salt as psychological reassurance rather than public message," Imelda said thoughtfully.

"Precisely. Valerian needed to convince himself that Lucchesi deserved death, that this was justice rather than murder. The Salt provided that reassurance—if Lucchesi died, it proved his guilt objectively." Cornelius's tail moved faster, describing complex arcs. "But then we began investigating. We identified the compound. We started theorizing about moral crusaders and ongoing campaigns. And Valerian realized he needed to reinforce that narrative, make us waste time hunting for phantom zealots while he remained safely classified as mere assistant rather than ideological killer."

Zeph had straightened slightly, his attention fully engaged despite obvious fatigue. "So you think Valerian painted this? As misdirection?"

"I think it fits his pattern of behavior perfectly. He is clever—he ghostwrote sophisticated manuscripts for years. He understands narrative structure and dramatic tension. And he has proven capacity for deception, hiding his authorship while allowing Lucchesi to claim credit." Cornelius stopped pacing, turning to face Melas directly. "He is also still in this building. Still under our supervision. He had opportunity to slip away briefly and create this symbol while we were occupied with other interviews."

Melas made several quick notations. "He was in the reception room with the other key witnesses during the relevant timeframe."

"Was he watched continuously? Every single moment?" Cornelius watched the captain's expression shift infinitesimally—the slight tightening around the eyes that suggested negative answer. "I thought not. We have been focused on preventing escape, not monitoring internal movement. Someone could excuse themselves to the washroom and be gone for fifteen minutes without raising alarm."

"Several people did," Melas admitted. "I have guards posted at exits, not escorts following suspects through corridors."

"Then Valerian had opportunity." Cornelius felt the theory solidifying, becoming not merely hypothesis but conclusion supported by evidence. "He had means—wine is readily available from the catering supplies. He had motive—creating false trail to protect himself. And he certainly had knowledge—any classically educated scholar could produce that Latin phrase."

Imelda tilted her head slightly. "The phrasing was grammatically correct, if artlessly rendered."

"Exactly my point. Valerian would know the proper conjugation but might deliberately execute it poorly to suggest less sophisticated killer." Cornelius moved back to the symbol, examining it with fresh perspective informed by his theory. "Everything about this is calculated to mislead. The crude execution. The theatrical placement. The timing immediately after our discussion of moral crusades."

"It does align suspiciously well with our recent conclusions," Melas said slowly.

"Because Valerian was in the room when we reached those conclusions." Cornelius's voice carried the weight of certainty now. "Imelda explained Judgment Salt to all of us, including her theory about moral enforcement and righteous execution. Valerian heard every word. He then had several hours to consider how that interpretation might benefit him if we pursued it—and several hours to realize he needed to reinforce it if he wanted to avoid being identified as the logical suspect."

Zeph made a small sound—not quite agreement, not quite protest. Cornelius glanced at him.

"You have objection?"

"Not exactly. It's just..." Zeph rubbed his temple, the gesture suggesting his headache had not fully abated. "Valerian didn't seem like someone planning misdirection when we interviewed him. He seemed terrified."

"As he should be. He committed murder." Cornelius dismissed the concern with a tail-flick. "Terror and calculation are not mutually exclusive states. Many criminals experience genuine fear of consequences while simultaneously executing defensive strategies."

"I guess." Zeph did not sound convinced.

Melas was studying his notes, cross-referencing observations. "Walk me through the complete theory. From beginning to end."

Cornelius felt a surge of satisfaction. This was precisely his preferred mode of operation—organized presentation of evidence leading to inevitable conclusion. He positioned himself where all three humans could see him clearly and began.

"Valerian worked as Fabrizio Lucchesi's personal assistant for five years. During that time, he was systematically exploited. He researched, organized, and ultimately ghostwrote Lucchesi's last two books while receiving only minimal acknowledgment and standard compensation. This was intellectual theft on a profound scale—Valerian created the work, Lucchesi claimed the credit and reaped all associated fame and profit."

"Established motive," Melas noted.

"Further complicated by their prior romantic relationship, which ended when Lucchesi chose a more socially advantageous partner but retained Valerian as assistant. This added personal betrayal to professional exploitation." Cornelius adjusted his spectacles, organizing the next section. "Valerian harbored justifiable resentment. Over time, that resentment metastasized into determination to act. But he needed method that would both kill Lucchesi and psychologically confirm to Valerian himself that such killing was justified."

"The Judgment Salt," Imelda said.

"Precisely. Through his work organizing Lucchesi's research materials, Valerian learned of Judgment Salt's existence and properties. Perhaps he encountered references in rare texts. Perhaps Lucchesi himself had researched the compound for one of his own projects. Regardless, Valerian gained knowledge of a poison that only kills the guilty." Cornelius began pacing again, his movements measured and deliberate. "This was perfect for his purposes. If Lucchesi died from the Salt, it proved objectively that Lucchesi deserved death. It transformed murder into execution. It gave Valerian moral cover for what he planned to do."

"Psychological rationalization," Melas said.

"Indeed. So Valerian acquired or created the compound—either through his own alchemical skill or through outside resources we have not yet identified. He then studied Lucchesi's habits, looking for opportunity to administer it. The medication routine was ideal. Lucchesi regularly mixed powder with wine before major events. Valerian knew this schedule intimately. He had access to Lucchesi's private preparation room. All he needed was correct timing."

Cornelius paused, allowing the sequence to unfold in his mind with crystalline clarity.

"The Solterra Gala provided optimal opportunity. Major public event. Lucchesi would certainly take his medication beforehand. And the public nature of the death would create chaos that might obscure investigation." Cornelius's tail traced sharp angles. "Valerian replaced Lucchesi's medication powder with Judgment Salt. Or perhaps he added the Salt to the powder—we will need to test remaining contents of whatever container held the medication. Lucchesi prepared his pre-speech mixture as usual. Consumed it. And died within seconds, exactly as Judgment Salt would cause in a guilty person."

"Which brings us to tonight's interviews," Melas prompted.

"During which Valerian displayed all the behavioral markers of guilt." Cornelius felt the satisfaction of pieces interlocking. "He provided information freely when it served to establish his character as exploited victim. He showed genuine emotional conflict—hatred mixed with grief—because those feelings were authentic. But when directly questioned about the murder itself, he sneezed."

"The Sphinx tell," Imelda observed.

"Precisely. Sphinxes cannot lie without physical symptoms. When asked if he killed Lucchesi, Valerian sneezed. The immediate interpretation was that he lied when denying the killing—that the sneeze indicated deception." Cornelius paused for effect. "Yes, Zeph correctly noted that the sneeze timing was ambiguous. But ambiguity often indicates sophisticated deception rather than innocence. Valerian is clever enough to layer his responses, creating plausible alternative interpretations that cast doubt on the obvious conclusion."

Zeph opened his mouth as if to speak, then closed it again. His expression was difficult to read.

"So you believe the sneezing did indicate he lied about the killing, despite the timing question?" Melas asked.

"I believe Valerian created enough ambiguity to make himself appear less guilty while still unable to fully conceal his involvement. The sneezes are evidence, but so is his behavior pattern—his intimate knowledge of Lucchesi's schedule, his access to rare alchemical compounds through his research work, his demonstrable motive of intellectual theft combined with personal betrayal." Cornelius's voice gained confidence with each supporting detail. "And now, this theatrical symbol appearing precisely when it would most benefit him by redirecting our investigation toward phantom moral crusaders."

Imelda had been listening with her characteristic patience, but now she raised one hand slightly. "You are certain? This is not hypothesis but conclusion?"

"I am certain the evidence supports this interpretation more strongly than any alternative." Cornelius met her ancient gaze directly. "Could I be wrong? Theoretically, yes. Any conclusion based on incomplete information carries possibility of error. But the probability that I am correct exceeds ninety percent based on available data."

"Ninety percent," Melas repeated dryly. "You have calculated this?"

"I have estimated it based on evidential weight and suspect behavior assessment." Cornelius refused to be embarrassed by precision. "The point is that Valerian represents our strongest suspect by substantial margin. Far stronger than vague theories about zealots we have not even identified."

Melas flipped back through his notebook, reviewing previous pages. "We will need additional evidence. Confession would be ideal, but failing that, we need to place him physically at the scene of poison administration with opportunity to tamper with the medication."

"Which is why we should gather all suspects and witnesses together." Cornelius felt the familiar satisfaction of a puzzle approaching solution. "In the Rotunda. Formal presentation of evidence and logical deduction leading to inevitable conclusion."

The captain looked up sharply. "You want to conduct a drawing-room revelation? Like in detective novels?"

"I want to create psychological pressure that yields confession." Cornelius would not apologize for appreciating elegant methodology. "When confronted with complete logical case demonstrating guilt, many criminals find the burden of maintaining innocence intolerable. They confess to end the tension."

"Or they maintain denial and we appear foolish for conducting theatrical accusations without solid proof," Melas countered.

"Then we arrest Valerian anyway based on circumstantial evidence and continue building the case while he is detained. Either outcome is superior to current state of uncertainty." Cornelius spread his wings slightly, emphasizing his point. "We have kept this building locked down for over three hours. People are exhausted. Patience is wearing thin. We need resolution, and we need it soon."

Melas closed his notebook, his weathered face settling into an expression that suggested reluctant agreement. "If we are going to do this, we do it by my procedures. I present the evidence. You may contribute observations, but I lead the interrogation."

"Acceptable." Cornelius had no particular attachment to who delivered the accusation, only that it be delivered effectively.

"And if Valerian does not confess, we proceed with formal arrest and process him through proper channels. No vigilante justice. No library tribunals." Melas's tone made clear this was non-negotiable.

"I am a librarian, not a vigilante. I have no interest in justice beyond ensuring the guilty party is correctly identified and appropriately detained by legal authorities." Cornelius paused. "Though I reserve the right to pursue intellectual satisfaction through complete understanding of method and motive."

"Naturally." The captain's dry inflection suggested amusement. "Very well. I will have the guards assemble everyone in the Rotunda. Key witnesses and any others still present who might have relevant observations."

"Excellent." Cornelius felt energy returning despite the late hour. There was something invigorating about approaching solution, about seeing pattern emerge from chaos. This was what his mind was built for—imposing order through rigorous analysis.

Melas moved toward the corridor exit, already issuing mental commands that would translate into guard mobilization. Imelda followed more slowly, pausing beside Cornelius.

"You are certain?" she asked quietly.

"As certain as logic permits."

"Logic is tool, not truth." Her ancient eyes held his. "Tools can be misapplied."

"I am aware." Cornelius kept his voice level. "But I am also aware that excessive doubt paralyzes action. At some point, one must commit to interpretation and test it against reality."

"Indeed." Imelda touched his wing gently—a gesture of affection that would have irritated him from anyone else. "Mind you test rather than declare."

Then she too departed, leaving Cornelius alone with Zeph in the dim corridor.

The boy had not moved from his position against the wall. His dark eyes followed Cornelius with an expression that might have been concern or might have been simple exhaustion.

"You disagree with my conclusion," Cornelius said. It was not quite question.

"I don't know enough to disagree." Zeph rubbed his temple again. "It's just... when we talked to Valerian, he was scared. Really scared. The kind of scared where you are trying not to fall apart."

"Murderers frequently experience fear. It is called conscience."

"Maybe." Zeph did not sound convinced. "But it felt wrong. Not like guilty-murderer-wrong. Wrong like... like he was terrified of something bigger than getting caught."

Cornelius felt a flicker of irritation. "Vague intuition is not evidence."

"I know. I'm just saying it felt off." Zeph straightened, pushing away from the wall. "But you are probably right. You usually are about this stuff."

The concession should have been satisfying. Instead, it felt somehow hollow—as if Zeph was agreeing not from conviction but from lack of energy to argue.

"We should proceed to the Rotunda," Cornelius said. "Melas will want us positioned appropriately when the suspects arrive."

"Sure." Zeph fell into step beside him as they moved down the corridor. "Can I ask one thing though?"

"You may ask. I may or may not answer."

"If you are so sure it's Valerian... why make a big theatrical show of it? Why not just have Melas arrest him quietly?"

Cornelius considered the question. The honest answer involved elements of ego that he preferred not to examine too closely—the satisfaction of demonstrating superior reasoning, the pleasure of watching disorder resolve into order through his intervention. But there were also practical considerations.

"Because confession simplifies legal proceedings," he said. "And because cornered criminals sometimes reveal information they did not intend to disclose. Method. Accomplices. Additional evidence. The pressure of formal accusation creates fractures in prepared narrative."

"Makes sense." Zeph was quiet for a moment. Then: "You really think he did it?"

"I think the evidence supports that conclusion far more strongly than alternatives."

"That's not the same as yes."

"It is the same as yes within acceptable margin of theoretical uncertainty." Cornelius's tail twitched with renewed irritation. "Why this continued doubt? You yourself noted the suspicious sneeze timing."

"I noted it was weird, not that it proved guilt." Zeph's voice carried unusual firmness. "And I still think Valerian seemed more scared than calculating. But you know way more about this stuff than I do, so probably I am missing something."

They had reached the Rotunda entrance. Through the archway, Cornelius could see guards moving furniture, creating space for the coming assembly. The covered body of Fabrizio Lucchesi still lay on the platform, a shrouded reminder of what this entire night had been about.

"You are not missing something," Cornelius said quietly. "You are experiencing doubt because you prefer people to be innocent. It is generous instinct but poor analytical practice."

"Maybe." Zeph stared at the covered form. "Or maybe I just really want you to be right. Because if you are not, then we are about to accuse an innocent person of murder in front of everyone."

"I am right." Cornelius said it with absolute confidence, feeling certainty settle through his frame like well-fitted armor. "The evidence is clear. The logic is sound. Valerian killed Lucchesi using Judgment Salt to assuage his own guilt while pursuing revenge for exploitation. Everything else—the theatrical symbol, the moral crusade narrative—is misdirection designed to protect himself."

"Okay." Zeph took a deep breath. "Then let's go prove it."

Cornelius spread his wings and glided into the Rotunda, selecting an elevated position on one of the marble columns where he could observe the entire space. Below, guards ushered witnesses and suspects into arranged seating that faced the platform. Valerian entered looking pale and drawn, his Sphinx features tight with tension. Giovanni Conti followed, radiating irritation. The Karellas family arrived as unified unit. Other witnesses and minor suspects filled remaining spaces.

Melas positioned himself on the platform beside Lucchesi's covered body, his posture that of formal authority. Imelda stood to one side, her silver-braided head slightly bowed as if in meditation.

Zeph found a position near the back, leaning against a column. His face was unreadable in the uncertain lamplight.

Cornelius surveyed the assembly with satisfaction. All the pieces were in place. The puzzle was solved. Now came the elegant demonstration of solution—the methodical presentation of evidence leading to inevitable conclusion.

He did love a proper summing up.

"Thank you all for your patience," Melas began, his voice carrying clearly through the Rotunda. "I know this has been a long and difficult night. But we have made significant progress in understanding what happened to Fabrizio Lucchesi. And it is time to share those conclusions."

The assembled crowd shifted, attention focusing with renewed intensity.

Cornelius settled onto his column perch, tail wrapped neatly around his feet, and prepared to watch his theory transform into demonstrated truth.
