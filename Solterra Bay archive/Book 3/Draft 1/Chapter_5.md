# Chapter 5

"You are absolutely not doing this."

Cornelius did not slow his pace down the corridor. His claws clicked against the marble with metronomic precision, each step carrying him closer to the antechamber outside the Mayor's private reception room. His book remained tucked securely under one forearm.

"Your objection is noted and disregarded," he said.

Zeph half-jogged to keep up, his footsteps echoing unevenly behind Cornelius. "Captain Melas specifically told you to stay out of the investigation."

"Captain Melas told me not to interrogate his witnesses while he was conducting interviews. He is currently occupied with processing statements from the outer Rotunda. I am therefore operating within the technical boundaries of his instructions."

"That is the worst logic I have ever heard."

"It is impeccable logic. The flaw lies in your interpretation, not my reasoning." Cornelius reached the antechamber—a narrow space with benches along one wall and a frosted glass window set into the door leading to the reception room proper. He stopped, setting his book carefully on the nearest bench, and turned to face his intern. "I have identified the murder weapon as Judgment Salt. Do you understand what that means?"

Zeph leaned against the wall, arms crossed. The ozone scent around him had faded to a faint trace, which suggested his headache had receded further. "It means someone used fancy poison that only kills guilty people."

"It means," Cornelius corrected, "that someone in that room either knew Lucchesi was guilty of something significant, or believed he was guilty with sufficient conviction to execute him for it. Either scenario requires investigation by someone who understands the implications."

"Someone like Captain Melas. Who is literally a professional investigator."

"Captain Melas is a competent officer operating under severe time and resource constraints. He has perhaps four hours remaining before his legal detention window expires. He must process statements from two dozen remaining witnesses, coordinate with healers and forensic examiners, secure all physical evidence, and maintain chain of custody protocols." Cornelius's tail traced a sharp arc of frustration. "He does not have time to conduct the nuanced interviews this situation demands."

Zeph's expression suggested he was marshaling another argument. Cornelius spoke before the boy could deploy it.

"Furthermore, Captain Melas lacks my specialized knowledge. I have read every major work on aetheric theory published in the last century. I knew Lucchesi's scholarship better than most people in this city, quite possibly better than Lucchesi himself. If his death relates to his work—and given the nature of Judgment Salt, it almost certainly does—then I am uniquely positioned to identify relevant connections."

"Or you just want to solve the mystery before the actual police do."

Cornelius adjusted his spectacles. "That is a contributing factor, yes. I see no reason to deny it."

Despite everything, Zeph's mouth twitched toward something that might have been a smile. "At least you're honest."

"I am always honest. Deception requires remembering false narratives, which clutters the mind unnecessarily." Cornelius turned back toward the frosted glass window. "Now. Are you going to continue objecting, or are you going to assist me?"

"Assist you with what, exactly?"

"Observation. Note-taking. Possibly preventing me from saying something that will cause Captain Melas to have me physically removed from the premises." Cornelius glanced back at the boy. "I am aware that my communication style can be... abrasive."

"You mean you're rude."

"I prefer 'precise.'"

"Most people call it rude."

"Most people are imprecise in their language and become defensive when confronted with clarity." Cornelius moved closer to the window. "Regardless. I value your perspective, and your presence will make me appear less threatening. A dragon accompanied by his assistant is conducting official Library business. A dragon alone is a meddling eccentric."

Zeph pushed away from the wall, moving to stand beside Cornelius. "I'm your human shield."

"You are my diplomatic buffer. There is a distinction."

"Sure there is." But Zeph was looking through the frosted glass now, his curiosity clearly engaged despite his protests. "Can you actually see anything through that?"

"The glass is designed to obscure detail while allowing general observation. Standard administrative architecture." Cornelius tilted his head, adjusting his angle. "But I can see shapes. Movement. Relative positions."

The frosted pane transformed the reception room beyond into an impressionist painting. Blurred figures occupied the space in a loose arrangement that Cornelius's mind automatically began cataloguing. Five people, not counting Imelda, who had positioned herself near the far wall with enviable serenity.

"Tell me what you see," Cornelius said.

Zeph squinted. "Fuzzy people in a fancy room?"

"More specific. Where are they sitting? Who is isolated? Who maintains proximity to others?"

The boy leaned closer, his breath fogging the glass slightly. "Okay. There's someone standing by themselves near the window. Someone else sitting in the center—no, two people sitting together on that couch thing. And another person sort of... off to the side, near the door to Melas's office."

"Excellent. Now apply basic social analysis. Standing alone suggests either grief-driven isolation or deliberate separation from the group. Sitting together indicates alliance or mutual support. Positioning near the office door suggests either anxiety about being called next or strategic placement to observe who enters and exits."

Zeph was quiet for a moment, his analytical mind visibly engaging with the puzzle. "The person by the window is either really upset or doesn't want to talk to the others."

"Both are possible. Continue."

"The two sitting together are probably family or close friends. You don't sit that close to someone unless you know them well or you're trying to present a united front."

Cornelius's tail moved in approval. "Very good. And the one near the office?"

"Nervous. Or controlling. Wants to know what's happening before everyone else does."

"Both viable interpretations." Cornelius committed the positions to memory, cross-referencing them with what he knew of the identified suspects. "Captain Melas named five key witnesses. Valerian, Lucchesi's assistant. Chloe Karellas from the shipping family. The woman in gray who had been speaking with Mayor Barca. And Imelda, though she is present as an institutional representative rather than a suspect."

"That's only four," Zeph said.

"I am aware. Captain Melas did not announce the fifth witness by name, which suggests either they arrived after his initial gathering or their identity is being deliberately withheld for tactical reasons." Cornelius's claws flexed against the windowsill. "However, based on the physical count beyond this glass, we can confirm five individuals plus Imelda. Unless someone has entered or departed since I last observed the room."

Zeph pressed closer to the glass, trying to resolve detail from blur. "Can you tell which one is the Sphinx? The assistant?"

"Valerian would be the tallest figure. Sphinx-kin generally exceed human height by several inches, and their posture tends toward vertical rather than the slight forward curve most humans adopt." Cornelius traced the outline of the standing figure near the window. "That one. Isolated, upright bearing, positioned to observe the entire room. Classic Sphinx positioning—they prefer vantage points that allow comprehensive awareness."

"So he's either grieving or watching everyone else."

"Again, both are possible. He was Lucchesi's assistant. He may be genuinely distressed by his employer's death. Or he may be monitoring the other suspects to gauge their reactions and statements." Cornelius's mind sorted through implications. "Sphinx-kin cannot lie without physical symptoms. That makes Valerian either the most trustworthy witness in that room or the most dangerous, depending on what truths he chooses to reveal."

Zeph shifted his weight, a gesture Cornelius recognized as the boy processing uncomfortable thoughts. "What if he killed Lucchesi?"

"Then he cannot deny it if asked directly. Sphinx physiology would betray the lie." Cornelius considered the logistics. "However, that assumes someone asks the correct question. 'Did you kill Fabrizio Lucchesi' requires a direct answer. 'Do you know who killed him' allows for more nuanced evasion."

"That's terrifying."

"That is useful." Cornelius moved his attention to the paired figures on the couch. "The two sitting together. Based on positioning and body language—even filtered through frosted glass—I would speculate those are the Karellas representatives. Shipping families tend to operate in units. They do not send individuals to important events without support structure."

"So Chloe and who? Her parent?"

"Possible. Or a family retainer. Someone with authority to speak on behalf of the House." Cornelius's tail twitched. "The Karellas family controls a significant portion of Solterra's maritime trade. Their presence at Lucchesi's speech suggests either personal interest in aetheric theory or political obligation. Neither tells us why they would be classified as key witnesses unless they had proximity to the murder itself."

"Maybe they were on the platform?"

"Perhaps. Or perhaps they had prior relationship with Lucchesi that Captain Melas considers relevant." Cornelius filed the question away for later investigation. "We will know more once we speak with them directly."

"Right. Once we break into an active police investigation."

"We are not breaking in. We are entering through an unlocked door to conduct preliminary interviews as representatives of the Library." Cornelius spoke with the confidence of someone who had already constructed his justification and found it sound. "Fabrizio Lucchesi was a published scholar whose work resides in our archives. His death directly impacts the Library's institutional interests. Therefore, Imelda—as Head Librarian—has standing to participate in the investigation, and I—as Library Dragon—am her designated proxy."

Zeph stared at him. "Did you just make that up?"

"I extrapolated from established precedent and institutional authority. Whether that constitutes 'making it up' depends on one's interpretation of legal creativity."

"Melas is going to throw you out."

"Captain Melas is occupied with witness statements and will not be present in the reception room for at least another twenty minutes based on standard interview duration." Cornelius turned away from the frosted glass, retrieving his book from the bench. "By the time he returns, I will have gathered preliminary observations that will prove useful to his investigation. He will be irritated but pragmatic. I am counting on the latter outweighing the former."

"That's a terrible plan."

"It is an efficient plan operating under imperfect conditions." Cornelius tucked the book securely under his arm and moved toward the reception room door. "Now. When we enter, you will remain near the door and observe without speaking unless addressed directly. I will conduct the interviews. If anyone becomes hostile, you will politely suggest we all remain calm and cooperative. Clear?"

Zeph rubbed his temples, a gesture that suggested his headache might be threatening a return. "This is such a bad idea."

"Your objection remains noted and disregarded." Cornelius placed one claw on the door handle, then paused. "Zephyr. I am aware this evening has been difficult for you. The incident with Miss Doukas, the headaches, being trapped in a building with a corpse—none of this was how you intended to spend your night."

The boy's expression shifted, becoming cautious. "Okay?"

"I am offering you the opportunity to be useful. To apply your analytical skills to a genuine mystery rather than dwelling on social failures you could not have prevented." Cornelius met the boy's gaze. "Sometimes the best remedy for personal distress is impersonal focus. A puzzle requires no emotional navigation. It simply requires thought."

Zeph was quiet for a long moment. Then he straightened slightly, his shoulders losing some of their defensive hunch. "You're trying to distract me."

"I am providing you with a constructive alternative to rumination. If that serves a secondary therapeutic function, I consider it an acceptable bonus outcome."

"You're a terrible mentor."

"I am an excellent mentor with unconventional methods." Cornelius returned his attention to the door. "Are you prepared?"

"No."

"Excellent. Neither am I. Excessive preparation breeds hesitation." Cornelius drew himself up to his full height—which remained unimpressive by most standards but which he had learned to deploy with maximum dignified effect. "We are representatives of the Library. We are pursuing institutional interests. We are solving a murder. In that order."

"Pretty sure the murder is first on your actual list."

"My actual list is none of your concern." Cornelius adjusted his spectacles with one claw, straightened the small bow tie he wore for formal occasions, and took a breath that filled his lungs with purpose and his mind with structure.

Then he pushed open the door.

The reception room resolved from blurred impression to sharp reality. The space was exactly as he remembered from his brief earlier presence: elegant chairs arranged in conversational groupings, oil lamps casting steady light across walls decorated with historical maps of Solterra Bay's expansion. The tea service on the sidebar remained untouched.

And there, distributed across the room in precisely the positions Cornelius had deduced from the frosted glass, were the five key witnesses to Fabrizio Lucchesi's death.

Valerian stood by the window, tall and angular, his golden Sphinx eyes tracking Cornelius's entrance with immediate sharp attention. The tufted ears that marked his kind were laid back slightly—not aggressive, but wary. His burgundy robes were immaculate despite the evening's chaos.

On the central couch, two figures sat with the careful proximity of people maintaining unity under pressure. The younger was clearly Chloe Karellas—perhaps twenty years old, with the fine bone structure and silver-touched hair characteristic of siren lineage. Beside her sat a woman who shared enough facial features to be her mother, though older and harder, with the weathered hands of someone who had spent decades on ship decks.

Near the door to Captain Melas's interview office sat a woman in gray, the same one Cornelius had observed speaking with Mayor Barca earlier. Closer proximity revealed details obscured by distance and frosted glass. She was perhaps forty, with dark hair bound in a practical knot and ink stains on her fingers. Her eyes were red from crying, but her posture remained composed.

And in the corner, occupying a chair positioned to observe the entire room, sat a man Cornelius did not recognize from Melas's earlier announcements.

He was older—perhaps sixty—with iron-gray hair and the weathered complexion of someone who spent considerable time outdoors. His clothing was expensive but worn, tailored silk that had seen years of service. He held a walking stick between his knees, both hands resting on its silver handle, and his gaze fixed on Cornelius with the flat assessment of a man evaluating potential threat.

Imelda rose from her position near the far wall, her copper-beaded hair clicking softly. "Cornelius. I was under the impression you were waiting in the antechamber."

"I was. Then I concluded that waiting served no productive purpose." Cornelius moved further into the room, his book held securely. Zeph followed, closing the door quietly behind them and taking up position against the wall with admirable unobtrusiveness. "I am here to conduct preliminary interviews on behalf of the Library's institutional interests."

The man with the walking stick made a sound somewhere between a cough and a laugh. "The dragon's conducting investigations now, is he?"

Cornelius turned to face him fully. "I am Cornelius Drake, Library Dragon of Solterra Bay. I knew Fabrizio Lucchesi's work intimately—better than most people in this city, quite possibly better than he knew it himself. His death impacts the Library's archives and scholarly community, and I am pursuing questions relevant to that impact. You are?"

The man's expression shifted, reassessing. "Giovanni Conti. I worked with Lucchesi twenty years ago, before he decided scholarly integrity was less profitable than popular fiction."

"Ah." Cornelius's mind slotted the name into place immediately. Giovanni Conti had co-authored several papers with Lucchesi in the early days, before their partnership dissolved in acrimony that had become academic legend. "The Aetheric Resonance Theory papers. You contributed the mathematical frameworks."

"I contributed the only parts of those papers worth reading," Giovanni said bitterly. "Lucchesi contributed the presentation and took the credit."

"An arrangement you apparently found unsatisfying."

"Unsatisfying enough that I stopped working with charlatans and started working alone." Giovanni's hands tightened on his walking stick. "Which is why I assume your Captain has me sitting here like a suspect. Old grudges make convenient motives."

"They do," Cornelius agreed calmly. "Though motive alone does not constitute guilt. Means and opportunity matter more."

"I had both." Giovanni's voice was flat. "I know exactly what Judgment Salt is and how it works. I have access to alchemical suppliers through my research. And I was ten feet from the platform when Lucchesi drank his poisoned wine." He met Cornelius's gaze directly. "So if you are here to conduct interviews, Library Dragon, you might as well start with me. I will save you time—yes, I hated Fabrizio Lucchesi. No, I did not kill him. Though I cannot say I am sorry he is dead."

The room held its breath.

Cornelius's tail moved in a slow, thoughtful arc. This was either spectacular honesty or a calculated gambit. Either way, it was interesting.

"I appreciate your directness," Cornelius said. "We will indeed speak, but not first. I prefer to establish context before addressing the most obviously motivated suspect." He turned toward Valerian. "You were Lucchesi's assistant. You worked with him daily. You knew his habits, his schedule, his associations. Tell me—what was Fabrizio Lucchesi actually guilty of?"

Valerian's ears flicked forward. His golden eyes were steady, but something moved behind them. Something careful.

"That," the Sphinx said quietly, "is the question Captain Melas has been trying to answer for the last hour."

"And has he succeeded?"

"Not yet."

"Then perhaps," Cornelius said, settling onto his haunches and tucking his book securely beside him, "we should try a different approach."

He looked around the room, meeting each witness's gaze in turn. The assistant. The rival. The daughter and mother. The woman in gray whose role remained unclear.

One of them knew why Lucchesi had died. One of them might have killed him.

And Cornelius intended to determine which.
