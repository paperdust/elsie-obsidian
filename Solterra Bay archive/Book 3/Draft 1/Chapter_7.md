# Chapter 7

Zeph needed air.

Not literal air—the Mayor's office had plenty of that, even if it smelled like old tobacco and furniture polish. But he needed space. Distance. Something other than the weight of Captain Melas's questions and Cornelius's analyzing stare and the knowledge that somewhere in this building, a dead body lay under a ceremonial cloth.

Also, his head still hurt.

Not the skull-splitting agony from earlier. That had faded to a dull throb that sat behind his eyes like a bruise. Manageable. Survivable. The kind of pain he could work through if he just had a minute to himself.

"I need the washroom," he said quietly.

Cornelius glanced up from where he sat on the Mayor's desk, his golden eyes sharp behind his spectacles. "Again?"

"Yeah. Again." Zeph kept his voice level. "Sorry my bladder isn't as disciplined as yours."

The dragon's tail twitched, but he didn't argue. "Do not wander. Return directly here when finished."

"Sure."

Melas had already left to retrieve Giovanni Conti from the reception room. Zeph slipped out the door before Cornelius could change his mind or assign him some analytical task that required thinking harder than his headache would allow.

The corridor outside was blessedly quiet. Most of the guests had been released from the Rotunda by now, their statements taken and their alibis noted. Only the key witnesses remained, trapped in their elegant waiting room like expensive fish in a bowl.

Zeph turned away from the reception room and the washrooms both, heading deeper into City Hall's administrative warren. He just needed five minutes. Maybe ten. Long enough for his head to stop pounding and for the weird electric feeling under his skin to settle.

Long enough to not think about Sophia's face when the healer had told her there was nothing physically wrong with him.

The corridor opened into a wider gallery. Zeph stopped at the threshold, recognizing the space from a school visit years ago. The Hall of Mayors. A long room lined with portraits of Solterra Bay's civic leaders going back two centuries. Between the paintings, bronze plaques marked the Tile Family sponsorships—intricate mosaics showcasing which house had funded which year's civic improvements.

The gallery was dim. Someone had turned down the oil lamps to save fuel now that the official ceremonies were over. The portraits hung in pools of shadow, their painted eyes watching Zeph with the judgment of the historically important dead.

Perfect.

Zeph moved into the room, his footsteps loud on the marble floor. He found a bench positioned beneath a portrait of some mayor from fifty years ago—a stern-looking satyr with magnificent horns—and sat down hard.

His hands were shaking slightly.

He pressed them flat against his thighs, willing them to stop. This was stupid. He was fine. The headache was fading. He'd caught an important detail during Valerian's interrogation—noticed the timing of the sneezes when even Cornelius had missed it. That was good. That was useful.

That was exactly the kind of thing he was supposed to be doing as Cornelius's intern.

So why did he feel like he was falling apart?

"There you are."

Zeph's head snapped up. Sophia stood at the gallery entrance, backlit by the corridor's brighter lamps. Her formal gown—deep blue silk that her mother had spent a fortune on—caught the light as she moved toward him. Her face was composed now, the earlier tears gone, but her posture was rigid.

"Hey," Zeph said. His voice came out rougher than intended. "I was just—"

"Running away again?"

The words hit like a slap. Zeph felt his spine straighten defensively. "I wasn't running away. I needed a minute to clear my head."

"Right. Like you needed a minute during dinner with my parents. And a minute before my cousin's recital. And a minute at the Spring Festival when my mother specifically asked to speak with you." Sophia stopped a few feet away, arms crossed. "You always need a minute, Zeph."

"That's not fair."

"Isn't it?" Her voice was calm, which somehow made it worse. Anger he could have handled. This quiet disappointment felt like drowning. "You promised tonight would be different. You said you'd meet my family properly. You said you'd try."

"I did try!" The words came out louder than Zeph intended. He forced himself to lower his volume. "I was there. I said the thing about the mosaics, exactly like Cornelius taught me. I was doing it."

"Until you ran to the washroom and disappeared for twenty minutes." Sophia's jaw tightened. "My mother thinks you were sick from nerves. My father thinks you're rude. And I had to stand there smiling like nothing was wrong while your absence made me look like an idiot."

The word hung between them. Idiot. Not him—her. She thought his problems made *her* look bad.

"I had a headache," Zeph said flatly. "A really bad one. I told you that."

"You always have a headache. Or your stomach hurts. Or you're too tired. Or something." Sophia's composure cracked slightly, frustration bleeding into her voice. "And then tonight, when it actually mattered, you did it again. Even after the healer said there was nothing wrong with you."

"The healer was wrong."

"Was she?" Sophia took a step closer. "Or do you just not want to be here? Because if you don't want to meet my family, if you don't want to do the work of actually being together in public, you could just say so. It would be kinder than making me guess whether you're actually sick or just avoiding things that make you uncomfortable."

Zeph stood up. The movement made his head throb, but he ignored it. "You think I'm faking?"

"I think something is always conveniently wrong with you when I need you to be present." Sophia's voice wavered. "I think I keep making excuses for you, and you keep proving that maybe I shouldn't."

The air between them felt charged. Electric. Like the moment before lightning struck.

Zeph's hands clenched at his sides. He wanted to explain. Wanted to tell her about the way crowds scraped against his skin like sandpaper, how loud noises felt like knives in his skull, how sometimes the world narrowed to a crushing point of pain that made thinking impossible.

But how could he explain something he didn't understand himself?

"It's real," he said quietly. "The headaches. The sensitivity. All of it. I'm not making it up, and I'm not trying to embarrass you."

"Then what *are* you trying to do?" Sophia's eyes were bright with unshed tears. "Because from where I'm standing, it looks like you're perfectly fine working for Cornelius on library projects or solving murder mysteries with the Watch, but the moment I need you to stand beside me for an hour and smile at my mother, you fall apart."

That wasn't fair. That wasn't—

Except it kind of was, wasn't it?

Zeph had managed to observe Valerian's interrogation. Had noticed the sneeze timing. Had walked through corridors and climbed stairs and functioned adequately once the immediate crisis of the Rotunda's chaos had passed.

But he hadn't been able to stand in front of Sophia's family for five minutes without fleeing.

"It's different," he said helplessly. "The investigation is—I can focus on it. It's external. A puzzle. Your family is..."

"Stressful?" Sophia's laugh was bitter. "My family is stressful, but a murder investigation is relaxing? Do you hear yourself?"

"That's not what I meant."

"Then what did you mean?"

Zeph opened his mouth. Closed it. He didn't know how to explain that his brain could handle analyzing evidence and tracking details because those things had rules. Clear cause and effect. Observable patterns.

But social situations—especially high-pressure ones with Tile Family matriarchs judging his career prospects and his worthiness to date their daughter—those had no rules he understood. No patterns he could follow. Just endless chances to fail.

"I meant," he said slowly, "that I'm trying. I know I'm not good at this stuff. I know your family thinks I'm just some random library intern with no prospects. But I'm doing my best."

"Your best leaves me standing alone explaining your absence to my mother." Sophia's voice cracked. "Your best makes me look like someone who can't even keep her date from running away."

"I wasn't running away from you."

"That's what it feels like."

The words settled between them like stones. Zeph felt something in his chest twist painfully. This wasn't how tonight was supposed to go. He'd rehearsed the mosaic compliment. Worn his good shirt. Tried so hard to be the kind of person who could stand beside a Doukas daughter without making her regret it.

And he'd failed anyway.

"I'm sorry," he said quietly. "I know I keep screwing this up. But I swear, Sophia, I'm not trying to embarrass you. The headaches are real. I just—I don't know what's wrong with me."

Sophia stared at him for a long moment. Something in her expression shifted. Not softening exactly, but changing. When she spoke again, her voice was tired.

"Maybe that's the problem. You don't know what's wrong, so you can't fix it. And I can't keep making excuses for something neither of us understands." She wrapped her arms around herself. "I need to think about whether this is working. Whether we're working."

Zeph's stomach dropped. "What does that mean?"

"It means I don't know if I can do this anymore. The uncertainty. The constant wondering if you'll actually show up or if I'll be left explaining your absence again." She looked away. "I care about you, Zeph. But I can't be the only one holding this together."

"You're not—"

"I am." Sophia met his gaze again. "I'm the one making plans around your limitations. Choosing quiet restaurants. Avoiding my family's big events. Pretending I don't mind when you disappear. And I've done it gladly because I thought you were worth it. But tonight..."

She trailed off. Shook her head.

"I should get back to my family. They'll wonder where I am." She turned toward the corridor, then paused. "When you figure out what's actually going on with you—or when you decide to be honest about what you really want—you can find me. Until then, I need space."

Then she was gone, her footsteps echoing down the corridor.

Zeph stood frozen beneath the portrait of the long-dead satyr mayor. His hands had started shaking again. The headache, which had faded to a manageable throb, suddenly spiked—a sharp lance of pain behind his right eye that made him gasp.

And beneath it, the electric feeling. The sense of pressure building in the air around him. The smell like ozone before a storm.

He pressed the heel of his hand against his temple, breathing slowly. In for four counts. Hold for four. Out for four. The technique Cornelius had taught him.

It helped. Marginally.

When he could think clearly again, Zeph made himself move. He couldn't stay here staring at portraits and feeling sorry for himself. Cornelius would want to know what had taken so long. Melas probably had Giovanni Conti in the office by now, and Zeph was supposed to be observing, learning, making himself useful.

Proving he was worth something even if Sophia didn't think so anymore.

He turned back toward the corridor—and stopped.

Voices. Low and tense, coming from the far end of the gallery where a smaller hallway branched off toward the administrative offices.

Zeph moved quietly toward the sound. His headache made stealth easier than usual—he was already moving carefully to avoid jarring his skull.

Two figures stood in the shadowed alcove near a door marked "Records Storage—Authorized Personnel Only." One was tall and broad-shouldered, dressed in expensive evening clothes with the sharp tailoring that marked wealth. The other was smaller, wearing servant's livery, their posture hunched and deferential.

"—told you to keep it quiet," the larger man was saying. His voice carried edges of aristocratic authority and poorly suppressed anger. "The shipment should have been processed three days ago. Why am I hearing about delays now?"

"Sir, the dockmaster noticed irregularities in the customs forms. He flagged them for review—"

"Then *un-flag* them. That is what we pay him for, is it not?"

The servant shifted uncomfortably. "He's nervous, sir. After the Veneti scandal last year, everyone's being more careful with maritime imports. He says if the Harbor Authority decides to inspect—"

"The Harbor Authority will not inspect because they will not have reason to." The larger man stepped closer, using his height to loom. "You will go to the dockmaster tonight—yes, tonight, I do not care that it is late—and you will remind him that our arrangement benefits him far more than strict adherence to bureaucratic oversight. Clear?"

"Yes, sir. Of course, sir."

"And the other matter? The one I specifically told you to handle personally?"

"The documents are secured. No one has access except—"

"Good. Keep it that way." The man's voice lowered further. "Given tonight's unfortunate event with Lucchesi, we cannot afford additional scrutiny. Everything must appear perfectly legitimate."

Zeph's breath caught. Lucchesi?

He pressed himself against the wall where the gallery met the alcove, making himself as small as possible. His heart hammered against his ribs. The headache spiked again—bright and sharp—but he forced himself to stay still.

"What about the Kallistos inquiry?" the servant asked.

"Stall them. Claim processing delays due to the festival preparations." The man adjusted his jacket with sharp, irritated movements. "And for heaven's sake, keep the family name out of official correspondence. Use the shell companies. That is literally why we established them."

"Yes, sir. I understand."

"You had better." The man turned toward the gallery exit—toward where Zeph was hiding.

Zeph stopped breathing. His headache had evolved into something worse—the full electric pressure of imminent danger, the feeling that used to precede his worst episodes. The ozone smell filled his nose, sharp and acrid.

The man strode past without noticing him. Zeph caught a glimpse of his profile in the dim lamplight—strong features, graying temples, the confident bearing of someone born to command.

Pavlos Karellas. He'd been sitting with Chloe and Irene in the reception room. Shipping family. Powerful enough to worry about rival Tile Families and harbor inspections and documents that needed to stay "secured."

The servant scurried after him, practically jogging to keep up.

Zeph waited until their footsteps faded completely before he let himself breathe again. His hands were shaking worse than before. The headache had become a living thing, pulsing in time with his racing heartbeat.

But his mind was working.

Pavlos Karellas was involved in something shady. Something that required bribing dockmasters and hiding documents and using shell companies. Something connected enough to Lucchesi that Pavlos was worried about scrutiny "given tonight's unfortunate event."

That seemed important.

That seemed like something Cornelius needed to know.

Zeph pushed away from the wall and headed back toward the Mayor's office, forcing his legs to move steadily despite the way his head throbbed with each step. The corridor seemed longer than before, the oil lamps casting shadows that moved wrong.

He was probably imagining that last part. Headache hallucinations were a thing, right?

By the time he reached the office door, Zeph had his story prepared. He'd been delayed. He'd gotten turned around in the corridors. Totally normal.

He pushed the door open.

Inside, Cornelius sat on the desk in his usual position of maximum authority. Captain Melas occupied the mayor's chair. And seated in the interview chair, looking distinctly annoyed about it, was Pavlos Karellas.

The man's eyes flicked to Zeph as he entered, then dismissed him as unimportant. Just the dragon's assistant. Some kid.

Zeph kept his expression neutral and moved to his usual observation spot near the back wall. His heart was still racing. The headache made thinking difficult, but he forced himself to focus.

Cornelius caught his gaze briefly. One scaled eyebrow rose a fraction—a silent question. *Where were you?*

Zeph gave the smallest nod. *Later.*

The dragon's tail twitched acknowledgment, then his attention returned to Pavlos.

"—understand your time is valuable, Master Karellas," Melas was saying, his notebook open. "I will try to be brief."

"Please do." Pavlos adjusted his cufflinks with the air of a man accustomed to far more important meetings. "I have already explained that I barely knew Lucchesi personally. Our business relationship was minimal."

"Yet you attended his speech tonight."

"My daughter is interested in aetheric theory. I accompanied her as a courtesy."

Cornelius's golden eyes gleamed behind his spectacles. "A courtesy that required your wife's presence as well? Interesting. Most fathers would simply send a note of permission."

Pavlos's jaw tightened almost imperceptibly. "My wife and I support our daughter's intellectual pursuits. Is there a crime in that?"

"None whatsoever," Cornelius said pleasantly. "Though it does suggest the evening held more significance than mere academic curiosity might warrant."

The man's fingers drummed once against the chair arm—a tiny gesture of irritation quickly suppressed.

Zeph leaned against the wall and watched. His headache throbbed. The ozone smell lingered faintly in his nose.

And somewhere in this building, a murderer was waiting to be found.

Probably not the same person who was bribing dockmasters and hiding shipping documents.

Probably.

But Zeph had learned enough tonight to know that probably wasn't the same as certainly.

He made himself focus through the pain and watched Pavlos Karellas lie to the dragon and the captain about things that might matter more than any of them yet understood.
