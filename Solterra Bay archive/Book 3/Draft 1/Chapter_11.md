# Chapter 11

The screaming had not stopped.

Cornelius remained frozen on his column perch, claws locked into marble that felt suddenly unstable beneath him. Below, the Rotunda had transformed into a churning mass of bodies and noise. Guards shouted contradictory orders. Witnesses surged toward exits or pressed closer to the platform where Valerian lay convulsing. Someone was crying—high, keening sobs that cut through the deeper chaos like a knife through parchment.

His analytical mind continued processing despite everything, cataloguing details with mechanical precision: Imelda kneeling beside Valerian's seizing form, her hands moving in practiced healing gestures. Melas barking commands, trying to establish perimeter and order. The Karellas women still seated but gripping each other's hands with white-knuckled force. Giovanni Conti standing, his face blank with shock.

And Zeph. Still pressed against the back wall. No longer covering his face but watching the scene with an expression Cornelius could not parse from this distance. Not triumph. Not even relief at being proven right.

Something worse. Something that looked almost like pity.

The ozone scent had faded, leaving only the familiar smells of the Rotunda—old stone, lamp oil, the lingering wine-sweetness from Lucchesi's spilled glass. As if atmospheric reality itself was denying what had just occurred.

But Valerian's body told the truth. His convulsions were slowing now, the terrible rigidity giving way to limpness that suggested either stabilization or complete system failure. Foam still flecked his leonine muzzle. His breathing came in shallow, irregular gasps.

Identical presentation to Lucchesi's death. Exactly identical.

Which meant Judgment Salt. Which meant guilt. Which meant Valerian had not been lying when he denied murder, because the Salt would not have killed him if he had committed that particular sin. Which meant everything Cornelius had concluded, every logical inference he had constructed and announced with absolute certainty, had been wrong.

Not merely incomplete. Not slightly miscalibrated. Catastrophically, mortally wrong.

He had assembled this tribunal. Had positioned Valerian in that specific chair. Had created the psychological pressure that drove the Sphinx to reach for water. Had ignored Zeph's warnings and Imelda's cautions and his own brief flicker of doubt about the sneeze timing because the pattern had been so elegant, the solution so satisfyingly complete.

His ninety percent certainty had killed an innocent person.

No. Not killed. Valerian still breathed, however shallowly. Still existed in that terrible space between life and death where healing might yet prevail.

But Cornelius had placed him there as surely as if he had administered the poison personally.

"Drake." Melas's voice cut through the chaos and Cornelius's spiraling thoughts. "Drake, get down here."

Cornelius tried to respond. Found his throat would not produce sound. His wings remained frozen in their half-spread position, his tail rigid against the column.

"Now, Drake." Not shouting. Worse than shouting—the flat command tone that expected immediate obedience.

His body moved before conscious thought engaged. Wings folding, claws releasing marble, controlled descent to the platform. Landing felt wrong, as if gravity itself had shifted parameters and he could no longer trust basic physics.

Melas was there immediately, one weathered hand closing around Cornelius's midsection and lifting him bodily from the platform. Not gently. Not with particular care for dignity or comfort.

"Office," the captain said. "Now."

Cornelius did not protest as he was carried through the crowd. People moved aside without being asked, their faces blurring into undifferentiated expressions of shock and fear. The guards had established a corridor from platform to exit, keeping the assembly from complete stampede.

Behind them, Imelda's voice rose in careful incantation. Healing work. The ancient syllables that shaped flesh and mended damage. Whether she could reverse Judgment Salt's effects remained unknown. Whether Valerian would survive the attempt remained unknown.

Whether it mattered remained unknown, because Cornelius had already condemned him in front of everyone present.

The Mayor's office was dark when Melas shouldered through the door. No lamps lit, no preparation made for their return. The captain deposited Cornelius on the desk with enough force to rattle the inkwell, then moved to the lamp and struck flame with movements that suggested barely controlled violence.

Light bloomed. The familiar office resolved from shadow—same carved desk, same civic maps, same orderly arrangements that had seemed reassuring hours ago. Now it felt like stage dressing, false comfort designed to mask fundamental disorder.

Melas stood by the desk, his weathered face illuminated from below by the lamp. The shadows carved his features into harsh angles, aging him a decade. His hands gripped the desk edge.

"What," he said with terrible quietness, "did you just do?"

Cornelius's throat worked. No sound emerged.

"That was not rhetorical question, Drake. I am asking you to explain the sequence of events that led to a second poisoning in my locked-down crime scene."

"I—" His voice sounded foreign. Thin. Uncertain. "I concluded that Valerian was the killer based on available evidence. Motive, means, opportunity. The Sphinx physiological response indicating—"

"You concluded wrong." Melas's knuckles were white against dark wood. "And your wrongness just got someone poisoned during an official tribunal that you insisted on staging."

"The logical framework was sound." Even as he said it, Cornelius knew how hollow it sounded. How defensive. "The evidence supported—"

"The evidence supported what you wanted it to support because you love being right more than you love being careful." Melas pushed away from the desk, pacing to the window and back. "I trusted your reasoning. I let you build that case. I stood up there and presented your accusations as fact. And now we have a second victim who may or may not survive the night."

"He is not dead." The words emerged before Cornelius could evaluate their utility. "Imelda is skilled. If anyone can reverse the effects—"

"That is not the point!" Melas's palm hit the desk with enough force to make the lamp jump. "The point is that we—that I—conducted a public accusation of an innocent person and created exactly the circumstances that allowed the actual killer to strike again. In our secure location. Under our supervision. While we were too busy being clever to notice what was actually happening."

Silence stretched between them. Cornelius's tail lay absolutely still. His wings remained folded tight against his body.

"You told me you were ninety percent certain," Melas said finally. His voice had dropped back to dangerous quietness. "Do you remember that? Ninety percent probability that Valerian was our killer."

"Yes."

"And I believed you. Because you are Library Dragon. Because you have served as consultant on difficult cases before. Because everyone says Cornelius Drake sees patterns no one else can see, makes deductions no one else can make." Melas's expression was unreadable. "I trusted your ninety percent."

"The trust was misplaced." The words tasted like ashes. "I was wrong."

"You were worse than wrong. You were arrogant." Melas moved to the office door, opened it slightly. The sounds of ongoing chaos filtered through—running footsteps, shouted orders, someone weeping. "And your arrogance just became my problem, because now I have to explain to the Mayor how we went from one dead scholar to one dead scholar and one dying Sphinx, all while the actual murderer remains free."

"I did not intend—"

"Intent does not matter. Results matter." Melas turned back, his face carved with exhaustion. "And the result is that you are done with this investigation. Finished. You will return to your library and remain there until I say otherwise."

The words should have felt like relief. Should have offered escape from this disaster.

Instead they felt like confirmation of complete failure.

"Captain." Cornelius forced his voice to steadiness. "The real killer is still here. Still in this building. They prepared that poisoned glass. They knew or predicted that we would accuse Valerian. They used our logic against us."

"I am aware." Melas's tone suggested this observation contributed nothing useful. "Which is why I am taking different approach going forward. No more elegant theories. No more theatrical confrontations. We are going back to basics. Guard every witness. Check every cup and glass. Process every person through formal interview and detention if necessary."

"But—"

"You are done, Drake." Melas's weathered face was set. "I appreciate your previous assistance. I even acknowledge that some of your observations were valuable before tonight. But you just demonstrated that your methods are dangerous, and I cannot afford another catastrophe."

Movement in the doorway drew both their attention. A guard stood there, young woman with Harbor Watch insignia.

"Captain. The healer says the Sphinx is stable. Unconscious but breathing. She recommends transport to the infirmary for continued treatment."

Melas nodded shortly. "Make it happen. Full guard escort. No one approaches him except authorized medical staff."

The guard saluted and departed. Her footsteps retreated down the corridor.

Stable. Not dead. The relief was profound and entirely insufficient to address the magnitude of what Cornelius had done.

"At least he survived," Cornelius said quietly.

"He survived being poisoned with Judgment Salt." Melas's voice carried no softness. "Which means he is genuinely guilty of something serious enough to trigger the compound. We just proved he is not guilty of Lucchesi's murder, but he is guilty of something."

The implication settled through Cornelius's analytical mind. "You intend to charge him anyway."

"I intend to detain him for his own protection and for further investigation." Melas returned to the desk, pulled out the chair, sat heavily. "Once he is conscious and capable of statement, we will determine what he is actually guilty of. But yes, given that Judgment Salt only affects those with serious transgression, he has committed some crime worth pursuing."

"But not murder. Not this murder." Cornelius's tail twitched once. "Charging him with Lucchesi's death would be—"

"Wrong. I know." Melas rubbed his face with both hands. "But I need to give the Mayor something. Some answer. Some sense that we have not completely lost control of this situation. And a guilt-proven suspect who survives his own attempted suicide via the same poison that killed our victim is... politically convenient."

The words hit like physical impact. "You would charge an innocent person to satisfy political pressure."

"I would detain a demonstrably guilty person—guilty of something—while investigating whether he had accomplice or additional motive we have not yet uncovered." Melas's eyes were hard. "And before you climb onto moral high ground, remember that you are the one who publicly accused him of murder an hour ago. This is cleanup. Damage control. Making sure the actual killer does not claim any more victims while we figure out what actually happened."

Cornelius had no response. The logic was sound. Politically expedient. Professionally defensible.

And completely, utterly wrong in exactly the way his own accusation had been wrong—prioritizing neat resolution over messy truth.

"You see the problem," Melas said quietly. It was not question.

"Yes."

"Good. Then you understand why you are removed from this case. Because I cannot afford another instance of clever reasoning leading to disaster." The captain pulled paper toward him, uncapped his pen. "I am going to draft charges for attempted suicide by poison, with investigation ongoing for conspiracy to commit murder. It gives me legal ground to hold Valerian, protects him from the actual killer, and satisfies the Mayor's need for progress. It is not truth. But it is stability."

"Stability built on false foundation." Cornelius's voice was hollow.

"Better than chaos built on arrogant certainty." Melas began writing, his pen scratching across paper with methodical precision. "You should go. There is side exit through the records corridor. Avoid the Rotunda. I will send word when the lockdown is officially lifted, but you are free to leave now."

Dismissed. Expelled. Removed from investigation he had wanted to avoid in the first place but had inserted himself into with absolute confidence in his ability to restore order.

Cornelius spread his wings. Folded them again. The movement felt purposeless.

"Captain Melas."

"What." Not looking up from his writing.

"I was wrong. About Valerian. About the method. About—" Everything. The word lodged in his throat. "I apologize for the harm caused."

Melas's pen stopped moving. He looked up, his weathered face unreadable.

"I know you are. But apology does not undo the damage." He returned to writing. "Go home, Drake. Return to your books. Leave justice to those of us who understand that being right is less important than being careful."

The words were dismissal and condemnation both. Cornelius had nothing to offer in response.

He flew from the desk to the doorframe, then to the corridor beyond. The records passage stretched ahead, dark and empty. Behind him, Melas continued writing, the scratch of pen on paper providing rhythm to Cornelius's retreat.

The corridor was blessedly deserted. Everyone was occupied with the aftermath—securing Valerian for transport, calming the assembled witnesses, establishing new order after Cornelius's elegant theory had shattered existing structure.

He flew rather than walked, needing the physical exertion even though the distance was minimal. His wings moved with mechanical precision. His navigation required no thought—this was City Hall, civic building he had visited dozens of times for various archival consultations.

The side exit appeared ahead, unmarked door that led to service alley. Cornelius landed, pressed the release bar with one foreclaw, and emerged into night air.

The alley was quiet. Dark stone walls rising on either side. The smell of kitchen waste from bins awaiting morning collection. Above, a narrow strip of sky showed stars—distant points of light that had witnessed this entire disaster with complete indifference.

He should return to the Library. Should find Imelda once she finished with Valerian and report his removal from the investigation. Should resume his normal duties—cataloguing, organizing, maintaining the orderly systems that defined his existence and purpose.

Should stop thinking about Valerian's terrified face. About Zeph's warning coming too late. About his own certainty crumbling into ash and taking an innocent person's freedom with it.

The signed first edition was still in the Mayor's office. He had left it there during the tribunal assembly, too focused on his elegant demonstration to remember the rare book that had started this entire night.

Appropriate, somehow. Lucchesi's inscription about knowledge and truth now sat in the same room where Melas was drafting false charges to satisfy political necessity. Both artifacts of comfortable lies disguised as rigorous certainty.

Cornelius stood in the alley, wings folded, tail still. The night was quiet except for distant sounds of the city—occasional voice, echoing footsteps on stone, the eternal background rhythm of settlement that never quite slept.

He had failed. Had been wrong in precisely the way that caused maximum harm. Had ignored warnings and dismissed doubts and constructed perfect logic that proved perfectly false.

And somewhere in the locked building behind him, the actual killer was free. Still unidentified. Still dangerous. Still one step ahead of investigation that had been too clever for its own good.

Cornelius spread his wings and flew toward the Library, leaving behind the scene of his greatest intellectual disaster and the book that now felt like monument to fraud.

Behind him, City Hall continued its chaos. Ahead, the Library waited—silent, orderly, safe.

Exactly where he should have remained all along.
