# Chapter 2

The scream cut through the Rotunda like a blade through parchment.

Cornelius's first instinct was to protect his book. He wrapped both forearms around the leather binding and pressed it against his chest, wings half-spread to shield it from the surge of bodies that would inevitably follow panic. A crowd in chaos had no respect for rare manuscripts.

His second instinct was to curse his own curiosity for keeping him here.

The Grand Rotunda transformed in the space of three heartbeats. The elegant assembly of Solterra's finest citizens became a writhing mass of silk and terror. Someone knocked over a serving tray. Crystal shattered. Wine spread across the geometric marble floor in branching rivulets that reminded Cornelius unpleasantly of arterial patterns.

On the platform, Fabrizio Lucchesi lay motionless.

The author had fallen on his side, one arm flung out as if reaching for something just beyond his grasp. His elaborate cravat had come undone during his collapse, the silk pooling beneath his cheek. From this distance, Cornelius could not tell if the man's chest still moved. The spilled wine from Lucchesi's glass had spread around his head like a dark halo.

"Someone fetch a healer!" Mayor Barca's voice boomed across the chaos. The orc stood at the edge of the platform, her formal robes billowing as she gestured sharply at her attendants. "Now! And clear this space!"

No one cleared. If anything, the crowd pressed closer, everyone craning for a better view of the fallen celebrity. Cornelius recognized the pattern. He had seen it before at public lectures when a visiting scholar fainted from the heat—humans possessed a morbid fascination with witnessing disaster firsthand.

"Master Drake." Zeph's voice came from somewhere below Cornelius's perch by the column. "Master Drake, I think I need to—"

The boy's words cut off. Cornelius looked down sharply.

Zeph had gone white. Not the grayish pallor from earlier, but a true bloodless white that made his dark skin look waxen. He had pressed himself against the column as if it were the only thing keeping him upright. Both hands clutched his head. His eyes were squeezed shut, and his jaw was clenched so tightly that Cornelius could see the muscle jumping in his cheek.

"Zephyr." Cornelius adjusted his grip on his book and climbed down the column with careful precision, using his claws to find purchase in the carved acanthus leaves. "Look at me."

The boy did not respond. His breathing had gone rapid and shallow.

Cornelius reached the floor and moved to Zeph's side, positioning himself between the boy and the churning crowd. Up close, he could see that Zeph was trembling. A fine sheen of perspiration covered his forehead despite the cool temperature of the Rotunda.

And there—that scent again. Sharper now. Like the air before lightning struck.

"Breathe," Cornelius ordered, pitching his voice to cut through whatever internal storm the boy was experiencing. "Slowly. Count to four on the inhale."

Zeph managed a shaky breath. Then another. Some of the tension in his shoulders eased, though his hands remained pressed to his temples.

"Better?" Cornelius asked.

"No." Zeph's voice was barely a whisper. "Everything's too loud. Too bright. I can feel people moving and it's like—like they're all scraping against my skin at once."

An unusual description. Cornelius filed it away for later analysis. "Can you stand without support?"

"I think so."

"Can you walk?"

"Maybe. Why?"

"Because we are leaving." Cornelius glanced back at the platform, where Mayor Barca and two of her attendants had formed a barrier around Lucchesi's body. A woman in healer's robes was pushing through the crowd, her bag clutched in both hands. "This is no longer our concern."

"But Sophia—"

"Will understand that you are unwell." Cornelius nudged Zeph's leg with his tail. "You can barely remain conscious. You are in no state to provide comfort or support to anyone, least of all yourself. We are extracting you from this situation before you collapse and I have to explain to Imelda why I allowed my intern to crack his skull on historic marble."

Zeph opened his eyes to slits. "You're worried about the marble?"

"I am worried about the paperwork." Cornelius spread one wing and used it to block an overly curious guest who had drifted too close to their position. "And about you, in that order. Now move. Slowly. Use the column for balance if needed."

The boy pushed away from the stone and took one careful step. Then another. Cornelius stayed close, ready to intervene if Zeph's legs gave out. They made slow progress toward the eastern colonnade, away from the platform and the press of bodies.

Behind them, the healer reached Lucchesi's side. Cornelius risked a glance back.

The woman knelt by the fallen author, her hands already glowing with the soft amber light of diagnostic magic. She touched Lucchesi's throat, his wrist, his chest. Her expression, initially focused and professional, went carefully blank.

Cornelius knew that look. He had seen it on the face of the healer who had attended to the previous Head Archivist during the man's final illness. It was the expression of someone delivering bad news they had delivered too many times before.

The healer stood and spoke quietly to Mayor Barca. The Mayor's face, visible even from this distance, hardened into a mask of controlled fury.

Dead, then. Lucchesi was dead.

Cornelius felt a small, cold weight settle in his chest. He had not particularly liked the man—the later novels had been insufferable, and the speech tonight had confirmed Cornelius's suspicion that Lucchesi's serious scholarly days were long behind him. But the author had signed Cornelius's book. Had called him a fellow scholar. Had written *The Theory of Aether*, which had shaped an entire generation's understanding of fundamental magical principles.

And now he was gone, collapsed in the middle of a toast, in front of half of Solterra's elite.

"Master Drake?" Zeph had stopped walking. He leaned heavily against one of the colonnade's pillars, his eyes still closed. "Is he...?"

"I believe so." Cornelius scanned the crowd, looking for the fastest route to the exit. Most of the guests had their backs turned, their attention fixed on the platform. A few were already whispering to each other, their faces alight with the particular animation that came from being present at a scandal. "Which makes it even more imperative that we depart before the Watch arrives and seals the building for questioning."

"They'd do that?"

"A prominent citizen has died suddenly at a public event. Captain Melas will treat this as suspicious until proven otherwise." Cornelius adjusted his spectacles, thinking. "He will want statements from everyone present. That process could take hours."

Zeph swallowed hard. "I can't do hours. I can barely do minutes."

"Precisely." Cornelius's gaze caught on a service entrance partially hidden behind a tall arrangement of hothouse flowers. "This way. Quickly."

They moved as fast as Zeph's condition allowed, which was not particularly fast. Cornelius kept his book tucked close and his senses alert. The last thing he needed was for someone to notice them leaving and decide that fleeing the scene looked suspicious.

They were three feet from the service entrance when a familiar figure stepped into their path.

Sophia Doukas had clearly been crying, though she had composed herself with admirable speed. Her eyes were red-rimmed, and she clutched a lace handkerchief in one hand. She looked at Zeph with an expression that managed to combine concern, frustration, and something that might have been disappointment.

"Zephyr." Her voice was soft but firm. "Where are you going?"

"I—" Zeph wavered on his feet. "I'm not feeling well. I was going to—"

"Run away again?" Sophia's tone did not quite qualify as sharp, but it was close. "Like you did from my mother?"

Cornelius felt his scales prickle with irritation. He did not have time for young human romantic drama, and Zeph certainly was not in a state to navigate it. He stepped forward, positioning himself between the two teenagers.

"Miss Doukas." He kept his voice polite but unyielding. "Zephyr has been suffering from an acute medical condition for the past hour. He requires rest and quiet, neither of which are available in this environment. I am escorting him home."

Sophia's gaze dropped to Cornelius, then back to Zeph. "He can't even speak for himself?"

"I can speak," Zeph managed. "I just... Sophia, I tried. I really tried with your mom, but my head—"

"Always your head." Sophia's fingers tightened on her handkerchief. "It's always something, isn't it? Whenever something important happens, you have a headache, or you're tired, or you're overwhelmed. Do you know how that looks to my family?"

Cornelius's tail lashed once, a sharp movement that drew Sophia's attention immediately.

"Miss Doukas," he said, his voice dropping into the register he reserved for particularly difficult research assistants who needed correction. "Your concern for appearances is noted. However, Zephyr's physical distress is quite real, and I have neither the time nor the patience to debate its legitimacy. We are leaving. You may speak with him tomorrow when he is capable of coherent conversation."

Sophia's cheeks flushed. "I wasn't—"

"You were." Cornelius adjusted his spectacles with one claw. "And under different circumstances, I would allow you to continue. But a man has just died twenty feet from where we stand, this building will shortly be locked down by the Watch, and I have a first edition that must not be damaged by the inevitable chaos. Good evening, Miss Doukas."

He used the edge of one wing to guide Zeph around the girl and through the service entrance. Sophia did not follow, though Cornelius heard her make a small, frustrated sound as they passed.

The service corridor was blessedly quiet. The stone walls muffled the noise from the Rotunda to a dull murmur. Simple oil lamps hung at regular intervals, casting steady light without the flickering drama of the Rotunda's chandeliers. The floor was plain tile, designed for function rather than beauty.

Zeph sagged against the wall the moment they were out of sight, sliding down until he sat on the floor with his knees drawn up. "That went well."

"You are being sarcastic."

"Very."

Cornelius set his book carefully on a clean section of floor and sat beside it, curling his tail around his feet. "Miss Doukas is frightened and lashing out. Her concern for your well-being is genuine, but it is currently being filtered through anxiety about her family's judgment and the shock of witnessing a death. Do not take her words as her final position."

"She thinks I'm faking." Zeph's voice was hollow. "Or that I'm weak. Either way, it's not great."

"She thinks you are choosing to be unwell, which is ignorant but understandable given her lack of medical expertise." Cornelius tilted his head, studying the boy. "Are you still in pain?"

"Yes. But it's better than it was. Quieter here."

"Can you make it to the street?"

Zeph nodded slowly. "Yeah. Just need a minute."

They sat in silence. From the Rotunda, the sounds of organized panic filtered through—Mayor Barca's voice issuing commands, the heavier footsteps of Watch guards arriving, the high-pitched questions of guests demanding to know what was happening. Cornelius could picture the scene perfectly. Captain Melas would be taking control, establishing order, beginning the tedious process of securing the area and collecting information.

Cornelius had no desire to be part of that process.

"Master Drake?" Zeph spoke without opening his eyes. "Did you see what happened? To Lucchesi?"

"He drank from his glass and collapsed immediately after." Cornelius's claws flexed involuntarily, a physical manifestation of his mind sorting through observed details. "The onset was rapid. Mere seconds between the first sip and the fall."

"Could it have been his heart? Or a stroke?"

"Possible." Cornelius frowned. "Though the timing is suspicious. A man does not typically suffer catastrophic cardiac failure at the precise moment of a ceremonial toast unless there is an underlying cause."

"You mean poison."

"I mean an underlying cause." Cornelius kept his voice neutral. "Which could include poison, yes. Or a previously undiagnosed medical condition. Or simple terrible luck."

"You don't believe in luck."

"No. I believe in patterns, causes, and effects." Cornelius stood and picked up his book, tucking it securely under one arm. "But determining which pattern applies to Signore Lucchesi is not my responsibility. I am a librarian, not an investigator."

Zeph finally opened his eyes. "You're curious though."

"I am always curious. It is my nature." Cornelius spread his wings and used them to help Zeph stand, providing a surprisingly sturdy support for the boy to lean on. "But curiosity does not obligate action. We are going home. You are going to rest. I am going to catalogue my newly signed first edition. Whatever happened to Fabrizio Lucchesi is a matter for the Watch."

"Right." Zeph steadied himself against the wall. "We're not getting involved."

"Exactly." Cornelius guided them toward the far end of the service corridor, where a door marked with the service staff's symbol would lead to a back exit. "We are absolutely, definitively not getting involved."

Even as he said it, Cornelius felt the familiar tug of a problem that needed solving, a mystery that needed categorizing, a pattern waiting to be recognized and recorded. He had felt it when a shipment of supposedly identical manuscripts had arrived with subtle variations in their bindings. He had felt it when three supposedly unrelated donors had each attempted to gift the Library books from the same destroyed private collection.

He felt it now, looking back toward the Grand Rotunda where a man had fallen at the exact moment of triumph.

But Cornelius was disciplined. He was not ruled by impulse. He had his book, his signed first edition of *The Theory of Aether*, authenticated and perfect. That was what he had come for. That was what mattered.

The rest was not his concern.

He pushed open the service door and stepped into the narrow alley behind City Hall. The night air was cooler than the Rotunda's stifling heat, though still warm enough that Cornelius did not need to worry about his book's binding contracting. Zeph followed, moving more steadily now that they were away from the crowds.

"Can you make it to the Library?" Cornelius asked.

"I think so." Zeph leaned against the alley wall, breathing slowly. "The headache's fading. Finally."

"Good." Cornelius adjusted his grip on his book one more time, ensuring the leather was not being stressed. "Then let us depart before Captain Melas decides to seal all the exits and trap us here for the rest of the—"

"Leaving so soon, Master Drake?"

Cornelius's wings snapped tight against his body. He knew that voice. Everyone in Solterra knew that voice.

Captain Theodoros Melas stood at the mouth of the alley, blocking their exit. The Watch captain was a human in his fifties, with iron-gray hair and the kind of weathered face that came from thirty years of dealing with the city's worst impulses. He wore his formal uniform tonight—dark blue wool with silver buttons and the city's seal embroidered on the shoulder—but his expression was pure professional cynicism.

Behind him, two junior guards stood at attention, their hands resting casually on their truncheons.

"Captain." Cornelius kept his voice carefully neutral. "I was unaware the Rotunda had been sealed."

"It hasn't. Yet." Melas stepped into the alley, his boots scraping on the cobblestones. "But it will be in about two minutes. You're lucky I spotted you when I did. Or unlucky, depending on your perspective."

"We were simply—"

"Fleeing the scene of a suspicious death?" Melas's expression did not change. "Yes, I noticed. Care to tell me why?"

Cornelius felt his evening slide from complicated to catastrophic. He glanced at Zeph, who had gone very still, then back at the Captain.

"My intern requires medical attention," Cornelius said carefully. "I was escorting him home."

"Mm." Melas looked at Zeph, his gaze clinical. "You do look terrible, boy. Headache?"

Zeph nodded mutely.

"Right." The Captain's attention returned to Cornelius. "Here's what's going to happen. You're both going to come back inside. You're going to give your statements about what you saw tonight. Then, assuming I don't find anything suspicious in those statements, you can take your intern home and put him to bed. Clear?"

It was not a question. Cornelius recognized the tone of absolute authority, the kind that did not negotiate or compromise.

He sighed. "Perfectly clear, Captain."

"Excellent." Melas stepped aside, gesturing back toward City Hall. "After you, Master Drake. And do try not to fly away. I'm too old to chase dragons tonight."

Cornelius walked back toward the building with as much dignity as he could muster, Zeph trailing behind him and the Watch guards bringing up the rear. His book pressed against his chest, safe and signed and completely irrelevant in the face of what was coming.

His evening, he reflected grimly, had indeed become considerably more complicated.
