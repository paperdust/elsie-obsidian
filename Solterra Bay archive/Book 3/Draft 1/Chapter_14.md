# Chapter 14

The records storage door was locked.

Cornelius had expected as much. City Hall maintained security protocols even during emergencies—perhaps especially during emergencies. He adjusted his spectacles and examined the mechanism with professional interest.

"Can you pick it?" Zeph asked.

"I am a Library Dragon, not a common thief." Cornelius extended one talon toward the bronze plate surrounding the lock. "However, I do possess institutional access credentials that should—"

The door opened from the inside.

Imelda stood in the threshold, her copper-beaded hair catching lamplight. She wore the same formal robes from the gala, now rumpled and ink-stained at the cuffs. Her expression suggested she had been expecting them.

"I wondered when you would arrive," she said.

Cornelius blinked. "You are already here."

"I came to review the publication archives after Captain Melas released me from witness interviews. The official investigation has stalled into procedural documentation. I concluded my time would be better spent conducting actual research." She stepped aside, gesturing them into the antechamber. "I assume you reached similar conclusions."

The space beyond was smaller than Cornelius had anticipated. Not the grand archive room he had envisioned, but a narrow chamber lined with filing cabinets and document boxes. A single work table occupied the center, its surface already covered with open ledgers and loose papers.

Cornelius glided from Zeph's shoulder to the table. His talons clicked against wood worn smooth by decades of bureaucratic labor.

"We have less than one hour before Captain Melas files formal charges against Valerian," he said. "I need access to Lucchesi's publication history. Complete collaboration records. Any documentation of ghostwriting arrangements or disputed authorship."

Imelda moved to one of the filing cabinets, her fingers trailing across labeled drawers. "You have revised your theory."

It was not a question. Cornelius's tail curled.

"My previous theory was catastrophically flawed. I am constructing a new framework based on evidence rather than elegant narrative." He paused. "Zeph observed that the Judgment Salt did not kill Valerian. The lethality difference suggests the compound was judging different levels of guilt for the same category of crime."

"Intellectual theft," Imelda said. She pulled open a drawer marked *Literary Registry—L through M*. "You believe Lucchesi died because he was the primary thief. Valerian survived because his guilt was secondary. Complicit but coerced."

"Yes." Cornelius felt vindication warm his chest. "Which means the killer knew about the theft. Knew the specifics in sufficient detail to calibrate the Salt's judgment parameters. I need to establish who had access to that knowledge."

Imelda withdrew a thick folder and carried it to the table. "Then you need more than publication records. You need stylistic analysis."

"I need what?"

"Literary forensics." She opened the folder, revealing contracts and correspondence in neat chronological arrangement. "The Registry tracks authorship disputes. Copyright challenges. Ghostwriting arrangements when they are disclosed. But the most reliable method for identifying true authorship is not legal documentation. It is prose style."

Cornelius's analytical mind engaged with the concept. "You are suggesting textual analysis as evidence."

"I am suggesting that every writer has a voice. A fingerprint in their sentence structure, their word choice, their emotional register." Imelda pulled one document free—a contract dated five years prior. "Lucchesi's early work is here. His doctoral thesis on Aetheric Resonance Theory. His first three monographs. All written before he became famous."

She arranged them across the table with practiced precision. Then she withdrew a second stack—newer publications bearing Lucchesi's name but marked with small notation symbols in the Registry's hand.

"And these are his later works," she said. "The bestsellers. The books that made him a household name."

Zeph leaned over the table, careful not to disturb the arrangement. "What do the symbols mean?"

"Disputed provenance." Imelda tapped one notation. "Nothing actionable. No formal challenges. But the Registry clerks are trained to notice inconsistency. These books were flagged for stylistic deviation."

"Meaning someone suspected Lucchesi did not actually write them," Cornelius said.

"Meaning someone with trained literary judgment recognized that these books were written by a different hand." Imelda opened the first early monograph. "Look. This is Lucchesi's genuine voice."

Cornelius read the opening paragraph. The prose was dense. Technical. Every sentence constructed with mathematical precision, each clause building on the previous with rigid logical progression. The emotional register was nonexistent—pure academic discourse stripped of personality.

"He writes like a particularly tedious equation," Cornelius observed.

"He writes like a man who values theory over humanity." Imelda closed that volume and opened one of the later bestsellers. "Now look at this."

The difference was immediate. The opening paragraph still discussed Aetheric theory, still maintained scholarly rigor. But the sentences had rhythm. Flow. The technical concepts were anchored to human experience—comparing resonance patterns to heartbeats, describing magical theory through the lens of personal discovery.

It was warm. Accessible. Alive.

"They do not match," Cornelius said.

"They could not possibly match." Imelda's voice held quiet certainty. "These are fundamentally different writers. Different minds. Different souls expressing themselves through language."

Zeph's hand hovered over the bestseller. "So Lucchesi did not write this."

"Lucchesi provided the outline. The theoretical framework. The citations to obscure sources." Imelda turned pages, her copper beads clicking softly. "But someone else transformed that framework into actual prose. Someone who understood how to make theory sing."

"Valerian," Cornelius said.

The pieces assembled themselves with crystalline clarity. Not the forced elegance of his previous theory. Not the narrative satisfaction of certainty. Just logic following evidence to inevitable conclusion.

"Valerian ghostwrote the bestsellers," he continued. "Lucchesi gave him notes and outlines. Valerian produced the manuscripts. And Lucchesi claimed credit for work that was fundamentally, spiritually Valerian's creation."

"Soul theft," Imelda said quietly. "Not merely stealing credit. Stealing voice. Stealing the part of Valerian that lived in those words."

Cornelius's claws scraped against wood. The magnitude of the crime clarified itself. Academic fraud was common enough. Unethical but mundane. But this was different. Lucchesi had not simply plagiarized research. He had taken Valerian's soul—the essence of how Valerian understood and expressed truth—and worn it like stolen clothing.

"The Judgment Salt was calibrated to judge that theft," he said. "Not generic fraud. Specific theft of identity. Of voice. Of the fundamental expression of self."

"Which is why Lucchesi died instantly." Imelda's fingers traced the contract dates. "He knew. At the deepest level, he knew exactly what he had stolen. The guilt was absolute."

"And Valerian survived because his guilt was different." Zeph's voice was soft. "He felt guilty for participating. For letting it happen. For not fighting harder to claim his own work."

"Precisely." Cornelius's tail swished. The theory held weight now. Substance. "The killer knew about the soul theft. Knew enough to weaponize Lucchesi's own guilt. Which means the killer had access to both men's work. The real work and the stolen work."

"The publisher," Zeph said. "The woman in gray with ink stains. Valerian said she visited Lucchesi privately. She would know who actually wrote what."

Cornelius considered this. "Publishers process manuscripts. They would recognize stylistic inconsistency. Would notice if an author's voice changed dramatically between books."

"And they would have documentation." Imelda gestured to the Registry folder. "Correspondence. Editorial notes. Original manuscripts showing revision history."

The logic was sound. Compelling. But something nagged at Cornelius's analytical framework. He could not identify the flaw, which meant—

"But," he said carefully, testing the theory for weakness, "a publisher's primary concern is commercial success. If Lucchesi's books sold well, why would they care about authorship disputes?"

"Money," Zeph offered. "Maybe Lucchesi owed them something. Or they wanted a bigger cut."

"Possible." Cornelius's wings shifted. "Though that suggests greed rather than moral judgment. The Judgment Salt implies the killer believed they were enacting justice. Punishing genuine wrong."

Imelda was quiet. Her gaze moved across the documents with the focused intensity Cornelius recognized from her deepest research states. She was thinking. Processing. Following some thread he could not yet see.

"The Salt required specific knowledge," she said finally. "Not merely knowing that Lucchesi stole Valerian's work. Knowing the exact nature of the crime. The soul theft aspect. The violation of identity and voice."

"Yes."

"That level of understanding suggests intimate familiarity with both men. With their relationship. With the emotional dimension of the theft." Her copper beads clinked as she turned to face them fully. "A publisher would know the commercial fraud. But would they understand the spiritual violation?"

Cornelius's analytical mind caught the distinction. "You are suggesting the killer had personal connection to one or both victims."

"I am suggesting the killer cared. Not about money or credit or even justice in the abstract." Imelda's dark eyes were steady. "They cared about the specific harm done to Valerian. About what was stolen from him. About restoring some form of moral balance."

"So someone who knew Valerian well," Zeph said. "Family? Friend?"

"Valerian is Sphinx-kin." Cornelius recalled the interrogation. "He mentioned no family in Solterra Bay. His relationship with Lucchesi was secret. His professional circle would have been limited to—"

He stopped.

Zeph was rubbing his temple. The gesture was subtle but Cornelius had learned to recognize its significance. The headache returning. The electric sensation that preceded danger or revelation.

"Zeph?" he said carefully.

"I am thinking." Zeph's hand pressed harder against his skull. "About the tribunal. When Valerian drank the water. Right before I knew it was poisoned."

"You experienced precognitive warning."

"Yeah, but it was weird. Different from the other times." Zeph's eyes were unfocused, gaze turned inward. "Usually the headaches feel like pressure. Like something building up behind my eyes. But this one was..."

"Was what?"

"Musical." Zeph's face scrunched with the effort of articulation. "Like someone screaming but the scream had melody. Like the pain had rhythm. Does that make any sense?"

Cornelius's tail went still. "Musical pain."

"I know it sounds insane—"

"No." Cornelius turned to Imelda. "What species produces magical effects through sound? Through melody and rhythm?"

Imelda's expression shifted. Understanding blooming across her weathered features.

"Sirens," she said.

The pieces locked into place. Not with satisfying click of his previous theories. This was slower. More deliberate. Each element confirming the next with patient accumulation of evidence.

"Sirens manipulate perception through song," Cornelius said. The words came faster as logic assembled itself. "Their magic operates through auditory channels. Creates emotional resonance. Influences—"

"Influences guilt," Imelda finished. "A Siren could not create guilt where none existed. But they could amplify existing guilt. Could tune someone's own conscience to specific frequency. Could make that guilt resonate until it became... active."

"The Judgment Salt requires the subject to acknowledge their guilt," Cornelius said. "To believe, fundamentally, that they deserve punishment. A Siren could ensure that belief. Could make certain the guilty party was psychologically prepared for judgment."

Zeph lowered his hand from his temple. "So someone sang at Lucchesi? Made him feel extra guilty so the Salt would work?"

"Not sang. Not audibly." Imelda moved to a different filing cabinet, her movements precise. "Siren magic does not require performative song. The melody operates on frequencies most species cannot consciously perceive. A human would experience it as emotional pressure. A Lamassu-touched youth with developing guardian senses might perceive it as rhythmic pain."

She pulled open a drawer marked *Gala Registry—Witnesses and Attendees*. Her fingers walked through alphabetical dividers with practiced speed.

"We need the attendance roster," she said. "Anyone with Siren heritage would be documented. Registry protocols require species disclosure for—"

"Karellas," Zeph said. "Chloe Karellas. She is a Siren."

Cornelius's wings spread slightly. "You are certain?"

"I sat near her family during the speech. Her mother was wearing those ear cuffs that Sirens use to dampen their own magic in crowds. And Chloe had the webbing. Between her fingers. You can see it when she gestures."

Imelda found the entry. Read it aloud. "Chloe Karellas. Age nineteen. Siren. Student at the Maritime Academy. Daughter of Pavlos and Irene Karellas of House Karellas."

Silence settled over the antechamber. The kind of silence that preceded revelation. The moment when theory crystallized into actionable certainty.

"Why would Chloe Karellas care about Valerian's stolen work?" Zeph asked. "They are not related. Not friends that we know of."

Cornelius considered the question. The logic required additional links. Additional evidence. He was determined not to construct premature narrative this time.

"We need more information," he said. "Chloe's connection to either victim. Her access to Judgment Salt. Her knowledge of—"

"Her relationship with Valerian," Imelda said quietly.

Both Cornelius and Zeph turned to stare at her.

Imelda's expression was distant. Remembering. "Valerian mentioned during interrogation that he had been collecting evidence. Preparing documentation to prove his authorship. He said he needed allies. People who understood literary analysis and could verify the stylistic discrepancy."

"So?" Zeph asked.

"So the Maritime Academy has an excellent literature program. Many students undertake independent study with published authors." Imelda closed the roster. "And Sphinx-kin have natural affinity for truth-seeking professions. Teaching. Mentorship. Particularly with students who show genuine intellectual curiosity."

Cornelius's analytical mind raced ahead. "You are suggesting Valerian mentored Chloe. That they formed academic relationship. That she learned about the theft through—"

"Through helping him document it," Imelda finished. "Through comparing manuscripts. Through witnessing firsthand the evidence of what Lucchesi had stolen. Through understanding exactly what soul theft means to someone like Valerian."

The theory held weight. Substance. But it still required confirmation. Cornelius needed certainty above ninety percent before—

No. He stopped that thought. Adjusted it.

He needed reasonable certainty. Sufficient certainty to act. Not perfect certainty. Not elegant narrative closure. Just enough evidence to justify presenting the theory to Captain Melas and letting proper investigation determine truth.

"We have motive," he said slowly. "Chloe witnessed the soul theft. Understood its magnitude. Developed connection to Valerian through academic mentorship. When Sirens form bonds, those bonds are—"

"Absolute," Imelda said. "Sirens are fiercely protective of chosen family. It is fundamental to their nature. If Chloe accepted Valerian as mentor, as someone under her protection, then his harm would be her harm."

"So she killed Lucchesi to protect Valerian." Zeph's voice was flat. "That is the theory."

"She executed Lucchesi for soul theft using a method that required his own guilt as weapon," Cornelius corrected. "The distinction matters. This was not simple murder. It was judgment."

"Okay, but how did she get the Salt? How did she administer it? How did she know about Judgment Salt at all?" Zeph was pacing now, his footsteps echoing against stone. "And why poison Valerian at the tribunal if she was trying to protect him?"

The questions were valid. Critical. Cornelius's theory had gaps. Large ones.

"We need more evidence," he admitted. "Documentation of Chloe and Valerian's relationship. Proof she had access to alchemical knowledge. Explanation for how she administered the poison and—"

"And we need time we do not have." Zeph stopped pacing. Checked the corridor beyond the antechamber. "How long until Melas files the warrants?"

Imelda consulted a small timepiece from her robes. "Thirty-seven minutes."

Cornelius felt pressure building in his chest. The familiar anxiety of insufficient data colliding with temporal constraint. He needed more time. More evidence. More certainty.

But certainty was luxury. Right now, he had reasonable suspicion and limited window for action.

"We present what we have," he said. The decision felt wrong. Premature. But necessary. "We take the theory to Captain Melas. Explain the logic. Let him investigate properly before filing charges against the wrong suspect."

"He kicked you off the investigation," Zeph pointed out.

"He removed me from official involvement. He said nothing about providing relevant information that emerges from independent research." Cornelius adjusted his spectacles. "Besides, he gave us one hour. We are using that hour to bring him actionable intelligence."

"Intelligence that could be completely wrong," Zeph said. "Like the Valerian theory was wrong."

The words stung. But they were fair.

Cornelius looked at the documents spread across the table. At Imelda's careful analysis. At the evidence of soul theft preserved in prose style and Registry notation. At the logical chain connecting Chloe to motive, means, and magical capability.

It was not ninety percent certain. Perhaps not even eighty percent.

But it was considerably more than hypothesis. It was reasoned analysis supported by evidence and expert testimony.

"We might be wrong," he admitted. "But we are significantly less wrong than when we accused Valerian. And if we are right, Captain Melas is about to file formal charges against an innocent man while the actual killer walks free."

Imelda began gathering the documents. Her movements were efficient, practiced. "I will accompany you. If Melas requires expert testimony regarding stylistic analysis, I can provide it."

"And I can explain the musical headache thing," Zeph added. "Even though it sounds completely insane."

"It sounds like emerging guardian sense interpreting Siren magic," Imelda corrected gently. "Which is precisely the kind of sensory data that matters in cases involving species-specific abilities."

Cornelius spread his wings. Shook himself once. The gesture helped settle his nerves into working order.

"Then we proceed," he said. "Two liabilities and one expert witness. It will have to be sufficient."

Zeph grinned despite the tension. "Pretty sure Imelda does not count as a liability."

"I have been working with Cornelius for forty-three years," Imelda said, a hint of warmth entering her voice. "I am absolutely a liability. Just a different category."

She tucked the documents into a leather satchel and moved toward the corridor. Cornelius glided to Zeph's shoulder, settling into the familiar perch. His weight distributed properly. His talons gripped without piercing fabric.

They had thirty-seven minutes to convince Captain Melas that his political solution was wrong. That the real killer was not Valerian but a nineteen-year-old Siren student acting as executioner on behalf of a stolen soul.

Thirty-seven minutes to prevent one injustice and potentially expose another.

It would have to be enough.
