# Chapter 1

"You are certain the vintage is authentic?"

Cornelius Drake adjusted his spectacles with one bronze claw and squinted at the leather binding cradled in his other forearm. The first edition of *The Theory of Aether* deserved better than the crush of bodies currently threatening its existence. He tucked the volume closer to his chest, shielding it from the chaos of the Grand Rotunda.

The Mayor's assistant—a nervous human woman with ink stains on her fingers—nodded so hard her elaborate hairpins rattled. "Yes, Master Drake. Signore Lucchesi confirmed the book's provenance himself. He is quite eager to sign it for you."

"Eager." Cornelius allowed himself a small sniff of satisfaction. "As he should be."

The woman's smile wavered. She clearly wanted to escape. Cornelius permitted it with a slight incline of his head, and she fled toward the refreshment tables with unseemly haste.

Humans. Always in such a hurry to be elsewhere.

Cornelius spread his wings—each a careful three feet from tip to tip—and glided from the marble pedestal where he had been holding court to a more defensible position near the eastern colonnade. The motion drew stares, as it always did. He ignored them with the practiced ease of one hundred and twenty-seven years of being exceptional.

The Grand Rotunda of City Hall was, he had to admit, an acceptable venue for the Solterra Annual Gala, even if the event itself was a tedious exercise in social obligation. The space rose three stories, crowned by a dome painted with scenes of maritime commerce and mythological allegory. The floor was a geometric marvel of white marble and black basalt, arranged in patterns that pleased his sense of order. Columns ringed the space, their capitals carved with acanthus leaves and the symbols of the three Tile Families: the wave of House Kallistos, the flame of House Doukas, the geometric precision of House Veneti.

But the architecture could not compensate for the people.

They filled the Rotunda like a plague of well-dressed locusts, their voices echoing off the stone in a cacophony that set his teeth on edge. Silk rustled. Jewelry clinked. Somewhere, a satyr bellowed laughter that made Cornelius's ear-slits flatten against his skull.

He pressed himself against a column's cool surface and tried to calculate the fastest route to Fabrizio Lucchesi's signing table.

The author stood on a raised dais at the far end of the Rotunda, surrounded by admirers like a particularly verbose spider in a web of fawning flies. Lucchesi was tall for a human, with an elaborate mustache and the sort of flowing silk cravat that suggested a man who took himself very seriously indeed. He gestured broadly as he spoke, his rings catching the light from the oil lamps suspended overhead.

Cornelius's claws tightened on his book. All he needed was two minutes of the man's time. A signature. Perhaps a brief exchange of intellectual pleasantries. Then he could return to the Library, to the blessed silence of the stacks, to the cool darkness where books stayed precisely where one placed them and did not speak unless opened.

"Cornelius!"

He turned his head with deliberate slowness. The voice belonged to Cassius Nerva, the satyr-kin baker whose shop occupied the street three flights below the Library. Cassius waved from across the Rotunda, his curling horns adorned with small brass bells that chimed as he moved.

Cornelius pretended not to see him. It was not personal—Cassius made an acceptable mint tea and kept his ovens appropriately clean—but Cornelius had no intention of being drawn into conversation. Not when freedom was so close.

He tucked his wings tight against his body and slipped between two conversing couples, his small size finally an advantage. The trick to navigating human crowds, he had learned, was to move with purpose. Humans expected dragons to take up space, to demand attention. By staying low and quick, he could pass almost unnoticed.

Almost.

"Is that the Library Dragon?"

"Oh, how darling! Look at his little spectacles!"

Cornelius suppressed a hiss. He was not *darling*. He was a manifestation of pure knowledge, a guardian of civilization's collected wisdom, a creature of—

"Excuse me." A hand reached toward him. "May I pet you?"

"You may *not*." Cornelius bared his teeth—small, sharp, and numerous—in what was most definitely not a smile. "I am neither a cat nor a curiosity. I am consulting on a matter of extreme bibliographic importance, and if you value the structural integrity of your fingers, you will remove them from my personal space immediately."

The hand retreated. Its owner, a young elf woman in a gown that cost more than the Library's annual budget, looked appropriately mortified.

Cornelius continued his advance.

The signing table loomed closer. Fifteen feet. Ten. He could see the stack of Lucchesi's latest novel on the corner of the table, the covers garish with gilt lettering. *The Merchant's Gambit*. Trashy commercial fiction, but the man's earlier theoretical work had been groundbreaking. That was what mattered. That was what made this intolerable evening worthwhile.

"Master Drake!"

This voice, at least, was familiar. Cornelius paused and glanced up.

Zephyr Taraki threaded through the crowd with the graceless urgency of a sixteen-year-old who had grown three inches in the past month and had not yet adjusted to his new center of gravity. His intern. His responsibility, however temporary. And, judging by the boy's expression, his current problem.

Zeph's dark skin had gone gray at the edges, the way it did when the boy was about to be sick. His black hair—which gleamed with an odd bronze sheen in certain lights, though Zeph always dismissed this as "the oil I use"—stuck up at wild angles, as if he had been running his hands through it repeatedly. He wore his best tunic, the dark green one without any stains, and had even attempted to tame his collar.

He looked miserable.

"Boy." Cornelius kept his voice low. "You appear to be approximately thirty seconds from vomiting on a city official. Please tell me you have not been sampling the wine."

"I'm sixteen." Zeph's voice cracked halfway through the sentence. He winced. "I'm not drinking. I just... my head. The noise. It's so loud."

Cornelius tilted his head, studying the boy with the clinical detachment he usually reserved for damaged manuscripts. Zeph's pupils were dilated. His pulse—visible in the vein at his throat—was elevated. His breathing was shallow. Classic symptoms of a panic response, or possibly a migraine.

"Did you take the willow bark extract I provided?"

"Two doses." Zeph swallowed hard. "It's not helping. Maybe I should just go home. Tell Sophia I'm sorry. Tell her family—"

"You will do no such thing." Cornelius shifted his book to his other arm and used his tail to nudge Zeph toward a slightly less crowded corner. "You have been preparing for this social engagement for three weeks. You have memorized the names and business interests of Sophia Doukas's entire extended family. You have bathed. You have dressed. You are not retreating now because of a headache."

"Easy for you to say." Zeph leaned against the column, closing his eyes. "You don't have to meet your girlfriend's terrifying relatives while your brain tries to escape through your eye sockets."

"I do not have a girlfriend because I have sense." Cornelius peered at the boy more carefully. There was something odd about Zeph's scent tonight. Normally, the boy smelled of cheap soap, the particular mustiness of old paper, and whatever he had eaten for lunch. Tonight, there was an undercurrent of something sharper. Ozone, perhaps. The smell of a storm that had not yet broken.

Strange.

"Where is Miss Doukas currently?" Cornelius asked.

Zeph gestured vaguely toward the southern end of the Rotunda without opening his eyes. "Over there. With her mom. I'm supposed to join them in five minutes for the formal introduction thing, but I don't think I can—"

"You can." Cornelius made his voice firm. "Breathe. Focus on a fixed point. Allow your equilibrium to stabilize."

"I'm not gonna stabilize. I'm gonna throw up on the Matriarch of House Doukas and then Sophia will never speak to me again and I'll have to change my name and move to the coast and—"

"Zephyr." Cornelius waited until the boy opened one eye. "The human body is a remarkably resilient instrument. You are experiencing a stress response. It will pass. In the meantime, you will smile, you will bow at the appropriate depth, and you will make the entirely accurate observation that the Doukas family mosaics are the finest examples of modern geometric tile-work in the entire bay."

Zeph managed a weak smile. "You wrote that line for me."

"Because it is true. And because you require all the assistance you can acquire." Cornelius adjusted his spectacles again. "Now. I am going to obtain Signore Lucchesi's signature. You are going to remain here, practice your breathing exercises, and prepare to dazzle your beloved's family with your impeccable manners and sudden knowledge of decorative arts. Are we in agreement?"

"Yeah. Sure." Zeph slid down the column until he was sitting on the floor, knees drawn up. "Good luck with the signature."

"Luck is for the unprepared." Cornelius sniffed. "I am merely collecting what I am owed."

He left Zeph there and resumed his approach to the signing table. Three more steps. Two. One.

And then the crowd shifted.

A wave of silk-clad bodies surged around Lucchesi's table, all of them angling for the author's attention. Cornelius found himself trapped behind a wall of perfumed fabric and gesticulating hands. He craned his neck, trying to see over—or through—the obstacle, but it was useless. He was twelve pounds of dragon in a sea of enthusiastic humanity.

This would not stand.

Cornelius spread his wings, calculated the angle, and launched himself upward in a single powerful stroke. He caught the air, rose above the crowd, and landed with precise grace on the edge of Lucchesi's signing table.

The conversations around him stopped.

Lucchesi himself blinked, his pen frozen halfway to a book. Up close, the author was less impressive than his reputation suggested. His mustache was waxed to sharp points, and his cologne was aggressively floral. His eyes—a watery blue—fixed on Cornelius with an expression that hovered between delight and alarm.

"Ah," Lucchesi said, recovering quickly. His accent was thick, rolling vowels in the Valdesian style. "The famous Library Dragon. Master Drake, yes? I have heard much of you."

"Have you." Cornelius placed his own book on the table between them, positioning it with care. "Then you will understand why I have come."

Lucchesi glanced at the book. Something flickered across his face—too quick for Cornelius to identify—before the smile returned. "A first edition. How marvelous. You wish for me to sign it?"

"I do."

"But of course! It would be my honor." Lucchesi reached for the book.

Cornelius placed one claw on the cover. "Carefully."

The author's smile tightened, but he nodded. He opened to the title page with adequate respect, though Cornelius noted the man's hands were not as steady as one would expect from someone who made his living with a pen. Nerves, perhaps. Or wine.

Lucchesi uncapped his fountain pen—mother of pearl, ostentatious—and paused. "Should I inscribe it to you personally?"

"That will be acceptable."

The pen touched paper. Ink flowed. Cornelius watched with the intensity of a raptor observing prey, ensuring that each letter formed correctly, that no drops fell, that the signature itself matched the authenticated samples he had reviewed in preparation for this moment.

*To Cornelius Drake, a fellow scholar of the mysteries. With admiration, Fabrizio Lucchesi.*

The author blotted the signature, closed the book, and slid it back across the table.

"There. I hope it pleases you."

Cornelius inspected the inscription. The handwriting was adequate if somewhat florid. The ink was archival quality. The spelling was correct. He nodded once. "It is acceptable."

"High praise from a dragon." Lucchesi's smile warmed slightly, becoming almost genuine. "Tell me, do you plan to stay for my speech? I will be discussing the relationship between aetheric theory and narrative structure. It should interest you."

Cornelius had already tucked his book securely under one arm. "I had not intended—"

"Oh, but you must!" Lucchesi gestured broadly, nearly knocking over his inkwell. "A mind such as yours would appreciate the nuances. In fact, I insist. I will mention you by name. 'Even the esteemed Master Drake has honored us with his presence!' How would that be?"

Trapped. Cornelius felt the jaws of social obligation closing around him like a snare. If he refused now, he would appear rude. If he appeared rude, there would be talk. If there was talk, Imelda would hear of it. If Imelda heard of it, she would give him that look. The one that suggested profound disappointment without a single word.

"I suppose I could remain for a short while," Cornelius said, each word extracted like a tooth.

"Excellent!" Lucchesi beamed. "The speech begins in ten minutes. I promise not to bore you."

Cornelius very much doubted that, but he had made his choice. He gathered his book, spread his wings, and glided back down into the crowd.

The Rotunda had grown more crowded in his absence, if such a thing were possible. Servers in white tunics circulated with trays of wine and small savory pastries that left grease stains on fingers. A string quartet had set up near the eastern colonnade and was attempting something complicated by Veraldi, though the cellist kept speeding up at the cadences.

Cornelius retreated to his previous position by the column where he had left Zeph, only to find the boy missing. A scan of the room revealed him standing stiffly near a cluster of well-dressed humans who could only be the Doukas family. Sophia stood at the center, radiant in pale blue silk that complemented her dark hair. Her hand rested on Zeph's arm, but the boy looked like he was facing an execution rather than a social introduction.

As Cornelius watched, Zeph's face went from gray to nearly green. The boy said something, bowed with desperate formality, and fled toward the corridor that led to the washrooms.

Sophia watched him go, her expression unreadable.

Cornelius sighed. Young humans and their complicated emotional entanglements. He would have to speak with the boy later about managing his physical responses to stress. One could not be a successful scholar—or a successful anything—if one's body betrayed one at every moment of pressure.

A bell chimed. The conversations around the Rotunda quieted.

Mayor Tanit Barca stepped onto a small platform near the center of the room. She was an imposing woman, an orc with the kind of presence that commanded attention without effort. Her formal robes were embroidered with the seal of Solterra Bay, and her tusks had been decorated with silver caps for the occasion.

"Honored guests," she began, her voice carrying easily across the space. "Welcome to the Annual Solterra Gala. We gather tonight to celebrate not only our prosperity but also the arts and sciences that make our city a beacon of culture in these uncertain times."

Cornelius tuned out the speech. He had heard variations of it every year for the past three decades. The Mayor always praised the Tile Families. She always mentioned the importance of tradition and innovation in equal measure. She always expressed hope for the future while honoring the past.

It was boring, predictable, and entirely unnecessary.

He looked down at his book, running one claw gently along the spine. The leather was cool under his touch, worn smooth by a century of careful hands. Inside were theories that had changed the way scholars understood the fundamental nature of reality. Lucchesi had been young when he wrote this, barely thirty, but already brilliant.

The later works had been... less impressive. More commercial. Cornelius suspected the man had sold out, chasing popular acclaim rather than truth. But this book, this first edition, represented something pure. Knowledge for its own sake.

That was what mattered.

The Mayor concluded her remarks to polite applause and introduced Lucchesi with the kind of effusive praise that made Cornelius's scales itch. The author mounted the platform, bowing to the crowd with theatrical grace.

"My friends," Lucchesi began, spreading his arms wide. "Tonight, we celebrate the power of stories. Not merely to entertain, but to reveal. To transform. To connect us to truths that lie beyond the mundane!"

Cornelius settled in for what would undoubtedly be a long night.

The speech was, as predicted, largely empty rhetoric dressed up in flowery language. Lucchesi spoke of "the marriage of art and science," of "the aetheric resonance in narrative structure," and other phrases that sounded profound without actually meaning anything specific. 

Around the Rotunda, guests nodded and murmured appreciation. Cornelius remained still, his focus divided between the speech and the exits. The moment this performance concluded, he would make his escape. Imelda could not accuse him of rudeness if he had stayed for the entire—

Zeph stumbled back into the Rotunda, looking marginally less green but no happier. The boy spotted Cornelius and made his way over, moving carefully through the crowd as if any sudden motion might shatter him.

"How did it go?" Cornelius whispered.

"Her mom asked me about my career prospects." Zeph leaned against the column and closed his eyes again. "I said I was a library intern. She asked what my 'real' plans were. I said I hadn't decided. Then my head exploded and I had to run away."

"Metaphorically exploded."

"Feels pretty literal right now."

Cornelius frowned. The boy's distress seemed disproportionate to a simple headache, even a severe one. "Perhaps you should see a healer."

"After. Can't leave now. Sophia would..." Zeph trailed off, grimacing. "I'll be fine. How much longer?"

"He is beginning his conclusion." Cornelius gestured toward the platform with his tail. "Five minutes at most."

They waited in silence, or as close to silence as the crowded Rotunda allowed. Lucchesi built toward his finale, his voice rising with practiced emotion. Servants began circulating with trays of wine glasses, preparing for the traditional toast.

"And so," Lucchesi declared, accepting a glass from a nearby server, "I invite you all to raise your glasses. To Solterra Bay! To art! To science! To the beautiful marriage of both!"

The crowd reached for glasses. Cornelius, lacking both hands and interest, remained where he was. Beside him, Zeph tensed.

"You alright?" Cornelius asked quietly.

"Yeah. Just... the noise. Everyone moving at once. It's—" Zeph pressed his palms against his temples. "It's really loud."

Lucchesi raised his glass high. The light from the hanging lamps caught the wine, turning it deep red. "To truth!" he proclaimed.

"To truth!" the crowd echoed.

Cornelius watched with detached interest as Lucchesi brought the glass to his lips. The author drank deeply, his throat working.

Then stopped.

Lucchesi's eyes widened. His free hand went to his collar, clawing at the silk. The wine glass slipped from his fingers and shattered on the platform, red liquid spreading across white marble like blood.

The author tried to speak. Only a choked gasp emerged.

Then Fabrizio Lucchesi fell.

The crowd's cheer died. For one long, impossible moment, the Rotunda was silent except for the faint tinkling of the last shards of glass settling.

Then someone screamed.

Cornelius's claws tightened on his book as chaos erupted around him. His evening, he realized with profound irritation, had just become considerably more complicated.

---

# Chapter 2

# Chapter 2

The scream cut through the Rotunda like a blade through parchment.

Cornelius's first instinct was to protect his book. He wrapped both forearms around the leather binding and pressed it against his chest, wings half-spread to shield it from the surge of bodies that would inevitably follow panic. A crowd in chaos had no respect for rare manuscripts.

His second instinct was to curse his own curiosity for keeping him here.

The Grand Rotunda transformed in the space of three heartbeats. The elegant assembly of Solterra's finest citizens became a writhing mass of silk and terror. Someone knocked over a serving tray. Crystal shattered. Wine spread across the geometric marble floor in branching rivulets that reminded Cornelius unpleasantly of arterial patterns.

On the platform, Fabrizio Lucchesi lay motionless.

The author had fallen on his side, one arm flung out as if reaching for something just beyond his grasp. His elaborate cravat had come undone during his collapse, the silk pooling beneath his cheek. From this distance, Cornelius could not tell if the man's chest still moved. The spilled wine from Lucchesi's glass had spread around his head like a dark halo.

"Someone fetch a healer!" Mayor Barca's voice boomed across the chaos. The orc stood at the edge of the platform, her formal robes billowing as she gestured sharply at her attendants. "Now! And clear this space!"

No one cleared. If anything, the crowd pressed closer, everyone craning for a better view of the fallen celebrity. Cornelius recognized the pattern. He had seen it before at public lectures when a visiting scholar fainted from the heat—humans possessed a morbid fascination with witnessing disaster firsthand.

"Master Drake." Zeph's voice came from somewhere below Cornelius's perch by the column. "Master Drake, I think I need to—"

The boy's words cut off. Cornelius looked down sharply.

Zeph had gone white. Not the grayish pallor from earlier, but a true bloodless white that made his dark skin look waxen. He had pressed himself against the column as if it were the only thing keeping him upright. Both hands clutched his head. His eyes were squeezed shut, and his jaw was clenched so tightly that Cornelius could see the muscle jumping in his cheek.

"Zephyr." Cornelius adjusted his grip on his book and climbed down the column with careful precision, using his claws to find purchase in the carved acanthus leaves. "Look at me."

The boy did not respond. His breathing had gone rapid and shallow.

Cornelius reached the floor and moved to Zeph's side, positioning himself between the boy and the churning crowd. Up close, he could see that Zeph was trembling. A fine sheen of perspiration covered his forehead despite the cool temperature of the Rotunda.

And there—that scent again. Sharper now. Like the air before lightning struck.

"Breathe," Cornelius ordered, pitching his voice to cut through whatever internal storm the boy was experiencing. "Slowly. Count to four on the inhale."

Zeph managed a shaky breath. Then another. Some of the tension in his shoulders eased, though his hands remained pressed to his temples.

"Better?" Cornelius asked.

"No." Zeph's voice was barely a whisper. "Everything's too loud. Too bright. I can feel people moving and it's like—like they're all scraping against my skin at once."

An unusual description. Cornelius filed it away for later analysis. "Can you stand without support?"

"I think so."

"Can you walk?"

"Maybe. Why?"

"Because we are leaving." Cornelius glanced back at the platform, where Mayor Barca and two of her attendants had formed a barrier around Lucchesi's body. A woman in healer's robes was pushing through the crowd, her bag clutched in both hands. "This is no longer our concern."

"But Sophia—"

"Will understand that you are unwell." Cornelius nudged Zeph's leg with his tail. "You can barely remain conscious. You are in no state to provide comfort or support to anyone, least of all yourself. We are extracting you from this situation before you collapse and I have to explain to Imelda why I allowed my intern to crack his skull on historic marble."

Zeph opened his eyes to slits. "You're worried about the marble?"

"I am worried about the paperwork." Cornelius spread one wing and used it to block an overly curious guest who had drifted too close to their position. "And about you, in that order. Now move. Slowly. Use the column for balance if needed."

The boy pushed away from the stone and took one careful step. Then another. Cornelius stayed close, ready to intervene if Zeph's legs gave out. They made slow progress toward the eastern colonnade, away from the platform and the press of bodies.

Behind them, the healer reached Lucchesi's side. Cornelius risked a glance back.

The woman knelt by the fallen author, her hands already glowing with the soft amber light of diagnostic magic. She touched Lucchesi's throat, his wrist, his chest. Her expression, initially focused and professional, went carefully blank.

Cornelius knew that look. He had seen it on the face of the healer who had attended to the previous Head Archivist during the man's final illness. It was the expression of someone delivering bad news they had delivered too many times before.

The healer stood and spoke quietly to Mayor Barca. The Mayor's face, visible even from this distance, hardened into a mask of controlled fury.

Dead, then. Lucchesi was dead.

Cornelius felt a small, cold weight settle in his chest. He had not particularly liked the man—the later novels had been insufferable, and the speech tonight had confirmed Cornelius's suspicion that Lucchesi's serious scholarly days were long behind him. But the author had signed Cornelius's book. Had called him a fellow scholar. Had written *The Theory of Aether*, which had shaped an entire generation's understanding of fundamental magical principles.

And now he was gone, collapsed in the middle of a toast, in front of half of Solterra's elite.

"Master Drake?" Zeph had stopped walking. He leaned heavily against one of the colonnade's pillars, his eyes still closed. "Is he...?"

"I believe so." Cornelius scanned the crowd, looking for the fastest route to the exit. Most of the guests had their backs turned, their attention fixed on the platform. A few were already whispering to each other, their faces alight with the particular animation that came from being present at a scandal. "Which makes it even more imperative that we depart before the Watch arrives and seals the building for questioning."

"They'd do that?"

"A prominent citizen has died suddenly at a public event. Captain Melas will treat this as suspicious until proven otherwise." Cornelius adjusted his spectacles, thinking. "He will want statements from everyone present. That process could take hours."

Zeph swallowed hard. "I can't do hours. I can barely do minutes."

"Precisely." Cornelius's gaze caught on a service entrance partially hidden behind a tall arrangement of hothouse flowers. "This way. Quickly."

They moved as fast as Zeph's condition allowed, which was not particularly fast. Cornelius kept his book tucked close and his senses alert. The last thing he needed was for someone to notice them leaving and decide that fleeing the scene looked suspicious.

They were three feet from the service entrance when a familiar figure stepped into their path.

Sophia Doukas had clearly been crying, though she had composed herself with admirable speed. Her eyes were red-rimmed, and she clutched a lace handkerchief in one hand. She looked at Zeph with an expression that managed to combine concern, frustration, and something that might have been disappointment.

"Zephyr." Her voice was soft but firm. "Where are you going?"

"I—" Zeph wavered on his feet. "I'm not feeling well. I was going to—"

"Run away again?" Sophia's tone did not quite qualify as sharp, but it was close. "Like you did from my mother?"

Cornelius felt his scales prickle with irritation. He did not have time for young human romantic drama, and Zeph certainly was not in a state to navigate it. He stepped forward, positioning himself between the two teenagers.

"Miss Doukas." He kept his voice polite but unyielding. "Zephyr has been suffering from an acute medical condition for the past hour. He requires rest and quiet, neither of which are available in this environment. I am escorting him home."

Sophia's gaze dropped to Cornelius, then back to Zeph. "He can't even speak for himself?"

"I can speak," Zeph managed. "I just... Sophia, I tried. I really tried with your mom, but my head—"

"Always your head." Sophia's fingers tightened on her handkerchief. "It's always something, isn't it? Whenever something important happens, you have a headache, or you're tired, or you're overwhelmed. Do you know how that looks to my family?"

Cornelius's tail lashed once, a sharp movement that drew Sophia's attention immediately.

"Miss Doukas," he said, his voice dropping into the register he reserved for particularly difficult research assistants who needed correction. "Your concern for appearances is noted. However, Zephyr's physical distress is quite real, and I have neither the time nor the patience to debate its legitimacy. We are leaving. You may speak with him tomorrow when he is capable of coherent conversation."

Sophia's cheeks flushed. "I wasn't—"

"You were." Cornelius adjusted his spectacles with one claw. "And under different circumstances, I would allow you to continue. But a man has just died twenty feet from where we stand, this building will shortly be locked down by the Watch, and I have a first edition that must not be damaged by the inevitable chaos. Good evening, Miss Doukas."

He used the edge of one wing to guide Zeph around the girl and through the service entrance. Sophia did not follow, though Cornelius heard her make a small, frustrated sound as they passed.

The service corridor was blessedly quiet. The stone walls muffled the noise from the Rotunda to a dull murmur. Simple oil lamps hung at regular intervals, casting steady light without the flickering drama of the Rotunda's chandeliers. The floor was plain tile, designed for function rather than beauty.

Zeph sagged against the wall the moment they were out of sight, sliding down until he sat on the floor with his knees drawn up. "That went well."

"You are being sarcastic."

"Very."

Cornelius set his book carefully on a clean section of floor and sat beside it, curling his tail around his feet. "Miss Doukas is frightened and lashing out. Her concern for your well-being is genuine, but it is currently being filtered through anxiety about her family's judgment and the shock of witnessing a death. Do not take her words as her final position."

"She thinks I'm faking." Zeph's voice was hollow. "Or that I'm weak. Either way, it's not great."

"She thinks you are choosing to be unwell, which is ignorant but understandable given her lack of medical expertise." Cornelius tilted his head, studying the boy. "Are you still in pain?"

"Yes. But it's better than it was. Quieter here."

"Can you make it to the street?"

Zeph nodded slowly. "Yeah. Just need a minute."

They sat in silence. From the Rotunda, the sounds of organized panic filtered through—Mayor Barca's voice issuing commands, the heavier footsteps of Watch guards arriving, the high-pitched questions of guests demanding to know what was happening. Cornelius could picture the scene perfectly. Captain Melas would be taking control, establishing order, beginning the tedious process of securing the area and collecting information.

Cornelius had no desire to be part of that process.

"Master Drake?" Zeph spoke without opening his eyes. "Did you see what happened? To Lucchesi?"

"He drank from his glass and collapsed immediately after." Cornelius's claws flexed involuntarily, a physical manifestation of his mind sorting through observed details. "The onset was rapid. Mere seconds between the first sip and the fall."

"Could it have been his heart? Or a stroke?"

"Possible." Cornelius frowned. "Though the timing is suspicious. A man does not typically suffer catastrophic cardiac failure at the precise moment of a ceremonial toast unless there is an underlying cause."

"You mean poison."

"I mean an underlying cause." Cornelius kept his voice neutral. "Which could include poison, yes. Or a previously undiagnosed medical condition. Or simple terrible luck."

"You don't believe in luck."

"No. I believe in patterns, causes, and effects." Cornelius stood and picked up his book, tucking it securely under one arm. "But determining which pattern applies to Signore Lucchesi is not my responsibility. I am a librarian, not an investigator."

Zeph finally opened his eyes. "You're curious though."

"I am always curious. It is my nature." Cornelius spread his wings and used them to help Zeph stand, providing a surprisingly sturdy support for the boy to lean on. "But curiosity does not obligate action. We are going home. You are going to rest. I am going to catalogue my newly signed first edition. Whatever happened to Fabrizio Lucchesi is a matter for the Watch."

"Right." Zeph steadied himself against the wall. "We're not getting involved."

"Exactly." Cornelius guided them toward the far end of the service corridor, where a door marked with the service staff's symbol would lead to a back exit. "We are absolutely, definitively not getting involved."

Even as he said it, Cornelius felt the familiar tug of a problem that needed solving, a mystery that needed categorizing, a pattern waiting to be recognized and recorded. He had felt it when a shipment of supposedly identical manuscripts had arrived with subtle variations in their bindings. He had felt it when three supposedly unrelated donors had each attempted to gift the Library books from the same destroyed private collection.

He felt it now, looking back toward the Grand Rotunda where a man had fallen at the exact moment of triumph.

But Cornelius was disciplined. He was not ruled by impulse. He had his book, his signed first edition of *The Theory of Aether*, authenticated and perfect. That was what he had come for. That was what mattered.

The rest was not his concern.

He pushed open the service door and stepped into the narrow alley behind City Hall. The night air was cooler than the Rotunda's stifling heat, though still warm enough that Cornelius did not need to worry about his book's binding contracting. Zeph followed, moving more steadily now that they were away from the crowds.

"Can you make it to the Library?" Cornelius asked.

"I think so." Zeph leaned against the alley wall, breathing slowly. "The headache's fading. Finally."

"Good." Cornelius adjusted his grip on his book one more time, ensuring the leather was not being stressed. "Then let us depart before Captain Melas decides to seal all the exits and trap us here for the rest of the—"

"Leaving so soon, Master Drake?"

Cornelius's wings snapped tight against his body. He knew that voice. Everyone in Solterra knew that voice.

Captain Theodoros Melas stood at the mouth of the alley, blocking their exit. The Watch captain was a human in his fifties, with iron-gray hair and the kind of weathered face that came from thirty years of dealing with the city's worst impulses. He wore his formal uniform tonight—dark blue wool with silver buttons and the city's seal embroidered on the shoulder—but his expression was pure professional cynicism.

Behind him, two junior guards stood at attention, their hands resting casually on their truncheons.

"Captain." Cornelius kept his voice carefully neutral. "I was unaware the Rotunda had been sealed."

"It hasn't. Yet." Melas stepped into the alley, his boots scraping on the cobblestones. "But it will be in about two minutes. You're lucky I spotted you when I did. Or unlucky, depending on your perspective."

"We were simply—"

"Fleeing the scene of a suspicious death?" Melas's expression did not change. "Yes, I noticed. Care to tell me why?"

Cornelius felt his evening slide from complicated to catastrophic. He glanced at Zeph, who had gone very still, then back at the Captain.

"My intern requires medical attention," Cornelius said carefully. "I was escorting him home."

"Mm." Melas looked at Zeph, his gaze clinical. "You do look terrible, boy. Headache?"

Zeph nodded mutely.

"Right." The Captain's attention returned to Cornelius. "Here's what's going to happen. You're both going to come back inside. You're going to give your statements about what you saw tonight. Then, assuming I don't find anything suspicious in those statements, you can take your intern home and put him to bed. Clear?"

It was not a question. Cornelius recognized the tone of absolute authority, the kind that did not negotiate or compromise.

He sighed. "Perfectly clear, Captain."

"Excellent." Melas stepped aside, gesturing back toward City Hall. "After you, Master Drake. And do try not to fly away. I'm too old to chase dragons tonight."

Cornelius walked back toward the building with as much dignity as he could muster, Zeph trailing behind him and the Watch guards bringing up the rear. His book pressed against his chest, safe and signed and completely irrelevant in the face of what was coming.

His evening, he reflected grimly, had indeed become considerably more complicated.

# Chapter 3

# Chapter 3

The Grand Rotunda had descended into barely controlled pandemonium.

Cornelius stood in the service corridor doorway, his book pressed firmly against his chest, and watched as Captain Melas strode into the center of the chaos like a man wading into a tide. The Watch captain raised one hand, and his voice cut through the noise with the authority of someone who had spent three decades shouting orders at people who did not wish to hear them.

"Nobody leaves this building!"

The effect was immediate. Conversations stopped mid-word. A woman near the refreshment tables froze with a wine glass halfway to her lips. Even the string quartet—who had been attempting to pack their instruments in a corner—went still.

Melas gestured sharply to his guards. "Bar the main doors. Post someone at every exit, including the service entrances. If it opens to the street, I want a body in front of it."

Two guards moved immediately toward the Rotunda's grand entrance, a set of bronze-fitted doors that normally stood open to welcome the city's elite. They swung the heavy panels closed with a boom that echoed off the dome overhead. A thick bar—kept in brackets for exactly this purpose—was lifted into place.

The sound of wood settling into iron was unmistakable. Final.

Cornelius's tail twitched. He was trapped. They were all trapped, sealed inside City Hall like specimens in a jar.

He should have felt outraged. Inconvenienced at minimum. He had his book. He had his signed inscription. His evening's objective had been achieved, and now he was being detained by civic bureaucracy and a corpse that was, frankly, no longer his concern.

Instead, Cornelius felt a small, traitorous spark of satisfaction.

If someone had poisoned Fabrizio Lucchesi—and the timing certainly suggested poison—then the killer was now contained within these walls. No escape. No opportunity to dispose of evidence or flee to a convenient alibi. Captain Melas had just created a perfect closed system, all variables accounted for, all elements catalogued and controlled.

It was, Cornelius had to admit, exactly what he would have done.

"This is an outrage!" A man in elaborate silk robes pushed forward from the crowd. Cornelius recognized him as one of the minor shipping merchants, someone who donated to the Library annually in exchange for having his name on a small plaque. "You cannot hold us prisoner! We have done nothing wrong!"

"Nobody said you did anything wrong." Melas's tone suggested he was already exhausted and the night had barely begun. "But a man is dead. Until I know why and how, nobody goes anywhere. Those are the rules."

"What rules?" The merchant's face had gone red. "Show me the statute that allows you to—"

"Maritime Commerce Act, Section Twelve, Subsection Four." Cornelius's voice carried clearly from the doorway. "In cases of suspicious death on civic property, the ranking Watch officer may secure the premises and detain witnesses for a period not to exceed six hours without formal charges. It has been city law since the harbormaster's poisoning of 1847."

Every head in the Rotunda turned toward him.

Cornelius adjusted his spectacles with one claw, his expression carefully neutral. "I believe you will find the Captain is operating well within his legal authority."

The merchant's mouth opened and closed without sound. Melas's gaze found Cornelius across the crowd, and something that might have been grim amusement flickered across the Watch captain's weathered face.

"Thank you, Master Drake." Melas's tone was dry. "I appreciate the legal expertise."

"I contain multitudes of legal expertise." Cornelius remained in the doorway, wings folded tight against his sides. "The Library maintains complete archives of Solterra's civic codes. I have read them all. Twice."

"Of course you have." Melas turned back to the crowd, raising his voice. "Here is what happens next. My guards will take your names and your positions in the room at the time of Signore Lucchesi's collapse. This will be orderly. This will be efficient. The faster you cooperate, the faster you go home. Clear?"

Murmurs rippled through the assembled guests, but the protests had lost their edge. People began organizing themselves into rough groups, clustering by family or business association. The panic was fading, replaced by the resigned irritation of the wealthy forced to endure minor inconvenience.

Cornelius watched the transformation with clinical interest. Humans were herd animals at their core. Give them clear instructions and the appearance of authority, and they would usually comply. It was one of their more useful traits.

"Master Drake." Melas had crossed the Rotunda while Cornelius was observing the crowd. The Watch captain stood just outside the service corridor, his expression carefully controlled. "A word, if you please."

Cornelius glanced at Zeph, who had settled on the floor of the corridor with his back against the wall and his eyes closed. The boy's color had improved slightly, though he still looked like something recently retrieved from the bottom of a harbor.

"Zephyr," Cornelius said quietly. "Remain here. Do not move. Do not speak to anyone. Do not do anything that might result in additional complications."

"Not moving," Zeph mumbled. "Not speaking. Definitely not complicating."

"Excellent." Cornelius tucked his book more securely under one arm and followed Melas a short distance down the corridor, out of the boy's hearing.

The Watch captain turned to face him, arms crossed. "You want to tell me why you were fleeing through the service exit?"

"I was not fleeing. I was escorting my intern to a location with fewer people, less noise, and better air circulation. His condition required it." Cornelius met Melas's gaze without flinching. "You saw him yourself. The boy could barely stand."

"True enough." Melas tilted his head slightly, studying Cornelius the way one might study a particularly complicated knot. "But you chose to leave through the back instead of requesting a healer. Why?"

"Because I am not a physician, and I correctly assessed that the Rotunda would shortly become far more chaotic than it already was." Cornelius's tail flicked once, a sharp gesture of impatience. "I made a tactical decision to remove Zephyr from an environment that was actively worsening his symptoms. There is no mystery here, Captain. Only basic logic."

"Mm." Melas did not look convinced, but he did not press the point. "And the book you're clutching like it's made of solid gold?"

"It is a first edition of *The Theory of Aether*, signed by Fabrizio Lucchesi approximately thirty minutes before his death." Cornelius's claws tightened protectively on the leather binding. "It is worth considerably more than solid gold, and I will not be parted from it under any circumstances short of direct divine intervention."

"Not asking you to give it up." Melas's mouth twitched, though whether toward a smile or a grimace was unclear. "Just making sure you're not hiding evidence in there."

The implication made Cornelius's scales prickle with indignation. "If I were concealing evidence, Captain, I would choose a far less conspicuous location than a rare book I have been visibly protecting all evening. I would also be significantly more subtle in my departure. I am many things, but incompetent is not among them."

"No. You're not incompetent." Melas's expression shifted, becoming more serious. "Which is why I'm going to ask you directly. Did you see anything unusual tonight? Before Lucchesi fell?"

Cornelius considered the question. He could refuse to answer—technically, Melas had not yet taken his formal statement, and this conversation existed in a legal gray area. But there was also value in appearing cooperative. And, more importantly, the question itself was interesting.

"Define unusual," Cornelius said carefully.

"Anything that struck you as wrong. Out of place. Inconsistent with expectations."

Cornelius's mind sorted through the evening's events, cataloguing and cross-referencing. "Lucchesi's speech was vapid but not unusually so for his recent work. His toast followed traditional ceremonial format. The wine was poured from a common decanter and distributed by servers to all the guests simultaneously. I observed no one approaching Lucchesi's glass specifically, though my vantage point was limited."

"Where exactly were you standing?"

"Eastern colonnade. Approximately forty feet from the platform. My attention was divided between the speech and monitoring Zephyr's condition." Cornelius paused, his analytical mind catching on a detail. "Though I did note that Lucchesi's hands were not entirely steady when he opened my book for signing. I attributed this to nerves or excessive wine consumption, but it could indicate an underlying medical condition."

Melas pulled a small notebook from his coat pocket and made a brief notation. "Anything else?"

"The onset of his collapse was extremely rapid. Three to four seconds between drinking and falling. That timing suggests either a very potent poison or a catastrophic failure of a vital organ." Cornelius tilted his head, his golden eyes narrowing behind his spectacles. "You have already reached this conclusion yourself. You would not have sealed the building otherwise."

"Maybe I'm just being thorough."

"You are being thorough and suspicious, which is appropriate given the circumstances." Cornelius adjusted his glasses. "You will check Lucchesi's glass for residue, examine the wine decanter, and interview all the servers who handled the refreshments. You will also speak with everyone who had access to the platform in the hour before the speech. Standard investigative procedure."

"Thanks for the instruction." Melas's tone was bone-dry. "Anything else I should know about my own job?"

"Several things, but you are unlikely to appreciate the input." Cornelius folded his wings more tightly against his body. "I assume we are finished here?"

"For now. I'll need your formal statement later." Melas gestured back toward the Rotunda. "Keep the boy in sight. Keep yourself available. And Master Drake? Do not try to leave again."

"I gave you my legal analysis of your authority." Cornelius started back toward the corridor. "I did not say I planned to test it."

He found Zeph exactly where he had left him, though the boy had slumped further down the wall and appeared to be either sleeping or unconscious. Cornelius nudged him with one wing.

"Still alive?"

"Debatable," Zeph muttered without opening his eyes.

"Can you walk?"

"Why?"

"Because remaining in a corridor while the Captain organizes his investigation is inefficient and exposes you to unnecessary traffic." Cornelius glanced back toward the Rotunda, where guards were beginning to organize the guests into groups. "We are going to relocate to a more defensible position."

"Sure. Fine. Whatever." Zeph pushed himself upright with visible effort, using the wall for support. "Where are we relocating to?"

"I have not decided yet." Cornelius spread his wings and lifted off the ground, hovering at eye level with the boy. "But staying here guarantees we will be interrogated last, after hours of tedious waiting. I prefer to control my schedule rather than have it controlled for me."

They emerged from the service corridor into the Rotunda proper. The chaos had transformed into organized activity. Mayor Barca stood on the platform near Lucchesi's covered body—someone had draped a ceremonial cloth over the corpse—giving instructions to a cluster of assistants. Guards moved through the crowd, separating people into groups. A healer Cornelius did not recognize was speaking quietly with Captain Melas near the main doors.

The crowd itself had sorted into rough social strata. The Tile Families and other prominent citizens clustered near the center of the room, their expressions ranging from impatient to outraged. Lesser merchants and civic officials occupied the middle distance. At the edges, servers and musicians huddled in uncomfortable silence, clearly aware they would be the last interviewed and the first suspected.

Cornelius's gaze swept across the assembly, his mind automatically cataloguing important details. Sophia Doukas stood with her family near the southern colonnade, her face tear-streaked but composed. She did not look in Zeph's direction, which suggested either she had not seen him or she was deliberately ignoring him. Neither option boded well for the boy's romantic prospects.

Near the platform, a woman Cornelius did not immediately recognize was speaking with Mayor Barca. She wore a dark gray gown cut in an academic style, and her hands moved expressively as she talked. Something about her posture suggested distress, though she was controlling it with visible effort.

"Who is that?" Zeph asked quietly, following Cornelius's gaze.

"Unknown. Though given her position near the Mayor and her emotional state, I would speculate she is connected to Lucchesi in some professional capacity." Cornelius adjusted his spectacles, wishing he had a better angle. "She is either deeply affected by his death or an excellent performer."

"Maybe both."

"A possibility worth noting."

A sharp whistle cut through the ambient noise. Captain Melas stood in the center of the Rotunda, two fingers still at his lips. "Attention! The Mayor has provided a private room for key witnesses. The following individuals will come with me now: Imelda Kassiani, Valerian Sphinx, Chloe Karellas, and the woman I just saw speaking with Mayor Barca—that would be you, miss."

The woman in gray nodded, dabbing at her eyes with a handkerchief.

Cornelius's interest sharpened immediately. Those were not random selections. Imelda was the Head Librarian and one of the city's most respected intellectuals. The Karellas name belonged to a prominent shipping family. A Sphinx-kin would be valuable in any investigation—their species could not lie without physical symptoms. And the unknown woman had just been elevated to "key witness" status.

This was the core of the investigation. The people closest to Lucchesi. The ones who might know why someone would want him dead.

The ones Cornelius needed to observe.

He made his decision in the space of two heartbeats.

"Zephyr." Cornelius kept his voice low. "Stay here. Find somewhere to sit. Do not engage with Sophia or her family. When the guards take your statement, provide only factual observations—what you saw and heard, nothing more. Do you understand?"

"Yeah, I understand. Where are you going?"

"To join the key witnesses."

Zeph's eyes widened. "They're not going to let you just walk in there."

"They will absolutely attempt to prevent it." Cornelius adjusted his grip on his book, tucking it more securely against his chest. "Which is why I will not be walking."

Before Zeph could protest, Cornelius launched himself upward. His wings caught the air, and he spiraled up toward the Rotunda's painted dome. Below, a few guests noticed and pointed. Cornelius ignored them with the practiced ease of someone who had spent over a century being stared at.

He reached the stone railing of the second-floor gallery and landed with precision, folding his wings. From this vantage point, he could see the entire Rotunda laid out like a diagram. Captain Melas was leading his selected witnesses toward a corridor on the western side—likely toward the Mayor's private reception room. If Cornelius timed this correctly, he could intercept them before the door closed.

He followed the gallery's curve, moving quickly along the balustrade. His claws clicked softly on the marble. Below, the crowd had returned to nervous waiting, their attention focused on the guards taking statements rather than on the small dragon circumnavigating the upper level.

Cornelius reached the western side just as Melas and his group entered the corridor. He spread his wings and dropped from the gallery, gliding down in a controlled descent that ended precisely in front of the Watch captain.

Melas stopped short, nearly colliding with him. "Master Drake."

"Captain." Cornelius settled on the floor, his book still clutched protectively. "I am joining this group."

"No. You are not."

"I am absolutely joining this group. I possess crucial knowledge of the victim's work, expertise in document analysis that may prove relevant to your investigation, and a demonstrated capacity for logical deduction that exceeds—"

"You're a witness, not an investigator." Melas crossed his arms. "And you're going to turn around and wait with everyone else for your statement to be taken."

"I have already provided you with preliminary observations. I am now offering my services as a consultant." Cornelius drew himself up to his full height, which was admittedly not impressive in absolute terms but which carried a certain rhetorical weight nonetheless. "I am the Library Dragon of Solterra Bay. Fabrizio Lucchesi signed my book tonight because he respected my expertise in aetheric theory. I knew his early work better than anyone in this building, possibly better than he knew it himself. If you are investigating his death, you need my knowledge."

"What I need," Melas said slowly, "is for you to stop being difficult and go wait with the other witnesses."

"I am not being difficult. I am being useful. There is a significant difference."

Behind Melas, Imelda stepped forward. The Head Librarian was an elegant woman who radiated calm authority the way lamps radiated light. Her silver-white hair was wound with copper beads that clicked softly as she moved. Her expression, as always, was serene.

"Theodoros." She placed one hand on the Captain's shoulder. "Let him come."

Melas turned, his expression pained. "Imelda, I am trying to run an investigation here. I cannot have every interested party simply deciding to include themselves because they feel like it."

"Cornelius does not feel like anything. He thinks. Constantly. Often to the point of being insufferable." Imelda's gaze shifted to Cornelius, one eyebrow raised. "You are being insufferable at the moment."

"I am being thorough," Cornelius corrected.

"You are being both." Imelda looked back at Melas. "But he is also correct that his knowledge of Lucchesi's work is unmatched. If you are going to question us about the victim, having Cornelius present may save time. He can verify facts, provide context, and catch inconsistencies."

Melas stared at her for a long moment. Then he sighed, the exhalation of a man who had lost an argument before it truly began. "Fine. He can observe. But Master Drake? You will be silent unless I ask you a direct question. You will not interrogate my witnesses. You will not touch anything. Clear?"

"Perfectly clear, Captain." Cornelius's tail swished once, a gesture of satisfaction. "I shall be a model of decorum."

Melas muttered something that sounded like "doubt that" but gestured for the group to continue down the corridor. They proceeded in silence, their footsteps echoing off the stone walls.

The Mayor's reception room stood at the corridor's end, its door marked with the city's seal. Melas opened it and ushered them inside.

The space was smaller than Cornelius had expected but elegantly appointed. Comfortable chairs upholstered in deep blue fabric ringed a low table. Oil lamps hung from bronze fixtures, casting warm light across walls decorated with framed maps of Solterra Bay's historical development. A sidebar held a tea service, untouched.

Cornelius counted five people in addition to himself and Melas. Imelda settled into a chair near the window with the grace of someone entirely comfortable in any environment. The woman in gray took a seat opposite her, still clutching her handkerchief. A young siren woman—Chloe Karellas, based on the Captain's earlier announcement—perched on the edge of a chair, her expression wary. And there, standing rather than sitting, was a figure Cornelius had not seen clearly in the Rotunda.

The Sphinx-kin was tall and angular, with the golden eyes and tufted ears characteristic of his kind. He wore scholar's robes in deep burgundy, and his expression was carefully neutral. When he noticed Cornelius's attention, he inclined his head in acknowledgment.

"Valerian," he said quietly. "I was Signore Lucchesi's assistant."

"Cornelius Drake." Cornelius moved to an unoccupied chair and climbed onto its seat, settling with his book in his lap. "I am the Library Dragon, and I am here to help Captain Melas understand what happened tonight."

Melas closed the door and turned to face them, his weathered face set in grim lines. "Let me be clear. A man is dead. Until I know why and how, everyone in this room is a witness. Some of you may be suspects. I will be asking questions. You will provide honest answers. If you refuse, I will hold you here until you change your mind or my time limit expires." His gaze swept across them. "Anyone have a problem with that?"

Silence.

"Good." Melas pulled out his notebook. "Then let us begin."

Cornelius settled into the chair, his claws resting lightly on his book. Around him, the key witnesses to Fabrizio Lucchesi's death waited for their interrogation. Outside, the Rotunda was sealed. The investigation had begun.

And Cornelius, despite his repeated insistence that he was merely a librarian, found himself exactly where he had known he would end up.

At the center of the mystery.

# Chapter 4

The Mayor's reception room smelled of beeswax polish and old leather, which Cornelius found marginally more tolerable than the Rotunda's cacophony of competing perfumes. He sat on the blue upholstered chair with his book balanced carefully on his lap, watching Captain Melas arrange his witnesses like a general positioning troops before battle.

The Watch captain had spent the last five minutes establishing rules, boundaries, and consequences. Cornelius respected the thoroughness even as he found it tedious. Melas was creating structure where chaos had reigned, imposing order on a situation that desperately required it. These were impulses Cornelius understood on a fundamental level.

"I will speak with each of you individually," Melas was saying, his weathered face set in grim lines. "Starting with Valerian, as Signore Lucchesi's assistant. The rest of you will wait here. No discussing the case amongst yourselves. No leaving this room without my explicit permission. Clear?"

Murmurs of assent circled the room.

Melas gestured to the Sphinx-kin. "Valerian. With me."

The tall figure in burgundy robes rose smoothly and followed the Captain through a side door that led, Cornelius assumed, to an even smaller private office. The door closed with a soft click.

Silence settled over the remaining occupants. Imelda had produced a small book from somewhere in her robes and was reading with apparent serenity. Chloe Karellas perched on the edge of her chair, her fingers drumming a nervous pattern on her knee. The woman in gray—still unnamed—stared at the floor, her handkerchief clutched in white-knuckled hands.

Cornelius's tail twitched with irritation. He had maneuvered his way into this group specifically to observe the investigation, not to sit in enforced silence while Melas conducted interviews one at a time in another room. This was inefficient. Wasteful. A poor use of his time and talents.

His claws flexed against the leather binding of his book. The signed inscription was still there, of course, perfectly preserved beneath the cover. *To Cornelius Drake, a fellow scholar who understands that knowledge is the foundation upon which all truth must rest. With admiration, Fabrizio Lucchesi.*

The irony was not lost on Cornelius that the man who had written those words was currently lying dead under a ceremonial cloth twenty yards away.

He needed to see the scene again. Properly this time, without the interference of panic and crowds. The podium, the glass, the wine spreading across marble—there would be evidence there. There had to be. People did not simply die at precisely orchestrated moments without leaving traces of cause and method.

Cornelius made his decision with the same swift certainty he applied to cataloguing decisions. Waiting here served no purpose. Examining the actual location of Lucchesi's death would.

He stood, tucking his book under one forearm.

Imelda glanced up from her reading. "Going somewhere?"

"I require access to the facilities," Cornelius said with perfect composure. "Unless Captain Melas expects us to remain confined without basic accommodations?"

The Head Librarian's expression suggested she knew exactly what Cornelius was actually planning, but she merely raised one elegant eyebrow. "I imagine the facilities are in the hall. Do try not to cause additional complications."

"I never cause complications," Cornelius replied. "I resolve them."

He crossed to the main door and pushed it open with one wing. The corridor beyond was quieter than before, though he could hear the low murmur of voices from the Rotunda's direction. Two guards stood at attention near the reception room, but neither moved to stop him as he padded down the hallway.

The Grand Rotunda had transformed yet again. The crowd had thinned considerably—Melas's guards had clearly processed the least relevant witnesses and released them from the six-hour detention window. Perhaps two dozen people remained, clustered in small groups and speaking in hushed tones. The atmosphere had shifted from panic to something more unsettling: the peculiar quiet that followed violence, when everyone was still processing what they had witnessed.

The platform where Lucchesi had delivered his speech stood empty except for the covered body. Two guards flanked it, their expressions professionally neutral. The ceremonial cloth draped over the corpse was deep blue, embroidered with the city's seal in silver thread. Someone—probably Mayor Barca's staff—had cleaned up the spilled wine, though Cornelius could still see a faint stain on the marble where the glass had shattered.

He needed closer access. The podium itself would contain the most useful evidence—anything Lucchesi had touched, anything that had been near his glass, any trace of what had killed him.

Cornelius spread his wings and lifted off silently, gliding up toward the second-floor gallery. Flying had certain advantages when dealing with guards who were trained to watch for people walking. He landed on the stone balustrade and made his way around the curve until he was directly above the platform.

From this vantage point, he could see the entire scene laid out below him. The podium stood slightly to the left of center stage, a simple wooden structure with a slanted reading surface. Lucchesi's notes—pages of carefully prepared remarks—still rested there, their edges fluttering slightly in the air currents from the Rotunda's ventilation.

The wine glass and decanter had been removed, presumably already in Melas's custody for examination. But the platform itself, the floor, the immediate area where Lucchesi had stood for those final moments—those had not been thoroughly searched. Cornelius could tell by the way the guards stood. They were protecting the body, not preserving a crime scene. Melas had not yet had time to conduct a proper forensic examination.

Which meant Cornelius had a window of opportunity.

He glanced down at the guards. They were facing outward, watching the remaining guests rather than looking up. Cornelius calculated angles, trajectory, and the likely location of visual blind spots.

Then he folded his wings and dropped.

The controlled descent brought him down behind the podium, in the space between the wooden structure and the backdrop of ceremonial curtains. His claws touched the platform without sound. He froze, waiting to see if the guards had noticed.

Neither turned.

Excellent.

Cornelius crept forward, keeping his body low and his movements precise. His book remained tucked against his chest—he would not set it down, not even to investigate a murder. Some priorities were non-negotiable.

The podium's reading surface held Lucchesi's speech notes, now irrelevant testimony to a presentation that had ended in death. Cornelius ignored them. Paper and ink told stories, certainly, but not the story he needed right now.

He focused on the floor immediately around the podium's base. This was where Lucchesi had stood. Where he had raised his glass. Where he had taken that fatal sip.

Cornelius's vision sharpened, shifted into the particular clarity that came from being a creature formed from knowledge itself. Other dragons saw in darkness or detected heat. Library Dragons saw truth written in physical forms—the age of paper, the composition of ink, the molecular structure of materials.

He examined the wooden floor of the platform, inch by meticulous inch.

There—just at the base of the podium's left leg. A scatter of tiny granules, barely visible against the dark wood. Blue. Crystalline. No larger than grains of sand.

Cornelius's breath caught.

He moved closer, his golden eyes narrowing behind his spectacles. The crystals glittered faintly in the lamplight, their color a distinctive azure that seemed to shift between blue and violet depending on the angle. They formed a small cluster, perhaps a dozen grains, as if someone had spilled a pinch of something and not noticed.

Or had not cared.

His mind began cataloguing possibilities. Blue crystal formations. Magical residue. Alchemical compounds. There were perhaps fifteen substances in Solterra Bay that matched this description, and Cornelius knew the properties of all of them. But he needed closer examination to determine which—

A flash of pale wood caught his attention.

Three inches from the blue crystals, caught in a gap between two floorboards, was a single pencil shaving. Cedar, based on the color and grain pattern. Curled into a perfect spiral, the kind produced by a very sharp blade applied at a precise angle.

Cornelius tilted his head, studying it. A pencil shaving at a formal gala. Incongruous. People used fountain pens for formal occasions, not pencils. And certainly no one sharpened pencils on a ceremonial platform during a major speech.

Unless the shaving had been there before the speech. Or had fallen from someone's pocket. Or—

"Master Drake."

Cornelius's wings snapped tight against his body. He looked up to find Captain Melas standing at the edge of the platform, arms crossed, expression hovering somewhere between exasperation and resignation.

"Captain," Cornelius said with as much dignity as he could muster while crouched behind a podium he was not supposed to be examining. "I was just—"

"Investigating my crime scene without permission." Melas's voice was flat. "Yes. I noticed."

"I prefer to think of it as conducting a preliminary survey to assist your official investigation."

"I prefer to think of it as you ignoring my explicit instructions." The Watch captain climbed onto the platform, his boots heavy on the wooden boards. "I told you to wait in the reception room."

"You told me I could not interrogate witnesses or touch evidence. I have done neither." Cornelius straightened, adjusting his spectacles with one claw. "I have merely observed."

"With your face six inches from my crime scene."

"Observation requires proximity." Cornelius glanced back at the blue crystals and the pencil shaving. "And I have found something you should examine."

Melas's expression shifted slightly. "Found what?"

"Come see for yourself."

The Captain moved to Cornelius's position and crouched, studying the floor where Cornelius indicated. His weathered face revealed nothing, but Cornelius saw the way his eyes narrowed, the subtle shift in his posture that indicated sharp attention.

"Blue crystals and wood shavings," Melas said after a moment. "What am I looking at?"

"Evidence." Cornelius resisted the urge to touch the crystals, though he desperately wanted to examine them more closely. "The blue granules are some form of crystalline compound. The shaving is cedar, freshly cut based on the color preservation. Both are out of place at a formal event."

"Could have been here before the gala. Maintenance oversight."

"Possible but unlikely. This platform was specifically prepared for tonight's event. The wood has been polished recently—I can see the oil residue. Any debris from earlier preparation would have been removed." Cornelius moved his wing to indicate the crystals without touching them. "These were deposited within the last few hours."

Melas pulled a small evidence envelope from his coat and carefully collected the blue crystals using a pair of tweezers. Then he did the same with the pencil shaving, sealing both in separate containers and labeling them with quick, efficient handwriting.

"You should not have been here," he said as he worked. "But I suppose I should thank you for the sharp eyes."

"You should employ me as a formal consultant," Cornelius said. "My visual acuity exceeds that of any human investigator, and my knowledge of potentially relevant substances is encyclopedic."

"I will take that under advisement." Melas stood, pocketing the evidence. "Now get back to the reception room before I decide you are more trouble than you are worth."

Cornelius spread his wings to comply, then paused. "Captain. When you identify what those crystals are, I would appreciate being informed. I have... theories."

"I am sure you do." Melas gestured toward the edge of the platform. "Go. And Master Drake? No more unauthorized investigations."

"Of course not," Cornelius said, in a tone that promised absolutely nothing.

He glided down from the platform and landed near the eastern colonnade, folding his wings with deliberate precision. His mind was already sorting through the catalog of blue crystalline substances, cross-referencing properties and potential applications. The color was distinctive. The size suggested careful grinding or natural formation at a specific temperature range. And the location—scattered at the base of the podium where Lucchesi had stood—

"Master Drake?"

Cornelius turned to find Zeph approaching from the direction of the washrooms. The boy looked marginally better than he had earlier, though his face was still drawn and his movements careful. He also looked miserable in a way that had nothing to do with physical pain.

"Zephyr." Cornelius examined his intern with clinical attention. "Your color has improved. The headache?"

"Fading." Zeph glanced around the Rotunda, his expression wary. "Most people left already. Captain Melas let them go if they were far from the platform and didn't see anything useful."

"Sensible. Detaining two dozen irrelevant witnesses for six hours serves no investigative purpose." Cornelius tilted his head. "You appear distressed beyond your usual level of gala-induced misery. What happened?"

Zeph's jaw tightened. "I tried to talk to Sophia."

"Ah."

"It went badly."

"I surmised as much from your expression." Cornelius glanced across the Rotunda, where Sophia stood with her family near the southern colonnade. The girl was not looking in their direction. "Elaborate."

"I found her in the hallway. Wanted to apologize for earlier, for running out on her mom's questions." Zeph's hands clenched into fists. "Started to explain about the headache, about how the noise gets too much, about—"

He stopped, his breath hitching.

Cornelius recognized the signs immediately. The slight widening of the eyes. The tension in the shoulders. The way Zeph's hands moved to his temples as if to physically hold his skull together.

"The pain returned," Cornelius said.

"Middle of the conversation," Zeph confirmed, his voice tight. "Just slammed into me. Couldn't finish a sentence. Sophia kept asking if I was okay, and I couldn't even answer her properly. Just stood there like an idiot, making these pathetic half-sounds while my head felt like it was splitting open."

"What did she do?"

"Called one of the healers over. They checked me out, said nothing was physically wrong, recommended rest." Zeph's expression was bleak. "Sophia looked at me like—like she doesn't know if I'm actually sick or just looking for excuses to avoid her family."

Cornelius's tail moved in a sharp, irritated gesture. The Doukas girl was operating from fear and ignorance, which made her reaction understandable but not helpful. And Zeph's condition, whatever its ultimate cause, was clearly genuine. Cornelius had seen enough of the boy's episodes to know they were not performance.

"Miss Doukas is struggling to reconcile her established understanding of normal human physiology with evidence that contradicts it," Cornelius said. "This creates cognitive dissonance, which manifests as doubt regarding your veracity."

"She thinks I'm lying."

"She thinks you might be exaggerating, which is different. Though the practical effect on your relationship is similarly detrimental." Cornelius adjusted his book, using the familiar weight to ground his thoughts. "You cannot control her interpretation of events. You can only control your own behavior and truthfulness."

"Great. So I just keep collapsing in front of her until she either believes me or dumps me."

"Or until we determine the actual cause of your condition and address it properly." Cornelius fixed Zeph with a steady gaze. "These headaches are not normal. The sensory overload is not normal. The scent I detect around you during episodes is definitely not normal."

Zeph blinked. "Scent?"

"Like air before a lightning strike. Ozone and electricity." Cornelius kept his voice matter-of-fact. "I noticed it during your first episode tonight and again just now when you mentioned the pain returning. You are manifesting some form of atmospheric change when under distress."

"That's..." Zeph trailed off, looking unsettled. "That's not possible."

"And yet it occurs. Which suggests either a previously undiagnosed magical sensitivity or something more fundamental about your nature that has not yet been properly identified." Cornelius filed away Zeph's reaction for later analysis. "But this is not the time for that investigation. We are currently occupied with determining who killed Fabrizio Lucchesi and why."

"Right. The murder." Zeph straightened slightly, though he still looked drained. "Did you find anything useful?"

"Potentially." Cornelius glanced back toward the platform, where the guards still flanked Lucchesi's covered body. "Blue crystals and a pencil shaving near the podium. Both out of place at a formal event. Captain Melas has collected them as evidence."

"Blue crystals? Like, drugs?"

"Unlikely at this particular social stratum, though I will not rule anything out until chemical analysis is complete." Cornelius's mind was still turning over possibilities, sorting and categorizing. "The color and crystalline structure suggest several possibilities. I will need access to reference materials to narrow the options."

"Which means you want to go back to the Library."

"Eventually. First I intend to remain here long enough to observe the conclusion of Captain Melas's initial interviews." Cornelius moved toward an unoccupied chair near the colonnade and climbed onto it, settling with his book in his lap. "Sit. Rest. Try not to have another episode. And avoid Miss Doukas for the remainder of the evening unless you wish to have an emotional conversation while trapped in a sealed building."

Zeph sat on the floor beside the chair, leaning back against the column. "Avoiding Sophia. Got it."

They lapsed into silence. Around them, the Rotunda maintained its eerie quiet. Guards stood at attention. Remaining witnesses spoke in hushed clusters. Somewhere in the Mayor's reception room, Captain Melas was questioning Valerian about Lucchesi's final hours.

And on the platform, beneath the ceremonial cloth, a man lay dead.

Cornelius's claws drummed thoughtfully against his book's leather binding. Blue crystals. Cedar shavings. A death timed to the precise moment of a toast. The elements were present for a solution. He simply needed to arrange them in the correct pattern.

His mind drifted back to the crystals. That particular shade of blue, shifting to violet in certain light. The size of the granules. The way they had scattered in a loose cluster rather than a uniform distribution.

And then, with the sudden clarity of a reference shelf appearing in his mind's eye, Cornelius knew.

"Judgment Salt," he said aloud.

Zeph looked up. "What?"

Cornelius's golden eyes were fixed on the middle distance, seeing not the Rotunda but the pages of a book he had read fifteen years ago. *Rare Compounds of the Eastern Provinces*, third edition, chapter seven. "The blue crystals. They are Judgment Salt."

"Never heard of it."

"Most people have not. It is exceedingly rare and expensive to produce." Cornelius's tail began moving in slow, thoughtful arcs. "An alchemical compound with very specific properties. When ingested, it has no effect on the innocent. But for those who carry guilt—particularly for serious crimes—it acts as a rapid and potent poison."

Zeph went very still. "It only kills guilty people?"

"In theory." Cornelius's mind was racing now, implications cascading through his consciousness like books falling from an overstuffed shelf. "Though the precise mechanism of how it determines guilt is poorly understood. Some scholars believe it responds to the subject's own moral certainty. Others theorize it detects aetheric disruption caused by deliberate harm to others."

"So someone used magic poison that only kills bad people." Zeph's voice was carefully neutral. "On Fabrizio Lucchesi. Who wrote books about aether theory."

"Yes."

"Which means—"

"Which means," Cornelius finished, his claws tightening on his book, "that either our killer believed Lucchesi was guilty of something worth execution, or Lucchesi actually was guilty, and the Judgment Salt simply enacted its intended function."

His gaze moved back to the covered body on the platform. The famous author. The respected scholar. The man who had signed Cornelius's book with words about truth and knowledge.

What had Fabrizio Lucchesi done to deserve death by Judgment Salt?

And who had known enough to use it?

# Chapter 5

"You are absolutely not doing this."

Cornelius did not slow his pace down the corridor. His claws clicked against the marble with metronomic precision, each step carrying him closer to the antechamber outside the Mayor's private reception room. His book remained tucked securely under one forearm.

"Your objection is noted and disregarded," he said.

Zeph half-jogged to keep up, his footsteps echoing unevenly behind Cornelius. "Captain Melas specifically told you to stay out of the investigation."

"Captain Melas told me not to interrogate his witnesses while he was conducting interviews. He is currently occupied with processing statements from the outer Rotunda. I am therefore operating within the technical boundaries of his instructions."

"That is the worst logic I have ever heard."

"It is impeccable logic. The flaw lies in your interpretation, not my reasoning." Cornelius reached the antechamber—a narrow space with benches along one wall and a frosted glass window set into the door leading to the reception room proper. He stopped, setting his book carefully on the nearest bench, and turned to face his intern. "I have identified the murder weapon as Judgment Salt. Do you understand what that means?"

Zeph leaned against the wall, arms crossed. The ozone scent around him had faded to a faint trace, which suggested his headache had receded further. "It means someone used fancy poison that only kills guilty people."

"It means," Cornelius corrected, "that someone in that room either knew Lucchesi was guilty of something significant, or believed he was guilty with sufficient conviction to execute him for it. Either scenario requires investigation by someone who understands the implications."

"Someone like Captain Melas. Who is literally a professional investigator."

"Captain Melas is a competent officer operating under severe time and resource constraints. He has perhaps four hours remaining before his legal detention window expires. He must process statements from two dozen remaining witnesses, coordinate with healers and forensic examiners, secure all physical evidence, and maintain chain of custody protocols." Cornelius's tail traced a sharp arc of frustration. "He does not have time to conduct the nuanced interviews this situation demands."

Zeph's expression suggested he was marshaling another argument. Cornelius spoke before the boy could deploy it.

"Furthermore, Captain Melas lacks my specialized knowledge. I have read every major work on aetheric theory published in the last century. I knew Lucchesi's scholarship better than most people in this city, quite possibly better than Lucchesi himself. If his death relates to his work—and given the nature of Judgment Salt, it almost certainly does—then I am uniquely positioned to identify relevant connections."

"Or you just want to solve the mystery before the actual police do."

Cornelius adjusted his spectacles. "That is a contributing factor, yes. I see no reason to deny it."

Despite everything, Zeph's mouth twitched toward something that might have been a smile. "At least you're honest."

"I am always honest. Deception requires remembering false narratives, which clutters the mind unnecessarily." Cornelius turned back toward the frosted glass window. "Now. Are you going to continue objecting, or are you going to assist me?"

"Assist you with what, exactly?"

"Observation. Note-taking. Possibly preventing me from saying something that will cause Captain Melas to have me physically removed from the premises." Cornelius glanced back at the boy. "I am aware that my communication style can be... abrasive."

"You mean you're rude."

"I prefer 'precise.'"

"Most people call it rude."

"Most people are imprecise in their language and become defensive when confronted with clarity." Cornelius moved closer to the window. "Regardless. I value your perspective, and your presence will make me appear less threatening. A dragon accompanied by his assistant is conducting official Library business. A dragon alone is a meddling eccentric."

Zeph pushed away from the wall, moving to stand beside Cornelius. "I'm your human shield."

"You are my diplomatic buffer. There is a distinction."

"Sure there is." But Zeph was looking through the frosted glass now, his curiosity clearly engaged despite his protests. "Can you actually see anything through that?"

"The glass is designed to obscure detail while allowing general observation. Standard administrative architecture." Cornelius tilted his head, adjusting his angle. "But I can see shapes. Movement. Relative positions."

The frosted pane transformed the reception room beyond into an impressionist painting. Blurred figures occupied the space in a loose arrangement that Cornelius's mind automatically began cataloguing. Five people, not counting Imelda, who had positioned herself near the far wall with enviable serenity.

"Tell me what you see," Cornelius said.

Zeph squinted. "Fuzzy people in a fancy room?"

"More specific. Where are they sitting? Who is isolated? Who maintains proximity to others?"

The boy leaned closer, his breath fogging the glass slightly. "Okay. There's someone standing by themselves near the window. Someone else sitting in the center—no, two people sitting together on that couch thing. And another person sort of... off to the side, near the door to Melas's office."

"Excellent. Now apply basic social analysis. Standing alone suggests either grief-driven isolation or deliberate separation from the group. Sitting together indicates alliance or mutual support. Positioning near the office door suggests either anxiety about being called next or strategic placement to observe who enters and exits."

Zeph was quiet for a moment, his analytical mind visibly engaging with the puzzle. "The person by the window is either really upset or doesn't want to talk to the others."

"Both are possible. Continue."

"The two sitting together are probably family or close friends. You don't sit that close to someone unless you know them well or you're trying to present a united front."

Cornelius's tail moved in approval. "Very good. And the one near the office?"

"Nervous. Or controlling. Wants to know what's happening before everyone else does."

"Both viable interpretations." Cornelius committed the positions to memory, cross-referencing them with what he knew of the identified suspects. "Captain Melas named five key witnesses. Valerian, Lucchesi's assistant. Chloe Karellas from the shipping family. The woman in gray who had been speaking with Mayor Barca. And Imelda, though she is present as an institutional representative rather than a suspect."

"That's only four," Zeph said.

"I am aware. Captain Melas did not announce the fifth witness by name, which suggests either they arrived after his initial gathering or their identity is being deliberately withheld for tactical reasons." Cornelius's claws flexed against the windowsill. "However, based on the physical count beyond this glass, we can confirm five individuals plus Imelda. Unless someone has entered or departed since I last observed the room."

Zeph pressed closer to the glass, trying to resolve detail from blur. "Can you tell which one is the Sphinx? The assistant?"

"Valerian would be the tallest figure. Sphinx-kin generally exceed human height by several inches, and their posture tends toward vertical rather than the slight forward curve most humans adopt." Cornelius traced the outline of the standing figure near the window. "That one. Isolated, upright bearing, positioned to observe the entire room. Classic Sphinx positioning—they prefer vantage points that allow comprehensive awareness."

"So he's either grieving or watching everyone else."

"Again, both are possible. He was Lucchesi's assistant. He may be genuinely distressed by his employer's death. Or he may be monitoring the other suspects to gauge their reactions and statements." Cornelius's mind sorted through implications. "Sphinx-kin cannot lie without physical symptoms. That makes Valerian either the most trustworthy witness in that room or the most dangerous, depending on what truths he chooses to reveal."

Zeph shifted his weight, a gesture Cornelius recognized as the boy processing uncomfortable thoughts. "What if he killed Lucchesi?"

"Then he cannot deny it if asked directly. Sphinx physiology would betray the lie." Cornelius considered the logistics. "However, that assumes someone asks the correct question. 'Did you kill Fabrizio Lucchesi' requires a direct answer. 'Do you know who killed him' allows for more nuanced evasion."

"That's terrifying."

"That is useful." Cornelius moved his attention to the paired figures on the couch. "The two sitting together. Based on positioning and body language—even filtered through frosted glass—I would speculate those are the Karellas representatives. Shipping families tend to operate in units. They do not send individuals to important events without support structure."

"So Chloe and who? Her parent?"

"Possible. Or a family retainer. Someone with authority to speak on behalf of the House." Cornelius's tail twitched. "The Karellas family controls a significant portion of Solterra's maritime trade. Their presence at Lucchesi's speech suggests either personal interest in aetheric theory or political obligation. Neither tells us why they would be classified as key witnesses unless they had proximity to the murder itself."

"Maybe they were on the platform?"

"Perhaps. Or perhaps they had prior relationship with Lucchesi that Captain Melas considers relevant." Cornelius filed the question away for later investigation. "We will know more once we speak with them directly."

"Right. Once we break into an active police investigation."

"We are not breaking in. We are entering through an unlocked door to conduct preliminary interviews as representatives of the Library." Cornelius spoke with the confidence of someone who had already constructed his justification and found it sound. "Fabrizio Lucchesi was a published scholar whose work resides in our archives. His death directly impacts the Library's institutional interests. Therefore, Imelda—as Head Librarian—has standing to participate in the investigation, and I—as Library Dragon—am her designated proxy."

Zeph stared at him. "Did you just make that up?"

"I extrapolated from established precedent and institutional authority. Whether that constitutes 'making it up' depends on one's interpretation of legal creativity."

"Melas is going to throw you out."

"Captain Melas is occupied with witness statements and will not be present in the reception room for at least another twenty minutes based on standard interview duration." Cornelius turned away from the frosted glass, retrieving his book from the bench. "By the time he returns, I will have gathered preliminary observations that will prove useful to his investigation. He will be irritated but pragmatic. I am counting on the latter outweighing the former."

"That's a terrible plan."

"It is an efficient plan operating under imperfect conditions." Cornelius tucked the book securely under his arm and moved toward the reception room door. "Now. When we enter, you will remain near the door and observe without speaking unless addressed directly. I will conduct the interviews. If anyone becomes hostile, you will politely suggest we all remain calm and cooperative. Clear?"

Zeph rubbed his temples, a gesture that suggested his headache might be threatening a return. "This is such a bad idea."

"Your objection remains noted and disregarded." Cornelius placed one claw on the door handle, then paused. "Zephyr. I am aware this evening has been difficult for you. The incident with Miss Doukas, the headaches, being trapped in a building with a corpse—none of this was how you intended to spend your night."

The boy's expression shifted, becoming cautious. "Okay?"

"I am offering you the opportunity to be useful. To apply your analytical skills to a genuine mystery rather than dwelling on social failures you could not have prevented." Cornelius met the boy's gaze. "Sometimes the best remedy for personal distress is impersonal focus. A puzzle requires no emotional navigation. It simply requires thought."

Zeph was quiet for a long moment. Then he straightened slightly, his shoulders losing some of their defensive hunch. "You're trying to distract me."

"I am providing you with a constructive alternative to rumination. If that serves a secondary therapeutic function, I consider it an acceptable bonus outcome."

"You're a terrible mentor."

"I am an excellent mentor with unconventional methods." Cornelius returned his attention to the door. "Are you prepared?"

"No."

"Excellent. Neither am I. Excessive preparation breeds hesitation." Cornelius drew himself up to his full height—which remained unimpressive by most standards but which he had learned to deploy with maximum dignified effect. "We are representatives of the Library. We are pursuing institutional interests. We are solving a murder. In that order."

"Pretty sure the murder is first on your actual list."

"My actual list is none of your concern." Cornelius adjusted his spectacles with one claw, straightened the small bow tie he wore for formal occasions, and took a breath that filled his lungs with purpose and his mind with structure.

Then he pushed open the door.

The reception room resolved from blurred impression to sharp reality. The space was exactly as he remembered from his brief earlier presence: elegant chairs arranged in conversational groupings, oil lamps casting steady light across walls decorated with historical maps of Solterra Bay's expansion. The tea service on the sidebar remained untouched.

And there, distributed across the room in precisely the positions Cornelius had deduced from the frosted glass, were the five key witnesses to Fabrizio Lucchesi's death.

Valerian stood by the window, tall and angular, his golden Sphinx eyes tracking Cornelius's entrance with immediate sharp attention. The tufted ears that marked his kind were laid back slightly—not aggressive, but wary. His burgundy robes were immaculate despite the evening's chaos.

On the central couch, two figures sat with the careful proximity of people maintaining unity under pressure. The younger was clearly Chloe Karellas—perhaps twenty years old, with the fine bone structure and silver-touched hair characteristic of siren lineage. Beside her sat a woman who shared enough facial features to be her mother, though older and harder, with the weathered hands of someone who had spent decades on ship decks.

Near the door to Captain Melas's interview office sat a woman in gray, the same one Cornelius had observed speaking with Mayor Barca earlier. Closer proximity revealed details obscured by distance and frosted glass. She was perhaps forty, with dark hair bound in a practical knot and ink stains on her fingers. Her eyes were red from crying, but her posture remained composed.

And in the corner, occupying a chair positioned to observe the entire room, sat a man Cornelius did not recognize from Melas's earlier announcements.

He was older—perhaps sixty—with iron-gray hair and the weathered complexion of someone who spent considerable time outdoors. His clothing was expensive but worn, tailored silk that had seen years of service. He held a walking stick between his knees, both hands resting on its silver handle, and his gaze fixed on Cornelius with the flat assessment of a man evaluating potential threat.

Imelda rose from her position near the far wall, her copper-beaded hair clicking softly. "Cornelius. I was under the impression you were waiting in the antechamber."

"I was. Then I concluded that waiting served no productive purpose." Cornelius moved further into the room, his book held securely. Zeph followed, closing the door quietly behind them and taking up position against the wall with admirable unobtrusiveness. "I am here to conduct preliminary interviews on behalf of the Library's institutional interests."

The man with the walking stick made a sound somewhere between a cough and a laugh. "The dragon's conducting investigations now, is he?"

Cornelius turned to face him fully. "I am Cornelius Drake, Library Dragon of Solterra Bay. I knew Fabrizio Lucchesi's work intimately—better than most people in this city, quite possibly better than he knew it himself. His death impacts the Library's archives and scholarly community, and I am pursuing questions relevant to that impact. You are?"

The man's expression shifted, reassessing. "Giovanni Conti. I worked with Lucchesi twenty years ago, before he decided scholarly integrity was less profitable than popular fiction."

"Ah." Cornelius's mind slotted the name into place immediately. Giovanni Conti had co-authored several papers with Lucchesi in the early days, before their partnership dissolved in acrimony that had become academic legend. "The Aetheric Resonance Theory papers. You contributed the mathematical frameworks."

"I contributed the only parts of those papers worth reading," Giovanni said bitterly. "Lucchesi contributed the presentation and took the credit."

"An arrangement you apparently found unsatisfying."

"Unsatisfying enough that I stopped working with charlatans and started working alone." Giovanni's hands tightened on his walking stick. "Which is why I assume your Captain has me sitting here like a suspect. Old grudges make convenient motives."

"They do," Cornelius agreed calmly. "Though motive alone does not constitute guilt. Means and opportunity matter more."

"I had both." Giovanni's voice was flat. "I know exactly what Judgment Salt is and how it works. I have access to alchemical suppliers through my research. And I was ten feet from the platform when Lucchesi drank his poisoned wine." He met Cornelius's gaze directly. "So if you are here to conduct interviews, Library Dragon, you might as well start with me. I will save you time—yes, I hated Fabrizio Lucchesi. No, I did not kill him. Though I cannot say I am sorry he is dead."

The room held its breath.

Cornelius's tail moved in a slow, thoughtful arc. This was either spectacular honesty or a calculated gambit. Either way, it was interesting.

"I appreciate your directness," Cornelius said. "We will indeed speak, but not first. I prefer to establish context before addressing the most obviously motivated suspect." He turned toward Valerian. "You were Lucchesi's assistant. You worked with him daily. You knew his habits, his schedule, his associations. Tell me—what was Fabrizio Lucchesi actually guilty of?"

Valerian's ears flicked forward. His golden eyes were steady, but something moved behind them. Something careful.

"That," the Sphinx said quietly, "is the question Captain Melas has been trying to answer for the last hour."

"And has he succeeded?"

"Not yet."

"Then perhaps," Cornelius said, settling onto his haunches and tucking his book securely beside him, "we should try a different approach."

He looked around the room, meeting each witness's gaze in turn. The assistant. The rival. The daughter and mother. The woman in gray whose role remained unclear.

One of them knew why Lucchesi had died. One of them might have killed him.

And Cornelius intended to determine which.

# Chapter 6

"This way."

Captain Melas pulled open the door to his temporary office without ceremony. The hinges protested with a soft groan that suggested they had not been oiled in some time. Cornelius made a mental note of the oversight, catalogued it as evidence of City Hall's declining maintenance standards, and followed the Watch captain into the smaller room.

The Mayor's private office was precisely what Cornelius expected: expensive, traditional, and designed to reinforce hierarchies. Dark wood paneling covered three walls. The fourth held floor-to-ceiling shelves containing legal codes, civic records, and what appeared to be a decorative collection of antique maritime instruments that no one had touched in decades. The air smelled of beeswax polish and old leather, with an undertone of pipe tobacco that suggested Mayor Barca spent more time here than in the ceremonial spaces beyond.

A substantial desk dominated the center of the room—solid oak, probably a century old, with carved legs depicting maritime scenes. Two chairs faced it. Behind it sat the mayor's high-backed seat, currently unoccupied.

Melas gestured toward one of the facing chairs. "Sit."

Valerian moved to comply, his burgundy robes rustling. The Sphinx's hands trembled slightly as he lowered himself into the seat. His golden eyes darted between Melas and Cornelius, pupils contracting to vertical slits that marked genuine distress.

Cornelius did not take the second chair. Instead, he spread his wings and launched himself directly onto the desk's surface, landing with deliberate precision in the exact center. His claws clicked against the polished wood as he settled, adjusting his position until he achieved optimal sight lines to all occupants.

Melas's eyebrow rose. "Making yourself comfortable?"

"I am establishing appropriate authority positioning. Given my physical stature, elevation is required to maintain proper interview dynamics." Cornelius arranged his book carefully beside him, spine aligned with the desk's edge. "Proceed with your questioning, Captain. I will observe and contribute as warranted."

"How generous of you." Melas pulled the mayor's chair around to the front of the desk and sat, placing himself at Cornelius's level but facing Valerian directly. He withdrew his notebook and pencil. "For the record, Valerian. Full name and occupation."

The Sphinx's throat worked as he swallowed. "Valerian. No family name. I am—I was—Signore Lucchesi's personal assistant."

"How long did you work for him?"

"Five years. Since he moved to Solterra Bay permanently."

Melas's pencil scratched across paper. Cornelius noted the captain's handwriting was surprisingly neat for someone who spent most of his time managing street patrols and bar fights. "Describe your duties."

"I managed his correspondence. Organized his research materials. Maintained his calendar. Coordinated with publishers, event organizers, and academic institutions." Valerian's ears flicked backward, then forward again in a nervous rhythm. "I also assisted with research for his current manuscript projects."

"Which projects specifically?"

"The *Meditations on Aetheric Resonance* series. He was working on volume four." Valerian's hands clenched together in his lap. "And various shorter works. Essays for academic journals. The occasional commissioned piece for civic events."

Cornelius's tail began moving in slow, analytical arcs. The Sphinx was providing information with careful precision, each answer complete but minimal. He was not volunteering additional context. This suggested either professional discretion or deliberate concealment.

"Tonight's speech," Melas continued. "Did you help prepare it?"

"I compiled the reference materials he requested. Historical documents on Solterra's artistic heritage. Citations for the theoretical framework he wanted to discuss." Valerian's breathing had accelerated slightly. "But the actual composition was his own work. He always wrote his public addresses personally."

"When did you last see him alive?"

"Approximately fifteen minutes before the speech began. He wanted privacy to review his notes and compose himself. I left him in the preparation room behind the platform."

"Was he alone when you left?"

"Yes."

"His behavior—was it normal? Did he seem anxious, ill, distressed?"

Valerian hesitated. The pause was brief but noticeable. "He seemed... tense. But that was typical before public appearances. Signore Lucchesi enjoyed being the center of attention, but he also felt the pressure of maintaining his reputation."

Cornelius leaned forward slightly. "His hands were shaking when he signed my book. Approximately twenty minutes before his death. Was that also typical?"

The Sphinx's gaze shifted to Cornelius, then away. "He had a tremor. It worsened when he was tired or stressed. He took medication for it, usually before major events."

"What medication?"

"I do not know the specific name. A powder he mixed with wine. His physician prescribed it."

"Did he take it tonight?"

"I—" Valerian stopped. His hands unclenched, then clenched again. "I assume so. He kept the medication in his personal effects. I did not observe him taking it directly."

Melas made another note. Cornelius's mind catalogued the information, cross-referencing it with the blue crystals he had found. Medication mixed with wine. The timing aligned too perfectly. If Lucchesi regularly consumed a powder dissolved in wine before public speeches, substituting that powder with Judgment Salt would be straightforward for anyone with access to his preparation routine.

"Who else knew about this medication?" Cornelius asked.

Valerian's ears flattened completely against his skull. "I—many people. His physician, certainly. Anyone who worked closely with him would have noticed the tremor."

"That was not my question. I asked who knew about the medication specifically. The timing of its use, the method of consumption, the routine surrounding it."

The Sphinx's breathing had become audible now, rapid and shallow. "His physician. Myself. Perhaps his housekeeper, though I cannot confirm that."

Cornelius's claws flexed against the desktop. Three people, by Valerian's accounting. A very small circle. Intimate knowledge.

"Let us discuss your relationship with Signore Lucchesi," Cornelius said. His voice remained level, academically neutral, but he watched Valerian's physical responses with absolute focus. "You worked for him for five years. That suggests either exceptional professional compatibility or significant financial dependency. Which was it?"

"I—both. Neither." Valerian's hands were shaking visibly now. "It was complicated."

"Elaborate."

"Signore Lucchesi was a brilliant scholar. Working with him provided access to research I could not have conducted independently. The position was prestigious. The compensation was adequate."

"That is a professional assessment. I asked about your relationship."

Valerian said nothing for several seconds. His golden eyes had gone very still, the kind of stillness that preceded either flight or violence. Then he exhaled slowly, his tufted ears drooping.

"I hated him," he said quietly.

The words fell into the room like stones into still water.

Melas stopped writing. Cornelius's tail went completely motionless.

"You hated him," the captain repeated. "Your employer. The man you worked for daily for five years."

"Yes."

"Why did you continue working for him?"

"Because I had no choice." Valerian's voice had shifted, losing its careful professional neutrality. Raw anger bled through now, controlled but present. "Signore Lucchesi was famous, respected, influential. I was his assistant. In the academic community, that relationship defined me. If I left without his recommendation, I would be unemployable in any comparable position. He knew that. He used it."

Cornelius felt a peculiar sensation in his chest—something that might have been recognition or might have been sympathy. He understood institutional power. He understood being trapped by the very structures one served.

"Used it how?" Melas asked.

"Credit. Recognition. Authorship." Valerian's hands unclenched, spreading flat against his thighs as if he were trying to ground himself. "The research I conducted for him—the citations I found, the frameworks I developed—they appeared in his publications under his name alone. Occasionally I would receive acknowledgment in a footnote. More often I received nothing."

"That is standard academic practice," Cornelius said, though he found the practice distasteful. "Research assistants provide support. Principal authors receive attribution."

"I was not a research assistant." Valerian's gaze locked onto Cornelius, and the dragon saw something cold and hard beneath the Sphinx's nervous exterior. "I wrote his last two books. Entirely. He provided outlines, concepts, general direction. I produced the actual manuscripts. The words, the arguments, the structure—all mine. Published under his name."

Ah.

Cornelius's mind recalibrated. Ghostwriting was not uncommon among popular authors who needed to produce content faster than their actual writing ability allowed. But it created complicated questions of ownership, credit, and recognition. Questions that could fester into genuine grievance.

"Did anyone else know about this arrangement?" Melas's pencil was moving again, taking rapid notes.

"No. Signore Lucchesi insisted on complete confidentiality. He said revealing the arrangement would damage both our reputations—his for not writing his own work, mine for being willing to sell my words. He said we were protecting each other."

"But you did not feel protected."

"I felt exploited." Valerian's voice cracked slightly. "My work. My research. My ideas. Published to great acclaim, reviewed in every major journal, discussed by scholars across three continents. And I received a salary and a footnote."

Cornelius's tail resumed its slow movement. The pattern was clarifying. Motive, certainly—years of accumulated resentment toward an employer who had systematically stolen intellectual credit. Access to Lucchesi's routines, including his medication schedule. Knowledge of rare alchemical compounds that a research-oriented Sphinx might plausibly have encountered in academic contexts.

The framework for murder was present. What remained was confirmation.

"Where were you when Signore Lucchesi collapsed?" Melas asked.

"Standing near the eastern colonnade. Perhaps fifteen feet from the platform."

"Did you see him drink from his glass?"

"Yes."

"Did you see anyone approach him immediately beforehand? Anyone who might have tampered with the wine?"

Valerian's breathing had become ragged. A fine sheen of moisture had appeared on his forehead despite the room's cool temperature. "No. I was not watching the platform continuously. I was—I was trying not to watch him at all."

"Because you hated him."

"Yes."

"Because he had stolen your work."

"Yes."

"Because you wanted him dead."

Valerian flinched as if struck. His ears flattened completely. His hands gripped the chair arms hard enough that his knuckles went pale beneath his fur.

And he sneezed.

It was a violent, explosive sneeze that shook his entire frame. He fumbled for a handkerchief, pressed it to his face, and sneezed again. Then a third time.

Cornelius's attention sharpened to absolute focus. Sphinx-kin sneezed when exposed to lies. Their physiology rejected falsehood with physical symptoms that could not be suppressed or hidden. It was one of the fundamental truths about their kind, as reliable as sunrise.

Valerian had just sneezed three times in immediate succession.

After denying that he wanted Lucchesi dead.

Melas had gone very still. His weathered face revealed nothing, but his gaze had shifted to Cornelius. A silent question passed between them.

Cornelius gave the smallest nod of confirmation. Yes. The sneeze was significant. Yes, it indicated deception.

The captain set down his pencil with deliberate care. "Valerian. Did you poison Fabrizio Lucchesi?"

The Sphinx's handkerchief was still pressed to his face. His golden eyes were wide above the fabric, pupils dilated. His entire body trembled.

"No," he said. The word was muffled by the handkerchief but distinct. "I did not kill him."

He sneezed again. Violently. Then once more.

Cornelius felt certainty settle into his mind like a well-organized index. The pattern was complete. The evidence aligned. Valerian had means—access to Lucchesi's medication routine. Motive—years of stolen credit and suppressed resentment. Opportunity—close proximity during the critical timeframe.

And now, when asked directly if he had committed murder, his own physiology betrayed him.

"I think we have sufficient grounds for formal detention," Cornelius said quietly. His voice carried absolute conviction. "The evidence is clear."

Melas nodded slowly. "Valerian, I am placing you under official Watch custody pending further investigation into the death of Fabrizio Lucchesi. You will be transferred to—"

"Wait."

The voice came from the corner where Zeph had positioned himself. The boy had been so quiet that Cornelius had almost forgotten his presence. Now Zeph pushed away from the wall, his expression troubled.

"Something is wrong," Zeph said.

Cornelius's tail twitched irritation. "The evidence is conclusive. Sphinx physiology does not lie."

"I know. But the timing was off." Zeph moved closer to the desk, his dark eyes focused on Valerian with uncomfortable intensity. "He sneezed after the first question, not the second one. Captain Melas asked if he wanted Lucchesi dead—sneeze. Then he asked if Valerian poisoned him—different question, same answer, also sneeze. That does not make sense."

Cornelius opened his mouth to dismiss the observation, then stopped.

Zeph was correct.

If Valerian's physiology reacted to lying about killing Lucchesi, it should have reacted specifically to that question. But the initial sneezing fit had occurred in response to denial about wanting the man dead. The second set of sneezes might have been continuation of the first reaction rather than response to the murder question specifically.

The pattern was not as clean as Cornelius had initially assessed.

"Valerian," Cornelius said carefully. "Did you want Fabrizio Lucchesi dead?"

The Sphinx lowered his handkerchief. His face was blotchy, his breathing still unsteady. He looked directly at Cornelius.

"No," he said.

He sneezed. Twice.

"Yes," he amended, his voice hoarse. "Sometimes. When I was angry, when he dismissed my work or humiliated me in front of publishers or took credit for ideas I had developed—yes. I wanted him dead. I fantasized about his death. I imagined how it might happen."

No sneeze.

Cornelius's certainty wavered slightly. Truth was more complicated than he had initially calibrated.

"But I did not kill him," Valerian continued. "I did not poison his wine. I did not tamper with his medication. I did not arrange his death in any way."

Sneeze. A single harsh explosion of breath.

"I wanted to survive him," Valerian said desperately. "I wanted to outlast him. I wanted to eventually escape and publish under my own name and have people finally know that I was the one who wrote those books. Death would have freed me from his employment, but it would not have given me that recognition. It would not have restored what he took."

His breathing was coming in gasps now. "I needed him alive long enough to either acknowledge my contribution or to make enough mistakes that people started questioning the quality of his later work. I needed evidence, documentation, some way to prove my authorship. His death destroys all of that. It makes him a martyr to scholarship and locks me into permanent anonymity."

He pressed the handkerchief to his face again, his shoulders shaking.

No sneeze this time.

Cornelius's mind recalibrated with uncomfortable speed. The logic was sound. An aggrieved ghostwriter would indeed have more to gain from eventual exposure than from murder. Death elevated Lucchesi's reputation. It sealed his published works as final testament. It eliminated any possibility of future acknowledgment.

If Valerian truly wanted credit for his intellectual work, killing Lucchesi was the worst possible strategy.

"But you were lying about something," Melas said. His voice had shifted to a different tone—not accusatory, but probing. "The sneezing indicates deception. What were you lying about?"

Valerian did not respond immediately. His hands twisted the handkerchief into tight spirals.

"Valerian," Cornelius said. His analytical mind was sorting through alternatives now, looking for patterns that explained the physical evidence without requiring murder. "What happened between you and Lucchesi that you do not want to reveal?"

The Sphinx's ears drooped until they nearly touched his shoulders. When he finally spoke, his voice was barely audible.

"We were lovers."

The words hung in the air.

Cornelius blinked. Melas's pencil went still.

"Three years ago," Valerian continued. "It lasted eight months. He ended it when he started courting someone else—someone with better connections, someone who could advance his social position. But we continued working together. Professional relationship maintained. Nothing acknowledged publicly."

He looked up, meeting Cornelius's gaze directly.

"So yes. I lied when I said I did not want him dead. Because part of me did want him dead—the part that remembered being discarded, being used, being reduced to convenient resource. But I also still..." He stopped. Started again. "It was complicated. My feelings were complicated. Hate and grief are not mutually exclusive."

Sneeze.

No. Wait.

Cornelius analyzed the timing more carefully. The sneeze had come during discussion of Valerian's feelings, not his actions. The Sphinx was lying about his emotions, not about facts. He was trying to simplify complicated truth into cleaner categories.

"You still loved him," Cornelius said quietly.

Valerian's eyes closed. "I do not know what I felt. I hated him. I resented him. I grieved what we might have been if he had been capable of seeing me as anything more than useful. All of that existed simultaneously." His voice cracked. "And now he is dead, and I will never have resolution for any of it."

The room was silent except for the faint scratching of Melas's pencil resuming its note-taking.

Cornelius's tail had gone completely still. He recognized the phenomenon Valerian described—the cognitive dissonance of holding contradictory truths about the same person. The human tendency to reduce complex relationships to simple narratives. Love or hate. Victim or villain. Reality was messier.

And messy reality did not lead to tidy convictions.

"Did you kill Fabrizio Lucchesi?" Melas asked again. His voice was gentle this time, almost kind.

"No." Valerian's answer was immediate and clear.

No sneeze.

"Do you know who did?"

"No."

No sneeze.

"Do you have any information that might help identify the killer?"

Valerian hesitated. "I know he had enemies. People who felt he had wronged them academically, professionally, personally. The list would be extensive."

"But no one specific comes to mind? No threats, no confrontations, nothing that seemed dangerous?"

"There was..." Valerian stopped. Considered. "Giovanni Conti confronted him two weeks ago. At the Library. I was not present for the entire conversation, but I heard shouting. Something about stolen research and academic fraud."

Cornelius's attention sharpened. "Giovanni was in the reception room. He admitted openly that he hated Lucchesi."

"Giovanni has hated Lucchesi for twenty years," Valerian said. "Their feud is academic legend. But he confronted him specifically two weeks ago, and the argument was more heated than usual."

Melas made a note. "I will follow up on that. Anyone else?"

"The Karellas family had some business arrangement with him. I do not know the details—Signore Lucchesi kept his financial arrangements private. But I know there were letters back and forth with their trade office, and he seemed anxious about maintaining that relationship."

More notes. "Anything else?"

Valerian shook his head slowly. Then stopped. "There was a woman. She came to the house three times in the last month. I never learned her name—Signore Lucchesi always met with her in his private study with the door closed. But she dressed like administrative staff, and she had ink stains on her hands."

Cornelius's mind immediately conjured the woman in gray from the reception room. Ink-stained fingers. Recent tears. Professional bearing.

"Describe her," Melas said.

"Forty, perhaps. Dark hair. Plain clothing, gray or brown, practical rather than fashionable. She always arrived in the early afternoon and stayed for perhaps an hour."

"Did Lucchesi seem concerned about these meetings?"

"He seemed... focused. Intent. Like the meetings mattered to him professionally." Valerian's ears twitched forward slightly. "But I do not know what they discussed."

Melas finished writing and closed his notebook. "Thank you, Valerian. You will still need to remain available for additional questioning, but you are not under arrest at this time."

The Sphinx's entire frame sagged with visible relief. "Thank you."

"You are free to return to the reception room. Please do not discuss this conversation with the other witnesses."

Valerian stood on unsteady legs and moved toward the door. He paused at the threshold, looking back at Cornelius.

"I did not kill him," he said quietly. "But I understand why you thought I might have. The evidence looks damning. I am sorry I could not provide clearer answers."

Then he was gone, the door closing softly behind him.

Cornelius remained on the desk, his mind processing the interview's outcomes. He had been certain. The pattern had seemed complete. And yet Zeph's observation about timing had unraveled that certainty, revealing a more complicated truth beneath.

"He is telling the truth," Melas said. It was not a question.

"Yes. About the murder, at least." Cornelius adjusted his spectacles. "Though his emotional state is genuinely chaotic. Complicated grief makes for unreliable affect."

"But not unreliable facts." Melas reopened his notebook to a fresh page. "So we are back to multiple suspects with motive and no clear mechanism for how the poison was administered."

"Not quite." Cornelius's tail began moving again, slower now, more contemplative. "We have new information. Giovanni Conti's recent confrontation. The Karellas family's business arrangement. The mysterious woman with ink-stained hands."

"Who is probably the woman currently sitting in the reception room."

"Almost certainly."

Zeph had remained silent during the exchange, but now he moved to stand beside the desk. His face was drawn, and Cornelius detected the faintest trace of ozone scent around him—stress response, manageable but present.

"You were right about the timing," Cornelius said to his intern. "Good catch."

Zeph's expression shifted slightly toward surprise. "You are admitting I was right?"

"I am acknowledging that your observation corrected my premature conclusion. That is not the same as admitting fault—I was working with incomplete information and provisional hypothesis. But yes. Your intervention prevented a significant investigative error."

"I will take it." Zeph rubbed his temples briefly, then stopped when he noticed Cornelius watching. "I am fine. Just tired."

"Noted." Cornelius turned back to Melas. "Who do you want to interview next?"

The captain consulted his notes. "Giovanni Conti seems like the logical choice. Recent confrontation, admitted hatred, knowledge of Judgment Salt."

"He also admitted all of that unprompted," Cornelius pointed out. "Which suggests either remarkable honesty or calculated misdirection."

"Or arrogance." Melas stood, tucking his notebook away. "Some people believe being obvious makes them less suspicious."

"Then let us test that theory." Cornelius gathered his book, tucking it securely under one forearm. "Bring in the bitter rival. I am curious to see whether his honesty extends to genuine cooperation or merely to dramatic confession."

Melas moved toward the door, then paused. "Master Drake. That was good work. Noticing the pattern with the sneezing."

"It was adequate work that drew a false conclusion," Cornelius corrected. "Zephyr's intervention made it good work."

"Still. You found physical evidence at the crime scene that my guards missed. You identified Judgment Salt from crystalline residue. You conducted a thorough interrogation that revealed significant context." Melas's weathered face shifted into something that might have been approval. "You are proving useful despite being deeply irritating."

"I will accept that as the highest compliment you are capable of offering."

"It is." Melas pulled open the door. "I will retrieve Conti. Try not to antagonize him so thoroughly that he refuses to answer questions."

"I make no promises."

The captain left. Cornelius remained on the desk, organizing his thoughts into clear categories. Suspects. Motives. Evidence. Connections.

The pattern was still there, waiting to be discovered.

He simply needed to look at it from the correct angle.

# Chapter 7

# Chapter 7

Zeph needed air.

Not literal air—the Mayor's office had plenty of that, even if it smelled like old tobacco and furniture polish. But he needed space. Distance. Something other than the weight of Captain Melas's questions and Cornelius's analyzing stare and the knowledge that somewhere in this building, a dead body lay under a ceremonial cloth.

Also, his head still hurt.

Not the skull-splitting agony from earlier. That had faded to a dull throb that sat behind his eyes like a bruise. Manageable. Survivable. The kind of pain he could work through if he just had a minute to himself.

"I need the washroom," he said quietly.

Cornelius glanced up from where he sat on the Mayor's desk, his golden eyes sharp behind his spectacles. "Again?"

"Yeah. Again." Zeph kept his voice level. "Sorry my bladder isn't as disciplined as yours."

The dragon's tail twitched, but he didn't argue. "Do not wander. Return directly here when finished."

"Sure."

Melas had already left to retrieve Giovanni Conti from the reception room. Zeph slipped out the door before Cornelius could change his mind or assign him some analytical task that required thinking harder than his headache would allow.

The corridor outside was blessedly quiet. Most of the guests had been released from the Rotunda by now, their statements taken and their alibis noted. Only the key witnesses remained, trapped in their elegant waiting room like expensive fish in a bowl.

Zeph turned away from the reception room and the washrooms both, heading deeper into City Hall's administrative warren. He just needed five minutes. Maybe ten. Long enough for his head to stop pounding and for the weird electric feeling under his skin to settle.

Long enough to not think about Sophia's face when the healer had told her there was nothing physically wrong with him.

The corridor opened into a wider gallery. Zeph stopped at the threshold, recognizing the space from a school visit years ago. The Hall of Mayors. A long room lined with portraits of Solterra Bay's civic leaders going back two centuries. Between the paintings, bronze plaques marked the Tile Family sponsorships—intricate mosaics showcasing which house had funded which year's civic improvements.

The gallery was dim. Someone had turned down the oil lamps to save fuel now that the official ceremonies were over. The portraits hung in pools of shadow, their painted eyes watching Zeph with the judgment of the historically important dead.

Perfect.

Zeph moved into the room, his footsteps loud on the marble floor. He found a bench positioned beneath a portrait of some mayor from fifty years ago—a stern-looking satyr with magnificent horns—and sat down hard.

His hands were shaking slightly.

He pressed them flat against his thighs, willing them to stop. This was stupid. He was fine. The headache was fading. He'd caught an important detail during Valerian's interrogation—noticed the timing of the sneezes when even Cornelius had missed it. That was good. That was useful.

That was exactly the kind of thing he was supposed to be doing as Cornelius's intern.

So why did he feel like he was falling apart?

"There you are."

Zeph's head snapped up. Sophia stood at the gallery entrance, backlit by the corridor's brighter lamps. Her formal gown—deep blue silk that her mother had spent a fortune on—caught the light as she moved toward him. Her face was composed now, the earlier tears gone, but her posture was rigid.

"Hey," Zeph said. His voice came out rougher than intended. "I was just—"

"Running away again?"

The words hit like a slap. Zeph felt his spine straighten defensively. "I wasn't running away. I needed a minute to clear my head."

"Right. Like you needed a minute during dinner with my parents. And a minute before my cousin's recital. And a minute at the Spring Festival when my mother specifically asked to speak with you." Sophia stopped a few feet away, arms crossed. "You always need a minute, Zeph."

"That's not fair."

"Isn't it?" Her voice was calm, which somehow made it worse. Anger he could have handled. This quiet disappointment felt like drowning. "You promised tonight would be different. You said you'd meet my family properly. You said you'd try."

"I did try!" The words came out louder than Zeph intended. He forced himself to lower his volume. "I was there. I said the thing about the mosaics, exactly like Cornelius taught me. I was doing it."

"Until you ran to the washroom and disappeared for twenty minutes." Sophia's jaw tightened. "My mother thinks you were sick from nerves. My father thinks you're rude. And I had to stand there smiling like nothing was wrong while your absence made me look like an idiot."

The word hung between them. Idiot. Not him—her. She thought his problems made *her* look bad.

"I had a headache," Zeph said flatly. "A really bad one. I told you that."

"You always have a headache. Or your stomach hurts. Or you're too tired. Or something." Sophia's composure cracked slightly, frustration bleeding into her voice. "And then tonight, when it actually mattered, you did it again. Even after the healer said there was nothing wrong with you."

"The healer was wrong."

"Was she?" Sophia took a step closer. "Or do you just not want to be here? Because if you don't want to meet my family, if you don't want to do the work of actually being together in public, you could just say so. It would be kinder than making me guess whether you're actually sick or just avoiding things that make you uncomfortable."

Zeph stood up. The movement made his head throb, but he ignored it. "You think I'm faking?"

"I think something is always conveniently wrong with you when I need you to be present." Sophia's voice wavered. "I think I keep making excuses for you, and you keep proving that maybe I shouldn't."

The air between them felt charged. Electric. Like the moment before lightning struck.

Zeph's hands clenched at his sides. He wanted to explain. Wanted to tell her about the way crowds scraped against his skin like sandpaper, how loud noises felt like knives in his skull, how sometimes the world narrowed to a crushing point of pain that made thinking impossible.

But how could he explain something he didn't understand himself?

"It's real," he said quietly. "The headaches. The sensitivity. All of it. I'm not making it up, and I'm not trying to embarrass you."

"Then what *are* you trying to do?" Sophia's eyes were bright with unshed tears. "Because from where I'm standing, it looks like you're perfectly fine working for Cornelius on library projects or solving murder mysteries with the Watch, but the moment I need you to stand beside me for an hour and smile at my mother, you fall apart."

That wasn't fair. That wasn't—

Except it kind of was, wasn't it?

Zeph had managed to observe Valerian's interrogation. Had noticed the sneeze timing. Had walked through corridors and climbed stairs and functioned adequately once the immediate crisis of the Rotunda's chaos had passed.

But he hadn't been able to stand in front of Sophia's family for five minutes without fleeing.

"It's different," he said helplessly. "The investigation is—I can focus on it. It's external. A puzzle. Your family is..."

"Stressful?" Sophia's laugh was bitter. "My family is stressful, but a murder investigation is relaxing? Do you hear yourself?"

"That's not what I meant."

"Then what did you mean?"

Zeph opened his mouth. Closed it. He didn't know how to explain that his brain could handle analyzing evidence and tracking details because those things had rules. Clear cause and effect. Observable patterns.

But social situations—especially high-pressure ones with Tile Family matriarchs judging his career prospects and his worthiness to date their daughter—those had no rules he understood. No patterns he could follow. Just endless chances to fail.

"I meant," he said slowly, "that I'm trying. I know I'm not good at this stuff. I know your family thinks I'm just some random library intern with no prospects. But I'm doing my best."

"Your best leaves me standing alone explaining your absence to my mother." Sophia's voice cracked. "Your best makes me look like someone who can't even keep her date from running away."

"I wasn't running away from you."

"That's what it feels like."

The words settled between them like stones. Zeph felt something in his chest twist painfully. This wasn't how tonight was supposed to go. He'd rehearsed the mosaic compliment. Worn his good shirt. Tried so hard to be the kind of person who could stand beside a Doukas daughter without making her regret it.

And he'd failed anyway.

"I'm sorry," he said quietly. "I know I keep screwing this up. But I swear, Sophia, I'm not trying to embarrass you. The headaches are real. I just—I don't know what's wrong with me."

Sophia stared at him for a long moment. Something in her expression shifted. Not softening exactly, but changing. When she spoke again, her voice was tired.

"Maybe that's the problem. You don't know what's wrong, so you can't fix it. And I can't keep making excuses for something neither of us understands." She wrapped her arms around herself. "I need to think about whether this is working. Whether we're working."

Zeph's stomach dropped. "What does that mean?"

"It means I don't know if I can do this anymore. The uncertainty. The constant wondering if you'll actually show up or if I'll be left explaining your absence again." She looked away. "I care about you, Zeph. But I can't be the only one holding this together."

"You're not—"

"I am." Sophia met his gaze again. "I'm the one making plans around your limitations. Choosing quiet restaurants. Avoiding my family's big events. Pretending I don't mind when you disappear. And I've done it gladly because I thought you were worth it. But tonight..."

She trailed off. Shook her head.

"I should get back to my family. They'll wonder where I am." She turned toward the corridor, then paused. "When you figure out what's actually going on with you—or when you decide to be honest about what you really want—you can find me. Until then, I need space."

Then she was gone, her footsteps echoing down the corridor.

Zeph stood frozen beneath the portrait of the long-dead satyr mayor. His hands had started shaking again. The headache, which had faded to a manageable throb, suddenly spiked—a sharp lance of pain behind his right eye that made him gasp.

And beneath it, the electric feeling. The sense of pressure building in the air around him. The smell like ozone before a storm.

He pressed the heel of his hand against his temple, breathing slowly. In for four counts. Hold for four. Out for four. The technique Cornelius had taught him.

It helped. Marginally.

When he could think clearly again, Zeph made himself move. He couldn't stay here staring at portraits and feeling sorry for himself. Cornelius would want to know what had taken so long. Melas probably had Giovanni Conti in the office by now, and Zeph was supposed to be observing, learning, making himself useful.

Proving he was worth something even if Sophia didn't think so anymore.

He turned back toward the corridor—and stopped.

Voices. Low and tense, coming from the far end of the gallery where a smaller hallway branched off toward the administrative offices.

Zeph moved quietly toward the sound. His headache made stealth easier than usual—he was already moving carefully to avoid jarring his skull.

Two figures stood in the shadowed alcove near a door marked "Records Storage—Authorized Personnel Only." One was tall and broad-shouldered, dressed in expensive evening clothes with the sharp tailoring that marked wealth. The other was smaller, wearing servant's livery, their posture hunched and deferential.

"—told you to keep it quiet," the larger man was saying. His voice carried edges of aristocratic authority and poorly suppressed anger. "The shipment should have been processed three days ago. Why am I hearing about delays now?"

"Sir, the dockmaster noticed irregularities in the customs forms. He flagged them for review—"

"Then *un-flag* them. That is what we pay him for, is it not?"

The servant shifted uncomfortably. "He's nervous, sir. After the Veneti scandal last year, everyone's being more careful with maritime imports. He says if the Harbor Authority decides to inspect—"

"The Harbor Authority will not inspect because they will not have reason to." The larger man stepped closer, using his height to loom. "You will go to the dockmaster tonight—yes, tonight, I do not care that it is late—and you will remind him that our arrangement benefits him far more than strict adherence to bureaucratic oversight. Clear?"

"Yes, sir. Of course, sir."

"And the other matter? The one I specifically told you to handle personally?"

"The documents are secured. No one has access except—"

"Good. Keep it that way." The man's voice lowered further. "Given tonight's unfortunate event with Lucchesi, we cannot afford additional scrutiny. Everything must appear perfectly legitimate."

Zeph's breath caught. Lucchesi?

He pressed himself against the wall where the gallery met the alcove, making himself as small as possible. His heart hammered against his ribs. The headache spiked again—bright and sharp—but he forced himself to stay still.

"What about the Kallistos inquiry?" the servant asked.

"Stall them. Claim processing delays due to the festival preparations." The man adjusted his jacket with sharp, irritated movements. "And for heaven's sake, keep the family name out of official correspondence. Use the shell companies. That is literally why we established them."

"Yes, sir. I understand."

"You had better." The man turned toward the gallery exit—toward where Zeph was hiding.

Zeph stopped breathing. His headache had evolved into something worse—the full electric pressure of imminent danger, the feeling that used to precede his worst episodes. The ozone smell filled his nose, sharp and acrid.

The man strode past without noticing him. Zeph caught a glimpse of his profile in the dim lamplight—strong features, graying temples, the confident bearing of someone born to command.

Pavlos Karellas. He'd been sitting with Chloe and Irene in the reception room. Shipping family. Powerful enough to worry about rival Tile Families and harbor inspections and documents that needed to stay "secured."

The servant scurried after him, practically jogging to keep up.

Zeph waited until their footsteps faded completely before he let himself breathe again. His hands were shaking worse than before. The headache had become a living thing, pulsing in time with his racing heartbeat.

But his mind was working.

Pavlos Karellas was involved in something shady. Something that required bribing dockmasters and hiding documents and using shell companies. Something connected enough to Lucchesi that Pavlos was worried about scrutiny "given tonight's unfortunate event."

That seemed important.

That seemed like something Cornelius needed to know.

Zeph pushed away from the wall and headed back toward the Mayor's office, forcing his legs to move steadily despite the way his head throbbed with each step. The corridor seemed longer than before, the oil lamps casting shadows that moved wrong.

He was probably imagining that last part. Headache hallucinations were a thing, right?

By the time he reached the office door, Zeph had his story prepared. He'd been delayed. He'd gotten turned around in the corridors. Totally normal.

He pushed the door open.

Inside, Cornelius sat on the desk in his usual position of maximum authority. Captain Melas occupied the mayor's chair. And seated in the interview chair, looking distinctly annoyed about it, was Pavlos Karellas.

The man's eyes flicked to Zeph as he entered, then dismissed him as unimportant. Just the dragon's assistant. Some kid.

Zeph kept his expression neutral and moved to his usual observation spot near the back wall. His heart was still racing. The headache made thinking difficult, but he forced himself to focus.

Cornelius caught his gaze briefly. One scaled eyebrow rose a fraction—a silent question. *Where were you?*

Zeph gave the smallest nod. *Later.*

The dragon's tail twitched acknowledgment, then his attention returned to Pavlos.

"—understand your time is valuable, Master Karellas," Melas was saying, his notebook open. "I will try to be brief."

"Please do." Pavlos adjusted his cufflinks with the air of a man accustomed to far more important meetings. "I have already explained that I barely knew Lucchesi personally. Our business relationship was minimal."

"Yet you attended his speech tonight."

"My daughter is interested in aetheric theory. I accompanied her as a courtesy."

Cornelius's golden eyes gleamed behind his spectacles. "A courtesy that required your wife's presence as well? Interesting. Most fathers would simply send a note of permission."

Pavlos's jaw tightened almost imperceptibly. "My wife and I support our daughter's intellectual pursuits. Is there a crime in that?"

"None whatsoever," Cornelius said pleasantly. "Though it does suggest the evening held more significance than mere academic curiosity might warrant."

The man's fingers drummed once against the chair arm—a tiny gesture of irritation quickly suppressed.

Zeph leaned against the wall and watched. His headache throbbed. The ozone smell lingered faintly in his nose.

And somewhere in this building, a murderer was waiting to be found.

Probably not the same person who was bribing dockmasters and hiding shipping documents.

Probably.

But Zeph had learned enough tonight to know that probably wasn't the same as certainly.

He made himself focus through the pain and watched Pavlos Karellas lie to the dragon and the captain about things that might matter more than any of them yet understood.

# Chapter 8

# Chapter 8

The evidence bag sat on the Mayor's desk like an accusation.

Cornelius had positioned it precisely in the center of the leather blotter, aligned with the edges at perfect right angles. The blue crystals inside caught the lamplight, refracting it into tiny violet sparks against the translucent material. Beautiful, in an abstract sense. Deadly, in a very concrete one.

Captain Melas had released Pavlos Karellas fifteen minutes ago. The man's alibi was airtight—surrounded by family and prominent witnesses during the entire critical window. His evasive answers about business dealings had been noted for future investigation, but they were not germane to the immediate question of murder.

Which left Cornelius sitting on a desk, staring at crystals, waiting for scientific confirmation of what his instincts had already concluded.

He did not enjoy waiting.

"She should be here by now," he muttered.

Melas glanced up from his notebook. The captain had commandeered the corner of the desk for his own workspace, spreading his notes into organized piles that suggested military training. "Imelda said an hour. It has been forty-seven minutes."

"Forty-eight." Cornelius adjusted his spectacles with one claw. "And she said approximately an hour, which could mean anywhere from fifty-five to sixty-five minutes depending on her interpretation of acceptable variance."

"You are aware that normal people do not calculate conversation timeframes to that degree of precision."

"I am aware that normal people make imprecise commitments and then wonder why coordination fails." Cornelius's tail moved in small, agitated arcs. "If one says 'an hour,' one should mean exactly sixty minutes. Language exists to convey specific meaning."

"Language also exists to avoid sounding like a timepiece." Melas made another notation. "She will arrive when she arrives. Your anxiety will not accelerate the process."

"I am not anxious. I am appropriately impatient given the gravity of the situation and the necessity of timely information."

"Right. That is a completely different thing."

Cornelius opened his mouth to deliver a lecture on the distinction between anxiety and justified impatience, then stopped. The captain was baiting him. Deliberately using conversational tactics to distract him from productive analysis.

It was working, which was irritating.

He forced his attention back to the evidence bag. The crystals were distinctive—that particular shade of blue-violet occurred in very few natural compounds, and even fewer alchemical preparations. The crystalline structure was regular, suggesting intentional formation rather than accidental precipitation. The size distribution was uniform, indicating careful grinding and sifting.

Someone had prepared this poison with skill and deliberation.

The thought settled uncomfortably in his mind. Premeditation suggested planning. Planning suggested motive strong enough to justify not just murder, but this specific method. And if his hypothesis about the crystals' identity was correct, the method itself carried implications that extended far beyond simple assassination.

The door opened without ceremony.

Imelda Kassiani entered as she did everything else—with absolute authority and no wasted motion. She wore her formal librarian's robes, the deep green fabric embroidered with copper thread in patterns that marked her rank. Her silver-white hair was still arranged in its traditional braided crown, though several hours of crisis management had loosened a few strands around her temples. She carried a leather document case that Cornelius recognized as coming from the Library's secure archive.

"Head Librarian," Melas said, standing. "Thank you for coming personally."

"I would not have delegated this." Imelda set the case on the desk beside Cornelius, her movements precise. She smelled faintly of reagents—sulfur and copper salts, the distinctive markers of alchemical testing. "The analysis required verification through three separate methodologies. I conducted all of them myself."

Cornelius felt his breathing accelerate slightly. "And?"

Imelda opened the case and withdrew a sheet of heavy paper covered in her meticulous handwriting. Chemical formulas. Test results. Comparative analysis against archived samples.

"Your identification was correct." She met his gaze directly, her ancient eyes steady. "The substance is *Sal Judicium*. Judgment Salt."

The words hung in the air like a pronouncement.

Cornelius had suspected. Had analyzed the crystalline structure and the method of death and arrived at the hypothesis through logical deduction. But having it confirmed—hearing Imelda say it with absolute certainty—transformed suspicion into horrible fact.

"You are certain?" His voice came out quieter than intended.

"I am never uncertain about alchemical identification." Imelda's tone carried the weight of nearly two centuries of scholarship. "I tested against authenticated samples from the Archive. The composition matches exactly. Rare earth minerals in specific proportion, ritually prepared according to methods documented in only five known texts. This is not a substance that occurs naturally or can be synthesized accidentally."

Melas had gone very still. "Explain what this means. For those of us without alchemical training."

Imelda turned to face him fully. When she spoke, her voice carried the cadence of lecture—clear, authoritative, designed to convey complex information to attentive students.

"Judgment Salt is an ancient compound with a unique property. When consumed, it remains completely inert in individuals who bear no significant guilt. They experience no symptoms whatsoever. The substance passes through their system harmlessly and is eliminated without consequence."

She paused, letting that information settle.

"However, when consumed by someone who carries genuine moral or legal guilt—someone who has committed acts they themselves recognize as wrong, or who has violated laws they understand to be just—the compound becomes violently toxic. Death occurs rapidly, usually within seconds of ingestion."

Melas's weathered face had shifted into an expression that Cornelius could not entirely parse. Something between horror and grim recognition.

"So it is not poison in the traditional sense," the captain said slowly. "It is a test."

"It is a judgment." Imelda's voice remained level, but Cornelius detected the undercurrent of professional distaste. "An alchemical manifestation of moral consequence. The guilty condemn themselves through the very act of consumption."

Cornelius's mind was already racing through implications. "The mechanism—is it psychological? Does it respond to the subject's own perception of guilt?"

"That is one theory. Another suggests it reacts to objective moral transgression independent of the subject's awareness or remorse." Imelda withdrew a second document from her case—this one older, the paper yellowed and covered in archaic script. "The texts disagree on the exact mechanism. What they agree on is the result. Only the guilty die."

"Which means Lucchesi was guilty." Melas said it flatly, establishing the obvious conclusion.

Cornelius felt something twist in his chest. The signed book sat beside him, its inscription still visible through the protective covering he had applied. *Knowledge is the foundation upon which all truth must rest.* Such noble words. Such certainty in the value of intellectual pursuit.

"Guilty of what?" he asked.

"That would be the relevant question." Imelda reclaimed the document, returning it carefully to her case. "Judgment Salt does not discriminate between types of guilt. Murder and fraud would trigger the same reaction. So would serious betrayal, deliberate harm, calculated exploitation. Any act the perpetrator understands to be genuinely wrong."

"Valerian said Lucchesi stole his intellectual work," Cornelius said. His analytical mind sorted through possibilities even as he spoke. "Claimed credit for research and writing that was not his own. That could constitute the kind of knowing wrong that would trigger the compound."

"It could," Imelda agreed. "Though one would need to determine whether Lucchesi himself felt genuine guilt over such actions. Many people rationalize their behavior into righteousness."

Melas had started pacing—short, controlled movements that suggested a military background trying to impose order on disturbing information. "How rare is this substance? You said it requires ritual preparation."

"Extremely rare. The base minerals are difficult to source even with unlimited funds. The preparation process requires both alchemical expertise and access to specific texts that describe the methodology. Those texts exist in perhaps a dozen collections worldwide." Imelda's gaze shifted to Cornelius. "We have one in the restricted archives. It has not been accessed in forty-three years."

"Meaning the killer either found another source for the information or has had access to that knowledge for decades," Cornelius said.

"Or brought the compound with them from elsewhere," Melas added. "If it is as stable as you suggest, it could have been prepared years ago and stored until needed."

"It is exceptionally stable. Properly sealed, it would remain potent indefinitely." Imelda folded her hands. "Which makes it ideal for patient planning."

Cornelius's tail had gone completely still. His mind constructed and deconstructed theories with mechanical precision. Someone had poisoned Lucchesi with a substance that only killed the guilty. That suggested the killer either knew about Lucchesi's wrongdoing specifically or was conducting a test to expose it. Either way, the method itself carried a message.

This was not murder for profit or passion. This was execution.

"We are dealing with someone who believes they are administering justice," he said quietly.

"That would be my assessment as well." Imelda's ancient eyes held his. "Judgment Salt is not a weapon of convenience. It is a weapon of moral certainty. The killer chose this method because they wanted Lucchesi judged."

The room felt colder suddenly. Cornelius adjusted his position on the desk, his claws clicking against wood as he redistributed his weight. The signed book seemed to mock him—this artifact of admiration for a man who had apparently died because his own conscience condemned him.

"How many people in Solterra Bay would have the knowledge to use this compound?" Melas had stopped pacing, his posture shifted into the alert stillness of active hunting.

"Hard to say with certainty. Academic alchemists definitely. Anyone with serious classical education might have encountered references. And of course, anyone who specifically researched methods of... moral enforcement." Imelda's mouth tightened slightly—the closest she came to visible disapproval. "There are traditions that value this kind of thing. Secret societies. Religious orders committed to rooting out corruption through supernatural means."

"Wonderful," Melas muttered. "So we are looking for either an academic with access to rare texts, or a religious fanatic with alchemical training, or possibly someone from a secret society dedicated to magical vigilantism."

"Those categories are not mutually exclusive," Cornelius pointed out. "Giovanni Conti has the academic background. So does Valerian, though we have largely eliminated him as a suspect. The Karellas family deals in rare imports—they could have sourced the compound through trade connections."

"Or the killer could be someone we have not yet identified." Melas retrieved his notebook, flipping to a fresh page. "Someone who attended the gala specifically to execute this plan."

Cornelius's mind rejected that hypothesis instinctively. "The timing was too precise. Access to Lucchesi's medication routine suggests intimate knowledge of his habits. This was an inside attack."

"Agreed. Which brings us back to our current suspect pool." Melas's pencil moved across paper with sharp, decisive strokes. "I will need to re-interview everyone with that framework in mind. Not looking for ordinary motive, but for moral crusading."

The door opened again—slowly this time, without the confidence of Imelda's entrance.

Zeph slipped into the room like a shadow trying not to be noticed. His face was pale, the kind of bloodless pallor that suggested either illness or shock. His dark hair stuck up at odd angles as if he had been running his hands through it repeatedly. The ozone scent that characterized his stress episodes clung to him faintly—not the overwhelming electrical charge from earlier, but present enough that Cornelius's sensitive nose detected it immediately.

Cornelius felt his attention sharpen with concern he would not have acknowledged aloud. "You look terrible."

"Thanks. That's helpful." Zeph closed the door behind him and leaned against it, his breathing slightly uneven. "Are you done with the Karellas interview?"

"For now." Melas was studying Zeph with the professional assessment of someone who spent his career reading physical distress. "Are you unwell? Do you require medical attention?"

"No. I'm fine. Just..." Zeph waved one hand vaguely. "Long night."

Cornelius did not believe that for a moment. Zeph's heart rate was elevated—he could hear it from across the room, faster than exhaustion alone would explain. The boy's hands were shaking slightly despite obvious efforts to control them.

Something had happened while he was wandering the corridors.

"What did you need to tell me?" Cornelius asked.

Zeph's gaze flicked to Imelda, then Melas, then back to Cornelius. "Is it okay to talk in front of everyone?"

"Head Librarian Kassiani has full clearance for any Library-related matters. Captain Melas is conducting the official investigation. Unless you witnessed something requiring strict confidentiality, general disclosure is appropriate."

"Right. Okay." Zeph pushed away from the door, moving to stand near the desk. His hands found his pockets—a defensive posture Cornelius recognized. "I overheard Pavlos Karellas talking to someone. One of his staff, I think. They were by the Records Storage area."

Melas's attention focused with predatory intensity. "When?"

"Maybe twenty minutes ago? I was trying to find a quiet place to—it doesn't matter. Point is, Karellas was giving orders about pushing through some delayed shipment. Told his guy to pressure the dockmaster, avoid Harbor Authority inspection, keep the family name off official documents using shell companies."

The captain's pencil was already moving. "Did he reference what the shipment contained?"

"No. But he mentioned keeping 'documents' secured with limited access. And he specifically said everything needed to look legitimate 'given tonight's unfortunate event with Lucchesi.'" Zeph's voice gained steadiness as he focused on the information rather than whatever was distressing him. "He's worried the murder investigation will create extra scrutiny that could expose whatever he's hiding."

Cornelius felt his analytical mind shift into a different configuration. Parallel crimes. Intersecting timelines. The possibility that Lucchesi's death had value beyond simple revenge—that it might serve to distract official attention from other illegal activities.

"Did Karellas see you?" Melas asked.

"No. I was around the corner. He walked right past without noticing."

"Good." The captain made several more notations. "That gives us leverage for a follow-up interrogation. Suspicion of customs fraud, document tampering, possible bribery of port officials. We can apply pressure there."

"But is it connected to the murder?" Zeph looked to Cornelius for confirmation. "Or is it just... separate criminal enterprise happening at the same time?"

Cornelius considered the question with appropriate seriousness. "The timing is suspicious, but correlation does not establish causation. Karellas's smuggling operation—assuming that is what we are discussing—could be entirely independent of Lucchesi's death. However, the killer's use of Judgment Salt suggests they may have been targeting other guilty parties as well."

He felt the theory crystallize as he spoke. "What if Lucchesi was not the only intended victim? What if the killer is working through a list?"

The room went silent.

Imelda's ancient eyes narrowed. "You are suggesting an orchestrated campaign rather than isolated revenge."

"I am suggesting that someone willing to use Judgment Salt is someone who has appointed themselves arbiter of moral worth. That kind of certainty rarely limits itself to a single target." Cornelius's tail began moving again, tracing patterns in the air as he thought aloud. "If the killer believes they are administering righteous judgment, they would logically continue until their mission was complete."

Melas swore quietly. "Which means everyone at that gala could be a potential target. Anyone guilty of anything the killer considers worthy of execution."

"Not anyone," Cornelius corrected. "Judgment Salt requires consumption. The killer needs access, opportunity, and method. They cannot simply distribute poison randomly—they need to place it where specific targets will ingest it."

"Lucchesi's medication routine," Zeph said. His voice had steadied further, falling into the collaborative pattern of investigation that seemed to ground him. "That was targeted and specific. The killer knew exactly when and how he would consume wine mixed with powder."

"Correct. Which means they studied him. Learned his habits. Waited for optimal opportunity." Cornelius looked at the evidence bag again, those beautiful deadly crystals catching lamplight. "And if they prepared that carefully for one victim, they might be preparing equally carefully for others."

A sound echoed from the corridor beyond the office—distant but clear in the late-night quiet of mostly-empty City Hall.

A scream.

Not the theatrical shriek of manufactured drama. This was genuine terror, raw and immediate.

Melas was already moving, his hand dropping to the truncheon at his belt as he crossed to the door in three long strides. Cornelius spread his wings and launched himself from the desk, gliding after the captain with Zeph close behind. Imelda followed at a more measured pace, her expression unreadable but her body language alert.

The corridor outside was dimly lit, most lamps turned down to conserve fuel. Their footsteps echoed on marble as they followed the source of the scream toward the Rotunda's entrance hall.

A woman stood frozen in the doorway—one of the catering staff based on her simple uniform. Her face was bone-white, one hand pressed to her mouth as if trying to force back further screaming.

She was staring at the wall beside the entrance.

Cornelius dropped to the floor and moved closer, his enhanced vision picking out details in the uncertain lamplight.

Someone had drawn a symbol on the wall. Fresh ink—still wet enough to gleam. The design was simple but precise: a perfect circle containing a stylized eye, its pupil rendered as a vertical slash reminiscent of certain reptilian species. Around the circle's perimeter, text in ancient script that Cornelius recognized from archival documents.

"*Culpa purgata sanguine,*" he read aloud. His voice sounded strange to his own ears—distant and academic even as his heart rate accelerated. "Guilt purged by blood."

Beneath the symbol, in the same careful hand: "Justice comes for all who deserve it."

Melas was already scanning the area, his professional instincts overriding shock. "When was this discovered?"

The catering woman managed to lower her hand from her mouth. "I—just now. I was checking the entrance hall to see if we could start cleaning. The wall was blank when we locked down the building."

"Making this very recent." The captain's weathered face had gone hard. "Within the last three hours."

Cornelius moved closer to the symbol, analyzing the ink composition through his specialized vision. Standard commercial ink, nothing exotic. The application was confident—no hesitation marks, no smudging. Whoever drew this had done so quickly and competently under time pressure.

"This confirms your theory," Imelda said quietly, standing beside him. "This is not murder. This is crusade."

Cornelius stared at the eye symbol, feeling certainty settle into his mind with the weight of documented fact.

They were not hunting an ordinary killer.

They were hunting someone who believed absolutely in their own righteousness. Someone who saw themselves as divine instrument. Someone who had killed once and was promising, with ancient script and fresh ink, to kill again.

The Judge.

And somewhere in this locked building, surrounded by guards and witnesses and official scrutiny, they were waiting to choose their next victim.

# Chapter 9

The symbol was crude.

That was Cornelius's first coherent thought after the initial shock of discovery faded. He stood before the wall, wings slightly spread for balance, and catalogued the image with clinical precision. A perfect circle—well, nearly perfect, with a slight wobble on the eastern quadrant that suggested hasty execution. Within it, a vertical-slit eye rendered in thick strokes. Around the perimeter, the Latin text in what appeared to be the same dark liquid as the eye itself.

Not ink, he realized as his enhanced vision focused on the substance. Wine. Red wine, already beginning to dry at the edges where it had been painted thinnest.

"Touch nothing," Melas ordered, though the command was directed more at the terrified catering worker than at Cornelius. The captain moved closer, his weathered face illuminated by the lamp he had retrieved from a wall sconce. "How long does wine take to dry on stone?"

"That would depend on ambient humidity, air circulation, and the wine's sugar content." Cornelius tilted his head, analyzing the symbol from a different angle. "Given the conditions in this corridor—relatively still air, moderate temperature—between fifteen and forty minutes for surface drying. Complete desiccation would require several hours."

"So this was drawn recently. Within the lockdown window."

"Almost certainly." Cornelius stepped back, mentally measuring the symbol's placement. Approximately five feet from the floor—the height of an average human's reach without stretching. The strokes were confident despite their artistic deficiency, suggesting someone who knew exactly what they intended to draw before they began.

Imelda had moved to examine the text more closely, her ancient eyes tracking the Latin letters with practiced ease. "The calligraphy is poor. Someone with classical education would have formed these characters more precisely."

"Unless they were deliberately obscuring their training," Melas suggested.

"Possible. But unnecessary if one is already concealing identity through secrecy." Imelda straightened, brushing invisible dust from her robes. "This reads like amateur theatrics rather than genuine scholarship."

Cornelius felt something shift in his mind—not quite recognition, but the sense that disparate pieces were beginning to align into coherent pattern. He turned away from the symbol, his tail sweeping in thoughtful arcs as he processed.

"Captain Melas," he said slowly. "Does this symbol not strike you as remarkably convenient?"

The captain's eyebrows raised. "In what sense?"

"In the sense that we have just concluded Lucchesi's killer is using Judgment Salt—an obscure alchemical compound known to very few people—and now we discover theatrical evidence of some moral crusader signing their work." Cornelius gestured toward the wall with one wing. "It is too obvious. Too perfectly aligned with our recent conclusions."

"You think someone is attempting to mislead us?" Imelda's voice carried genuine interest rather than challenge.

"I think someone is attempting to appear more ideologically motivated than they actually are." Cornelius's mind was accelerating now, connecting observations into hypothesis. "Consider the timing. We identify the poison. We theorize about moral judgment and righteous execution. And within thirty minutes, a symbol appears that reinforces exactly that narrative."

Melas had pulled out his notebook, pencil poised. "Continue."

"Whoever drew this wanted us to believe we are dealing with a zealot. Someone on a crusade. Someone who will kill again because they are driven by divine mission or moral certainty." Cornelius moved closer to the symbol again, studying the wine-dark eye. "But actual zealots rarely advertise their presence so obviously. True believers commit their acts and trust in the righteousness of their cause. They do not paint symbols on walls like street criminals marking territory."

"Unless they want credit," Zeph said quietly.

Cornelius glanced back at his intern. The boy was leaning against the corridor wall, his face still too pale, his posture suggesting exhaustion. But his eyes were focused, tracking Cornelius's reasoning.

"Credit for what?" Cornelius asked. "Murder? That is called a confession, and it would be monumentally stupid to confess via cryptic Latin when one has thus far avoided detection."

"People do stupid things when they think they are morally justified." Melas tapped his pencil against the notebook. "I have arrested plenty of criminals who could not resist explaining why their victim deserved death."

"True. But those criminals explained after capture, not before. This..." Cornelius indicated the symbol with a dismissive tail-flick. "This is performance. Misdirection."

Imelda had been silent, her ancient gaze moving between Cornelius and the wall. When she spoke, her voice carried the neutral tone of someone presenting data rather than argument. "What alternative do you propose?"

"I propose that our killer is attempting to disguise personal motive as ideological crusade." Cornelius felt certainty crystallizing in his mind, the satisfaction of pattern recognition that characterized his best analytical work. "We have been approaching this incorrectly. We assumed the Judgment Salt indicated a moral vigilante. But what if it simply indicated someone with access to rare alchemical compounds and a flair for dramatic method?"

"You are suggesting the killer chose Judgment Salt for practical rather than philosophical reasons?" Melas sounded skeptical.

"I am suggesting the killer chose it because it was available and spectacularly effective, and then decided to enhance the mystique by adding theatrical elements." Cornelius began pacing, his thoughts organizing themselves into verbal structure. "Consider Valerian. He has academic training. He worked closely with Lucchesi for years—ample time to learn of obscure compounds in the man's reference materials. He felt exploited, betrayed, morally wronged. When he finally decided to act, he selected a poison that would kill only the guilty, thus justifying his own actions in his own mind."

"The Judgment Salt as psychological reassurance rather than public message," Imelda said thoughtfully.

"Precisely. Valerian needed to convince himself that Lucchesi deserved death, that this was justice rather than murder. The Salt provided that reassurance—if Lucchesi died, it proved his guilt objectively." Cornelius's tail moved faster, describing complex arcs. "But then we began investigating. We identified the compound. We started theorizing about moral crusaders and ongoing campaigns. And Valerian realized he needed to reinforce that narrative, make us waste time hunting for phantom zealots while he remained safely classified as mere assistant rather than ideological killer."

Zeph had straightened slightly, his attention fully engaged despite obvious fatigue. "So you think Valerian painted this? As misdirection?"

"I think it fits his pattern of behavior perfectly. He is clever—he ghostwrote sophisticated manuscripts for years. He understands narrative structure and dramatic tension. And he has proven capacity for deception, hiding his authorship while allowing Lucchesi to claim credit." Cornelius stopped pacing, turning to face Melas directly. "He is also still in this building. Still under our supervision. He had opportunity to slip away briefly and create this symbol while we were occupied with other interviews."

Melas made several quick notations. "He was in the reception room with the other key witnesses during the relevant timeframe."

"Was he watched continuously? Every single moment?" Cornelius watched the captain's expression shift infinitesimally—the slight tightening around the eyes that suggested negative answer. "I thought not. We have been focused on preventing escape, not monitoring internal movement. Someone could excuse themselves to the washroom and be gone for fifteen minutes without raising alarm."

"Several people did," Melas admitted. "I have guards posted at exits, not escorts following suspects through corridors."

"Then Valerian had opportunity." Cornelius felt the theory solidifying, becoming not merely hypothesis but conclusion supported by evidence. "He had means—wine is readily available from the catering supplies. He had motive—creating false trail to protect himself. And he certainly had knowledge—any classically educated scholar could produce that Latin phrase."

Imelda tilted her head slightly. "The phrasing was grammatically correct, if artlessly rendered."

"Exactly my point. Valerian would know the proper conjugation but might deliberately execute it poorly to suggest less sophisticated killer." Cornelius moved back to the symbol, examining it with fresh perspective informed by his theory. "Everything about this is calculated to mislead. The crude execution. The theatrical placement. The timing immediately after our discussion of moral crusades."

"It does align suspiciously well with our recent conclusions," Melas said slowly.

"Because Valerian was in the room when we reached those conclusions." Cornelius's voice carried the weight of certainty now. "Imelda explained Judgment Salt to all of us, including her theory about moral enforcement and righteous execution. Valerian heard every word. He then had several hours to consider how that interpretation might benefit him if we pursued it—and several hours to realize he needed to reinforce it if he wanted to avoid being identified as the logical suspect."

Zeph made a small sound—not quite agreement, not quite protest. Cornelius glanced at him.

"You have objection?"

"Not exactly. It's just..." Zeph rubbed his temple, the gesture suggesting his headache had not fully abated. "Valerian didn't seem like someone planning misdirection when we interviewed him. He seemed terrified."

"As he should be. He committed murder." Cornelius dismissed the concern with a tail-flick. "Terror and calculation are not mutually exclusive states. Many criminals experience genuine fear of consequences while simultaneously executing defensive strategies."

"I guess." Zeph did not sound convinced.

Melas was studying his notes, cross-referencing observations. "Walk me through the complete theory. From beginning to end."

Cornelius felt a surge of satisfaction. This was precisely his preferred mode of operation—organized presentation of evidence leading to inevitable conclusion. He positioned himself where all three humans could see him clearly and began.

"Valerian worked as Fabrizio Lucchesi's personal assistant for five years. During that time, he was systematically exploited. He researched, organized, and ultimately ghostwrote Lucchesi's last two books while receiving only minimal acknowledgment and standard compensation. This was intellectual theft on a profound scale—Valerian created the work, Lucchesi claimed the credit and reaped all associated fame and profit."

"Established motive," Melas noted.

"Further complicated by their prior romantic relationship, which ended when Lucchesi chose a more socially advantageous partner but retained Valerian as assistant. This added personal betrayal to professional exploitation." Cornelius adjusted his spectacles, organizing the next section. "Valerian harbored justifiable resentment. Over time, that resentment metastasized into determination to act. But he needed method that would both kill Lucchesi and psychologically confirm to Valerian himself that such killing was justified."

"The Judgment Salt," Imelda said.

"Precisely. Through his work organizing Lucchesi's research materials, Valerian learned of Judgment Salt's existence and properties. Perhaps he encountered references in rare texts. Perhaps Lucchesi himself had researched the compound for one of his own projects. Regardless, Valerian gained knowledge of a poison that only kills the guilty." Cornelius began pacing again, his movements measured and deliberate. "This was perfect for his purposes. If Lucchesi died from the Salt, it proved objectively that Lucchesi deserved death. It transformed murder into execution. It gave Valerian moral cover for what he planned to do."

"Psychological rationalization," Melas said.

"Indeed. So Valerian acquired or created the compound—either through his own alchemical skill or through outside resources we have not yet identified. He then studied Lucchesi's habits, looking for opportunity to administer it. The medication routine was ideal. Lucchesi regularly mixed powder with wine before major events. Valerian knew this schedule intimately. He had access to Lucchesi's private preparation room. All he needed was correct timing."

Cornelius paused, allowing the sequence to unfold in his mind with crystalline clarity.

"The Solterra Gala provided optimal opportunity. Major public event. Lucchesi would certainly take his medication beforehand. And the public nature of the death would create chaos that might obscure investigation." Cornelius's tail traced sharp angles. "Valerian replaced Lucchesi's medication powder with Judgment Salt. Or perhaps he added the Salt to the powder—we will need to test remaining contents of whatever container held the medication. Lucchesi prepared his pre-speech mixture as usual. Consumed it. And died within seconds, exactly as Judgment Salt would cause in a guilty person."

"Which brings us to tonight's interviews," Melas prompted.

"During which Valerian displayed all the behavioral markers of guilt." Cornelius felt the satisfaction of pieces interlocking. "He provided information freely when it served to establish his character as exploited victim. He showed genuine emotional conflict—hatred mixed with grief—because those feelings were authentic. But when directly questioned about the murder itself, he sneezed."

"The Sphinx tell," Imelda observed.

"Precisely. Sphinxes cannot lie without physical symptoms. When asked if he killed Lucchesi, Valerian sneezed. The immediate interpretation was that he lied when denying the killing—that the sneeze indicated deception." Cornelius paused for effect. "Yes, Zeph correctly noted that the sneeze timing was ambiguous. But ambiguity often indicates sophisticated deception rather than innocence. Valerian is clever enough to layer his responses, creating plausible alternative interpretations that cast doubt on the obvious conclusion."

Zeph opened his mouth as if to speak, then closed it again. His expression was difficult to read.

"So you believe the sneezing did indicate he lied about the killing, despite the timing question?" Melas asked.

"I believe Valerian created enough ambiguity to make himself appear less guilty while still unable to fully conceal his involvement. The sneezes are evidence, but so is his behavior pattern—his intimate knowledge of Lucchesi's schedule, his access to rare alchemical compounds through his research work, his demonstrable motive of intellectual theft combined with personal betrayal." Cornelius's voice gained confidence with each supporting detail. "And now, this theatrical symbol appearing precisely when it would most benefit him by redirecting our investigation toward phantom moral crusaders."

Imelda had been listening with her characteristic patience, but now she raised one hand slightly. "You are certain? This is not hypothesis but conclusion?"

"I am certain the evidence supports this interpretation more strongly than any alternative." Cornelius met her ancient gaze directly. "Could I be wrong? Theoretically, yes. Any conclusion based on incomplete information carries possibility of error. But the probability that I am correct exceeds ninety percent based on available data."

"Ninety percent," Melas repeated dryly. "You have calculated this?"

"I have estimated it based on evidential weight and suspect behavior assessment." Cornelius refused to be embarrassed by precision. "The point is that Valerian represents our strongest suspect by substantial margin. Far stronger than vague theories about zealots we have not even identified."

Melas flipped back through his notebook, reviewing previous pages. "We will need additional evidence. Confession would be ideal, but failing that, we need to place him physically at the scene of poison administration with opportunity to tamper with the medication."

"Which is why we should gather all suspects and witnesses together." Cornelius felt the familiar satisfaction of a puzzle approaching solution. "In the Rotunda. Formal presentation of evidence and logical deduction leading to inevitable conclusion."

The captain looked up sharply. "You want to conduct a drawing-room revelation? Like in detective novels?"

"I want to create psychological pressure that yields confession." Cornelius would not apologize for appreciating elegant methodology. "When confronted with complete logical case demonstrating guilt, many criminals find the burden of maintaining innocence intolerable. They confess to end the tension."

"Or they maintain denial and we appear foolish for conducting theatrical accusations without solid proof," Melas countered.

"Then we arrest Valerian anyway based on circumstantial evidence and continue building the case while he is detained. Either outcome is superior to current state of uncertainty." Cornelius spread his wings slightly, emphasizing his point. "We have kept this building locked down for over three hours. People are exhausted. Patience is wearing thin. We need resolution, and we need it soon."

Melas closed his notebook, his weathered face settling into an expression that suggested reluctant agreement. "If we are going to do this, we do it by my procedures. I present the evidence. You may contribute observations, but I lead the interrogation."

"Acceptable." Cornelius had no particular attachment to who delivered the accusation, only that it be delivered effectively.

"And if Valerian does not confess, we proceed with formal arrest and process him through proper channels. No vigilante justice. No library tribunals." Melas's tone made clear this was non-negotiable.

"I am a librarian, not a vigilante. I have no interest in justice beyond ensuring the guilty party is correctly identified and appropriately detained by legal authorities." Cornelius paused. "Though I reserve the right to pursue intellectual satisfaction through complete understanding of method and motive."

"Naturally." The captain's dry inflection suggested amusement. "Very well. I will have the guards assemble everyone in the Rotunda. Key witnesses and any others still present who might have relevant observations."

"Excellent." Cornelius felt energy returning despite the late hour. There was something invigorating about approaching solution, about seeing pattern emerge from chaos. This was what his mind was built for—imposing order through rigorous analysis.

Melas moved toward the corridor exit, already issuing mental commands that would translate into guard mobilization. Imelda followed more slowly, pausing beside Cornelius.

"You are certain?" she asked quietly.

"As certain as logic permits."

"Logic is tool, not truth." Her ancient eyes held his. "Tools can be misapplied."

"I am aware." Cornelius kept his voice level. "But I am also aware that excessive doubt paralyzes action. At some point, one must commit to interpretation and test it against reality."

"Indeed." Imelda touched his wing gently—a gesture of affection that would have irritated him from anyone else. "Mind you test rather than declare."

Then she too departed, leaving Cornelius alone with Zeph in the dim corridor.

The boy had not moved from his position against the wall. His dark eyes followed Cornelius with an expression that might have been concern or might have been simple exhaustion.

"You disagree with my conclusion," Cornelius said. It was not quite question.

"I don't know enough to disagree." Zeph rubbed his temple again. "It's just... when we talked to Valerian, he was scared. Really scared. The kind of scared where you are trying not to fall apart."

"Murderers frequently experience fear. It is called conscience."

"Maybe." Zeph did not sound convinced. "But it felt wrong. Not like guilty-murderer-wrong. Wrong like... like he was terrified of something bigger than getting caught."

Cornelius felt a flicker of irritation. "Vague intuition is not evidence."

"I know. I'm just saying it felt off." Zeph straightened, pushing away from the wall. "But you are probably right. You usually are about this stuff."

The concession should have been satisfying. Instead, it felt somehow hollow—as if Zeph was agreeing not from conviction but from lack of energy to argue.

"We should proceed to the Rotunda," Cornelius said. "Melas will want us positioned appropriately when the suspects arrive."

"Sure." Zeph fell into step beside him as they moved down the corridor. "Can I ask one thing though?"

"You may ask. I may or may not answer."

"If you are so sure it's Valerian... why make a big theatrical show of it? Why not just have Melas arrest him quietly?"

Cornelius considered the question. The honest answer involved elements of ego that he preferred not to examine too closely—the satisfaction of demonstrating superior reasoning, the pleasure of watching disorder resolve into order through his intervention. But there were also practical considerations.

"Because confession simplifies legal proceedings," he said. "And because cornered criminals sometimes reveal information they did not intend to disclose. Method. Accomplices. Additional evidence. The pressure of formal accusation creates fractures in prepared narrative."

"Makes sense." Zeph was quiet for a moment. Then: "You really think he did it?"

"I think the evidence supports that conclusion far more strongly than alternatives."

"That's not the same as yes."

"It is the same as yes within acceptable margin of theoretical uncertainty." Cornelius's tail twitched with renewed irritation. "Why this continued doubt? You yourself noted the suspicious sneeze timing."

"I noted it was weird, not that it proved guilt." Zeph's voice carried unusual firmness. "And I still think Valerian seemed more scared than calculating. But you know way more about this stuff than I do, so probably I am missing something."

They had reached the Rotunda entrance. Through the archway, Cornelius could see guards moving furniture, creating space for the coming assembly. The covered body of Fabrizio Lucchesi still lay on the platform, a shrouded reminder of what this entire night had been about.

"You are not missing something," Cornelius said quietly. "You are experiencing doubt because you prefer people to be innocent. It is generous instinct but poor analytical practice."

"Maybe." Zeph stared at the covered form. "Or maybe I just really want you to be right. Because if you are not, then we are about to accuse an innocent person of murder in front of everyone."

"I am right." Cornelius said it with absolute confidence, feeling certainty settle through his frame like well-fitted armor. "The evidence is clear. The logic is sound. Valerian killed Lucchesi using Judgment Salt to assuage his own guilt while pursuing revenge for exploitation. Everything else—the theatrical symbol, the moral crusade narrative—is misdirection designed to protect himself."

"Okay." Zeph took a deep breath. "Then let's go prove it."

Cornelius spread his wings and glided into the Rotunda, selecting an elevated position on one of the marble columns where he could observe the entire space. Below, guards ushered witnesses and suspects into arranged seating that faced the platform. Valerian entered looking pale and drawn, his Sphinx features tight with tension. Giovanni Conti followed, radiating irritation. The Karellas family arrived as unified unit. Other witnesses and minor suspects filled remaining spaces.

Melas positioned himself on the platform beside Lucchesi's covered body, his posture that of formal authority. Imelda stood to one side, her silver-braided head slightly bowed as if in meditation.

Zeph found a position near the back, leaning against a column. His face was unreadable in the uncertain lamplight.

Cornelius surveyed the assembly with satisfaction. All the pieces were in place. The puzzle was solved. Now came the elegant demonstration of solution—the methodical presentation of evidence leading to inevitable conclusion.

He did love a proper summing up.

"Thank you all for your patience," Melas began, his voice carrying clearly through the Rotunda. "I know this has been a long and difficult night. But we have made significant progress in understanding what happened to Fabrizio Lucchesi. And it is time to share those conclusions."

The assembled crowd shifted, attention focusing with renewed intensity.

Cornelius settled onto his column perch, tail wrapped neatly around his feet, and prepared to watch his theory transform into demonstrated truth.

The Rotunda had been transformed into something approaching a proper tribunal, though Cornelius noted with private satisfaction that it lacked the formality of a true courtroom. Guards had arranged chairs in semicircular rows facing the platform where Lucchesi's shrouded body still lay. The positioning was deliberate—suspects and witnesses would be forced to look at the evidence of the crime while hearing the accusation.

Cornelius approved. Psychological pressure served investigation as surely as physical evidence.

He had positioned himself on one of the upper gallery columns, where his elevated vantage point would allow observation of every face, every reaction. His tail was wrapped neatly around his feet. His spectacles sat precisely centered on his snout. He had even straightened his bow tie twice to ensure maximum dignified effect.

Everything was arranged. The puzzle was solved. Now came the elegant demonstration.

Below, Captain Melas stood on the platform beside the covered corpse, his weathered face set in professional neutrality. He had agreed to lead the interrogation, but Cornelius knew who had constructed the logical framework. This was his theory. His deduction. His restoration of order to chaos.

The suspects filed in under guard supervision. Cornelius catalogued them with clinical precision.

Giovanni Conti entered first, his academic robes rumpled from hours of confinement. He moved with the irritated energy of someone who considered this entire proceeding beneath his dignity. He took a seat in the front row, crossing his arms.

Chloe Karellas and her mother Irene followed, the young siren's face pale but composed. They sat together, a unified family front that suggested careful coaching. Pavlos Karellas had been separated for additional questioning about his smuggling operation—a small tactical victory that pleased Cornelius's sense of order.

Other minor witnesses filled the remaining seats. The catering supervisor who had discovered the wall symbol. Several servers who had been on duty near the platform. A handful of civic officials who had attended the gala and remained trapped in the lockdown.

And finally, Valerian.

The Sphinx entered slowly, flanked by two guards who maintained careful distance. His leonine features were drawn, the fur around his muzzle looking somehow disheveled despite its natural texture. His hands—human in form despite his otherwise Sphinx body—trembled slightly as he took the seat indicated in the front row, directly facing the platform.

Directly facing Lucchesi's covered body.

Cornelius studied him with professional interest. Valerian looked exhausted. More than exhausted—hollowed out, as if the night had carved something fundamental from his center. His eyes kept drifting to the shrouded form, then jerking away as if the sight caused physical pain.

Guilt, Cornelius concluded. Unmistakable markers of conscience confronting consequence.

Movement at the back of the room drew his attention. Zeph had arrived, slouching against the curved wall near the entrance. Even at this distance, Cornelius could see the boy was unwell. His face was too pale, the shadows under his eyes pronounced even in the uncertain lamplight. He held himself with peculiar stillness, as if movement might shatter something fragile.

The ozone scent reached Cornelius's sensitive nose—faint but present. Another stress episode building.

Cornelius felt a flicker of concern, quickly suppressed. Zeph would endure. The boy was stronger than he credited himself. And once this matter was resolved, once order was restored, they could both rest.

First, the demonstration.

Melas raised one hand, commanding attention. The low murmur of conversation died instantly. Guards stationed at each exit stood at alert posture. The room settled into expectant silence.

"Thank you for your patience," Melas began. His voice carried clearly through the vast space, pitched for authority without aggression. "I know this has been a difficult night for everyone present. The death of Fabrizio Lucchesi was shocking and tragic. But I can now report that we have made significant progress in our investigation."

He paused, letting that settle. Cornelius approved of the pacing. Build anticipation. Allow observers to focus completely.

"We have identified the poison that killed Maestro Lucchesi," Melas continued. "And we have determined both the method of administration and the identity of the person responsible."

A ripple moved through the assembly—sharply indrawn breaths, slight shifts in posture. Cornelius watched faces carefully. Giovanni's expression remained skeptical. The Karellas women showed appropriate surprise but no particular alarm. Others registered varying degrees of shock and horrified fascination.

Valerian had gone completely still, his leonine body frozen in an attitude that might have been prayer or paralysis.

"The poison," Melas said, "was a rare alchemical compound known as Judgment Salt, or *Sal Judicium*. This substance has a unique property. It remains harmless to those without significant guilt. But for those who have committed serious wrongs—acts they themselves know to be morally or legally transgressive—it becomes a rapid and lethal poison."

More murmuring. Cornelius heard the word "guilt" repeated in whispers, saw understanding dawn on various faces. They were beginning to grasp the implication.

Lucchesi had been guilty of something serious enough to trigger the compound.

"This tells us several things about our killer," Melas continued. He had moved to stand directly beside the shrouded body, positioning himself as prosecutor beside the evidence. "First, they had access to extremely rare alchemical knowledge. Second, they chose this specific method for a reason—not simple assassination, but judgment. And third, they had intimate knowledge of Maestro Lucchesi's personal habits, particularly his medication routine."

Cornelius's tail twitched once. This was the foundation, the careful construction of context before the accusation. Well executed.

"Maestro Lucchesi," Melas said quietly, "regularly took a physician-prescribed powder mixed with wine before major public events. This was a private routine, known to very few people. His physician. His household staff. And his personal assistant."

Every eye in the room turned toward Valerian.

The Sphinx made a small sound—not quite speech, more a strangled exhalation. His hands gripped the edge of his seat with white-knuckled intensity.

"Valerian," Melas said, his tone shifting into formal accusation. "You had motive. Maestro Lucchesi exploited you professionally, claiming credit for your intellectual work. He betrayed you personally, ending your romantic relationship for reasons of social advantage while retaining you in a subservient professional position. You spent years watching him profit from your labor, receive acclaim for your writing, build a reputation on foundations you constructed."

Valerian was shaking his head slowly, a repetitive denial that looked almost involuntary.

Cornelius decided it was time to contribute his analysis. He spread his wings slightly, drawing attention to his elevated position.

"You also had means," he said, his voice cutting through the charged atmosphere with academic precision. "Through your work organizing Maestro Lucchesi's research materials, you encountered references to Judgment Salt. Perhaps in one of his rare alchemical texts. Perhaps in documents related to his early theoretical work on aetheric compounds. Regardless, you gained knowledge of a poison that would serve dual purpose—it would kill your target and psychologically justify the killing by proving the victim's guilt."

Valerian's leonine head turned upward, his eyes finding Cornelius on the column. The expression was difficult to parse—horror mixed with something that might have been desperate appeal.

"I did not—" he began, voice cracking.

"You had opportunity," Cornelius continued, overriding the protestation. "You prepared Maestro Lucchesi's schedule. You knew he would take his medication before the speech. You had access to his private preparation room. Replacing or adulterating the powder would have been simple for someone with your position and knowledge."

"No." Valerian's voice was stronger now, edged with desperation. "I hated him, yes. I wanted recognition. But I did not kill him. I would never—"

He sneezed violently. Once, twice, three times in rapid succession.

The room went utterly silent.

Cornelius felt satisfaction settle through his frame. There it was. The biological tell. Sphinxes could not lie without physical symptoms, and Valerian had just sneezed at the precise moment of denial.

"The evidence speaks clearly," Cornelius said. His voice carried the weight of certainty, the calm assurance of logic meeting proof. "Your body betrays the lie even as you speak it. You killed Fabrizio Lucchesi using Judgment Salt administered through his medication. You created the theatrical wall symbol to misdirect investigation toward imagined zealots. And now you sit before us attempting denial while your own physiology contradicts you."

Valerian was weeping. Tears streamed down his leonine face, matting the fur. His breathing came in ragged gasps that might have been the prelude to sobs or screams.

"I did not kill him," he repeated. His voice broke completely. "I hated him. I wanted him to suffer as I suffered. But I did not want him dead. I needed him alive—alive long enough to force him to acknowledge what I had done, to prove to the world that those books were mine. His death accomplishes nothing. It leaves me forever invisible."

Another sneeze punctuated the declaration.

Cornelius's analytical mind registered the timing, cross-referenced it with the content of Valerian's statement. The sneeze had occurred after the emotional claim about needing Lucchesi alive, not after the factual denial of murder.

A small inconsistency. But emotions were often tangled, self-deceptive. Valerian might genuinely believe his rationalizations while still having committed the act. Murderers frequently constructed elaborate psychological justifications.

The theory held. The logic was sound.

Valerian reached for something on the small table beside his chair—Cornelius's enhanced vision identified it as a glass of water, probably provided by guards for the witnesses' comfort during the long night. The Sphinx's hands shook so badly that water sloshed against the sides as he lifted it.

From the back of the room, a sharp sound—halfway between gasp and cry.

Cornelius's attention snapped toward the source.

Zeph had pushed away from the wall. His face was no longer merely pale but bone-white, slicked with sudden sweat. One hand pressed against his temple. His eyes were wide, pupils dilated to the point that they looked almost black.

The ozone scent hit Cornelius like a physical force. Not the faint background presence from before, but overwhelming atmospheric charge—the electrical density that preceded lightning strikes.

"Don't!" Zeph shouted. The word tore from him with desperate urgency. "Valerian, don't drink that!"

But the warning came one second too late.

Valerian had already raised the glass to his lips. Already tilted it back. Already swallowed.

For a frozen moment, nothing happened.

Valerian lowered the glass slowly, confusion replacing terror on his leonine features. He looked at Zeph, then at the glass, then opened his mouth as if to ask a question.

The convulsion hit him like a physical blow.

His entire body went rigid. The glass fell from spasming hands, shattering against marble with crystalline precision. Valerian's mouth opened in a soundless scream, foam already bubbling at the corners. His leonine form jerked backward against the chair with such force that it tipped, spilling him onto the floor.

Someone screamed. Multiple someones. The assembly erupted into chaos—people surging to their feet, guards shouting for order, Melas vaulting from the platform toward the seizing Sphinx.

Cornelius remained frozen on his column perch, wings half-spread in an aborted motion toward flight.

His mind processed with terrible clarity:

The reaction was identical to Lucchesi's death. Same onset speed. Same convulsive pattern. Same foam at the mouth indicating respiratory collapse.

Judgment Salt.

In the water glass.

Prepared and positioned before the assembly. Before the accusation. Before anyone knew Valerian would be sitting in that specific seat.

The logical implications cascaded through Cornelius's thoughts with mechanical inevitability:

If Valerian was poisoned, Valerian was not the poisoner.

If Valerian was a target, Valerian was not the killer.

If Valerian was dying the same way Lucchesi died, then someone else had administered Judgment Salt to both of them.

And if Judgment Salt only killed the guilty, then Valerian—whatever his other crimes of exploitation or ghostwriting—had been telling the truth about not committing murder.

All of which meant Cornelius's perfect theory was catastrophically, mortally wrong.

Melas had reached Valerian's collapsed form, was shouting for the healer, attempting to position the convulsing body for treatment. Imelda appeared from somewhere, her ancient face set in grim lines as she knelt beside the Sphinx. Other guards were trying to restore order, to prevent the panicked assembly from stampeding toward the exits.

Cornelius could not move. His claws gripped the column with rigid force. His wings remained half-extended in useless paralysis.

He had been so certain. Ninety percent probability. The evidence had aligned so perfectly. The motive clear. The means established. The opportunity confirmed. And the Sphinx sneeze—biological proof of deception.

All of it meaningless. All of it worse than meaningless—it had been misdirection that he had accepted blindly, constructed elaborate logic to support, and then announced with absolute authority in front of everyone.

He had accused an innocent person. Had assembled the court, delivered the condemnation, ignored the warnings.

Had ignored Zeph's warning specifically. The boy who said Valerian seemed "scared of something bigger." Who questioned why theatrical demonstration was necessary. Who expressed clear doubt even while deferring to Cornelius's supposed expertise.

Movement at the back of the room registered peripherally. Zeph had sagged against the wall, his face buried in both hands. His shoulders shook—whether from sobs or simply physical collapse from the sensory overload, Cornelius could not determine.

On the floor, Valerian's convulsions were slowing. Not improvement—the terrible stillness of systems shutting down. Imelda's expression confirmed what Cornelius's analytical mind had already concluded.

Another death. Another victim of Judgment Salt.

Which meant another guilty party. Someone else who had committed acts serious enough to trigger the compound's lethal properties.

And it meant the actual killer was still here. Still in this room. Still one step ahead of the investigation.

Still ahead of Cornelius.

The thought felt like physical pain—a sensation he had not experienced since his manifestation from the library's accumulated knowledge. His analytical mind, his pattern recognition, his logical deduction—all the tools he trusted absolutely, that defined his fundamental nature—had failed.

Worse than failed. Had been manipulated. Used against the investigation like a weapon the killer had placed in his claws and aimed at an innocent target.

The killer who was currently watching with satisfaction as chaos consumed the Rotunda. Who had predicted or hoped for exactly this outcome. Who had prepared the poisoned water glass and waited for the trap to spring.

Cornelius forced himself to scan the assembly. Every face was turned toward Valerian's dying form and the cluster of people attempting futile aid. Expressions of shock, horror, fear. No obvious satisfaction. No visible triumph.

But the killer was here. Had to be. Had positioned the glass. Had known or predicted that Valerian would be accused. Had prepared for this specific scenario.

The perfect crime compounded. First Lucchesi, now Valerian. Both guilty of something, both killed by a poison that only confirmed their guilt while making the actual murderer appear righteous.

And Cornelius had helped. Had constructed the very accusation that drove Valerian to reach for the poisoned water. Had assembled the witnesses, created the psychological pressure, forced the sequence of events that led inexorably to this moment.

He had not killed Valerian with his own claws. But his certainty, his arrogance, his absolute conviction in his own intellectual superiority—those had been the weapons that maneuvered the Sphinx into position for execution.

Melas straightened from Valerian's still form. The captain's weathered face looked older suddenly, carved with lines of exhaustion and grim recognition. His gaze swept the assembly, then rose to find Cornelius on his column perch.

Their eyes met across the chaotic space.

Cornelius saw the question forming. Saw Melas's professional mind already pivoting to next steps, new theories, revised approach. The captain would not waste time on recrimination—there was still a killer to catch, still an investigation requiring resolution.

But Cornelius could not move. Could not speak. Could not formulate response or contribute observation or construct hypothesis.

His perfect order had collapsed into chaos. His restoration of truth had cemented lies. His absolute certainty had killed an innocent person.

And somewhere in this locked building, the actual Judge was watching his failure unfold with satisfaction that Cornelius could only imagine but could not, despite all his vaunted analytical power, identify or prevent.

# Chapter 11

# Chapter 11

The screaming had not stopped.

Cornelius remained frozen on his column perch, claws locked into marble that felt suddenly unstable beneath him. Below, the Rotunda had transformed into a churning mass of bodies and noise. Guards shouted contradictory orders. Witnesses surged toward exits or pressed closer to the platform where Valerian lay convulsing. Someone was crying—high, keening sobs that cut through the deeper chaos like a knife through parchment.

His analytical mind continued processing despite everything, cataloguing details with mechanical precision: Imelda kneeling beside Valerian's seizing form, her hands moving in practiced healing gestures. Melas barking commands, trying to establish perimeter and order. The Karellas women still seated but gripping each other's hands with white-knuckled force. Giovanni Conti standing, his face blank with shock.

And Zeph. Still pressed against the back wall. No longer covering his face but watching the scene with an expression Cornelius could not parse from this distance. Not triumph. Not even relief at being proven right.

Something worse. Something that looked almost like pity.

The ozone scent had faded, leaving only the familiar smells of the Rotunda—old stone, lamp oil, the lingering wine-sweetness from Lucchesi's spilled glass. As if atmospheric reality itself was denying what had just occurred.

But Valerian's body told the truth. His convulsions were slowing now, the terrible rigidity giving way to limpness that suggested either stabilization or complete system failure. Foam still flecked his leonine muzzle. His breathing came in shallow, irregular gasps.

Identical presentation to Lucchesi's death. Exactly identical.

Which meant Judgment Salt. Which meant guilt. Which meant Valerian had not been lying when he denied murder, because the Salt would not have killed him if he had committed that particular sin. Which meant everything Cornelius had concluded, every logical inference he had constructed and announced with absolute certainty, had been wrong.

Not merely incomplete. Not slightly miscalibrated. Catastrophically, mortally wrong.

He had assembled this tribunal. Had positioned Valerian in that specific chair. Had created the psychological pressure that drove the Sphinx to reach for water. Had ignored Zeph's warnings and Imelda's cautions and his own brief flicker of doubt about the sneeze timing because the pattern had been so elegant, the solution so satisfyingly complete.

His ninety percent certainty had killed an innocent person.

No. Not killed. Valerian still breathed, however shallowly. Still existed in that terrible space between life and death where healing might yet prevail.

But Cornelius had placed him there as surely as if he had administered the poison personally.

"Drake." Melas's voice cut through the chaos and Cornelius's spiraling thoughts. "Drake, get down here."

Cornelius tried to respond. Found his throat would not produce sound. His wings remained frozen in their half-spread position, his tail rigid against the column.

"Now, Drake." Not shouting. Worse than shouting—the flat command tone that expected immediate obedience.

His body moved before conscious thought engaged. Wings folding, claws releasing marble, controlled descent to the platform. Landing felt wrong, as if gravity itself had shifted parameters and he could no longer trust basic physics.

Melas was there immediately, one weathered hand closing around Cornelius's midsection and lifting him bodily from the platform. Not gently. Not with particular care for dignity or comfort.

"Office," the captain said. "Now."

Cornelius did not protest as he was carried through the crowd. People moved aside without being asked, their faces blurring into undifferentiated expressions of shock and fear. The guards had established a corridor from platform to exit, keeping the assembly from complete stampede.

Behind them, Imelda's voice rose in careful incantation. Healing work. The ancient syllables that shaped flesh and mended damage. Whether she could reverse Judgment Salt's effects remained unknown. Whether Valerian would survive the attempt remained unknown.

Whether it mattered remained unknown, because Cornelius had already condemned him in front of everyone present.

The Mayor's office was dark when Melas shouldered through the door. No lamps lit, no preparation made for their return. The captain deposited Cornelius on the desk with enough force to rattle the inkwell, then moved to the lamp and struck flame with movements that suggested barely controlled violence.

Light bloomed. The familiar office resolved from shadow—same carved desk, same civic maps, same orderly arrangements that had seemed reassuring hours ago. Now it felt like stage dressing, false comfort designed to mask fundamental disorder.

Melas stood by the desk, his weathered face illuminated from below by the lamp. The shadows carved his features into harsh angles, aging him a decade. His hands gripped the desk edge.

"What," he said with terrible quietness, "did you just do?"

Cornelius's throat worked. No sound emerged.

"That was not rhetorical question, Drake. I am asking you to explain the sequence of events that led to a second poisoning in my locked-down crime scene."

"I—" His voice sounded foreign. Thin. Uncertain. "I concluded that Valerian was the killer based on available evidence. Motive, means, opportunity. The Sphinx physiological response indicating—"

"You concluded wrong." Melas's knuckles were white against dark wood. "And your wrongness just got someone poisoned during an official tribunal that you insisted on staging."

"The logical framework was sound." Even as he said it, Cornelius knew how hollow it sounded. How defensive. "The evidence supported—"

"The evidence supported what you wanted it to support because you love being right more than you love being careful." Melas pushed away from the desk, pacing to the window and back. "I trusted your reasoning. I let you build that case. I stood up there and presented your accusations as fact. And now we have a second victim who may or may not survive the night."

"He is not dead." The words emerged before Cornelius could evaluate their utility. "Imelda is skilled. If anyone can reverse the effects—"

"That is not the point!" Melas's palm hit the desk with enough force to make the lamp jump. "The point is that we—that I—conducted a public accusation of an innocent person and created exactly the circumstances that allowed the actual killer to strike again. In our secure location. Under our supervision. While we were too busy being clever to notice what was actually happening."

Silence stretched between them. Cornelius's tail lay absolutely still. His wings remained folded tight against his body.

"You told me you were ninety percent certain," Melas said finally. His voice had dropped back to dangerous quietness. "Do you remember that? Ninety percent probability that Valerian was our killer."

"Yes."

"And I believed you. Because you are Library Dragon. Because you have served as consultant on difficult cases before. Because everyone says Cornelius Drake sees patterns no one else can see, makes deductions no one else can make." Melas's expression was unreadable. "I trusted your ninety percent."

"The trust was misplaced." The words tasted like ashes. "I was wrong."

"You were worse than wrong. You were arrogant." Melas moved to the office door, opened it slightly. The sounds of ongoing chaos filtered through—running footsteps, shouted orders, someone weeping. "And your arrogance just became my problem, because now I have to explain to the Mayor how we went from one dead scholar to one dead scholar and one dying Sphinx, all while the actual murderer remains free."

"I did not intend—"

"Intent does not matter. Results matter." Melas turned back, his face carved with exhaustion. "And the result is that you are done with this investigation. Finished. You will return to your library and remain there until I say otherwise."

The words should have felt like relief. Should have offered escape from this disaster.

Instead they felt like confirmation of complete failure.

"Captain." Cornelius forced his voice to steadiness. "The real killer is still here. Still in this building. They prepared that poisoned glass. They knew or predicted that we would accuse Valerian. They used our logic against us."

"I am aware." Melas's tone suggested this observation contributed nothing useful. "Which is why I am taking different approach going forward. No more elegant theories. No more theatrical confrontations. We are going back to basics. Guard every witness. Check every cup and glass. Process every person through formal interview and detention if necessary."

"But—"

"You are done, Drake." Melas's weathered face was set. "I appreciate your previous assistance. I even acknowledge that some of your observations were valuable before tonight. But you just demonstrated that your methods are dangerous, and I cannot afford another catastrophe."

Movement in the doorway drew both their attention. A guard stood there, young woman with Harbor Watch insignia.

"Captain. The healer says the Sphinx is stable. Unconscious but breathing. She recommends transport to the infirmary for continued treatment."

Melas nodded shortly. "Make it happen. Full guard escort. No one approaches him except authorized medical staff."

The guard saluted and departed. Her footsteps retreated down the corridor.

Stable. Not dead. The relief was profound and entirely insufficient to address the magnitude of what Cornelius had done.

"At least he survived," Cornelius said quietly.

"He survived being poisoned with Judgment Salt." Melas's voice carried no softness. "Which means he is genuinely guilty of something serious enough to trigger the compound. We just proved he is not guilty of Lucchesi's murder, but he is guilty of something."

The implication settled through Cornelius's analytical mind. "You intend to charge him anyway."

"I intend to detain him for his own protection and for further investigation." Melas returned to the desk, pulled out the chair, sat heavily. "Once he is conscious and capable of statement, we will determine what he is actually guilty of. But yes, given that Judgment Salt only affects those with serious transgression, he has committed some crime worth pursuing."

"But not murder. Not this murder." Cornelius's tail twitched once. "Charging him with Lucchesi's death would be—"

"Wrong. I know." Melas rubbed his face with both hands. "But I need to give the Mayor something. Some answer. Some sense that we have not completely lost control of this situation. And a guilt-proven suspect who survives his own attempted suicide via the same poison that killed our victim is... politically convenient."

The words hit like physical impact. "You would charge an innocent person to satisfy political pressure."

"I would detain a demonstrably guilty person—guilty of something—while investigating whether he had accomplice or additional motive we have not yet uncovered." Melas's eyes were hard. "And before you climb onto moral high ground, remember that you are the one who publicly accused him of murder an hour ago. This is cleanup. Damage control. Making sure the actual killer does not claim any more victims while we figure out what actually happened."

Cornelius had no response. The logic was sound. Politically expedient. Professionally defensible.

And completely, utterly wrong in exactly the way his own accusation had been wrong—prioritizing neat resolution over messy truth.

"You see the problem," Melas said quietly. It was not question.

"Yes."

"Good. Then you understand why you are removed from this case. Because I cannot afford another instance of clever reasoning leading to disaster." The captain pulled paper toward him, uncapped his pen. "I am going to draft charges for attempted suicide by poison, with investigation ongoing for conspiracy to commit murder. It gives me legal ground to hold Valerian, protects him from the actual killer, and satisfies the Mayor's need for progress. It is not truth. But it is stability."

"Stability built on false foundation." Cornelius's voice was hollow.

"Better than chaos built on arrogant certainty." Melas began writing, his pen scratching across paper with methodical precision. "You should go. There is side exit through the records corridor. Avoid the Rotunda. I will send word when the lockdown is officially lifted, but you are free to leave now."

Dismissed. Expelled. Removed from investigation he had wanted to avoid in the first place but had inserted himself into with absolute confidence in his ability to restore order.

Cornelius spread his wings. Folded them again. The movement felt purposeless.

"Captain Melas."

"What." Not looking up from his writing.

"I was wrong. About Valerian. About the method. About—" Everything. The word lodged in his throat. "I apologize for the harm caused."

Melas's pen stopped moving. He looked up, his weathered face unreadable.

"I know you are. But apology does not undo the damage." He returned to writing. "Go home, Drake. Return to your books. Leave justice to those of us who understand that being right is less important than being careful."

The words were dismissal and condemnation both. Cornelius had nothing to offer in response.

He flew from the desk to the doorframe, then to the corridor beyond. The records passage stretched ahead, dark and empty. Behind him, Melas continued writing, the scratch of pen on paper providing rhythm to Cornelius's retreat.

The corridor was blessedly deserted. Everyone was occupied with the aftermath—securing Valerian for transport, calming the assembled witnesses, establishing new order after Cornelius's elegant theory had shattered existing structure.

He flew rather than walked, needing the physical exertion even though the distance was minimal. His wings moved with mechanical precision. His navigation required no thought—this was City Hall, civic building he had visited dozens of times for various archival consultations.

The side exit appeared ahead, unmarked door that led to service alley. Cornelius landed, pressed the release bar with one foreclaw, and emerged into night air.

The alley was quiet. Dark stone walls rising on either side. The smell of kitchen waste from bins awaiting morning collection. Above, a narrow strip of sky showed stars—distant points of light that had witnessed this entire disaster with complete indifference.

He should return to the Library. Should find Imelda once she finished with Valerian and report his removal from the investigation. Should resume his normal duties—cataloguing, organizing, maintaining the orderly systems that defined his existence and purpose.

Should stop thinking about Valerian's terrified face. About Zeph's warning coming too late. About his own certainty crumbling into ash and taking an innocent person's freedom with it.

The signed first edition was still in the Mayor's office. He had left it there during the tribunal assembly, too focused on his elegant demonstration to remember the rare book that had started this entire night.

Appropriate, somehow. Lucchesi's inscription about knowledge and truth now sat in the same room where Melas was drafting false charges to satisfy political necessity. Both artifacts of comfortable lies disguised as rigorous certainty.

Cornelius stood in the alley, wings folded, tail still. The night was quiet except for distant sounds of the city—occasional voice, echoing footsteps on stone, the eternal background rhythm of settlement that never quite slept.

He had failed. Had been wrong in precisely the way that caused maximum harm. Had ignored warnings and dismissed doubts and constructed perfect logic that proved perfectly false.

And somewhere in the locked building behind him, the actual killer was free. Still unidentified. Still dangerous. Still one step ahead of investigation that had been too clever for its own good.

Cornelius spread his wings and flew toward the Library, leaving behind the scene of his greatest intellectual disaster and the book that now felt like monument to fraud.

Behind him, City Hall continued its chaos. Ahead, the Library waited—silent, orderly, safe.

Exactly where he should have remained all along.

# Chapter 12

# Chapter 12

The corridors beyond the Rotunda blurred together. Zeph kept one hand against the wall as he walked, letting cool stone guide him through the maze of City Hall's service passages. His headache had faded to a dull throb behind his left eye—not gone, never really gone these days, but manageable if he didn't think too hard about it.

He'd left the chaos behind. The guards shouting orders. The witnesses crying or demanding answers. Captain Melas trying to restore some kind of order while Valerian was carried off on a stretcher, still breathing but barely.

Zeph had tried to warn him. Had felt that horrible electric buildup in his skull, that certainty that something was about to go very, very wrong. And he'd been too late. Again.

The story of his whole stupid night.

His legs felt like they belonged to someone else. Each step required conscious effort, as if he'd forgotten how walking worked and had to reinvent it from scratch. The ozone smell was gone now—it always faded after the worst passed—but he could still taste metal at the back of his throat.

He needed to find Sophia. Needed to explain why he'd shouted like that, why he'd been standing at the back instead of sitting with her, why he looked half-dead and probably smelled like he'd been struck by lightning.

Needed to explain the unexplainable, basically.

Great plan.

The service corridor opened into a wider hallway—still utilitarian, still bare stone and exposed beams, but with higher ceilings. A few oil lamps flickered in wall sconces, casting more shadow than light. Zeph's footsteps echoed against the floor.

Movement ahead made him stop.

Sophia stood near a recessed doorway, her dark hair escaping its careful arrangement, her formal dress looking wilted despite the expensive fabric. She had her arms wrapped around herself, shoulders hunched in a way that made her look smaller than usual.

When she heard his footsteps, her head jerked up. Her expression cycled through relief, anger, and exhaustion in the space of a breath.

"Zeph." Her voice was flat. Not the warm greeting he'd hoped for. Not even the sharp anger he'd expected. Just... tired.

"Hey." He stopped a few feet away, suddenly unsure if he should close the distance. "I was looking for you."

"Were you." Not a question. She pressed one hand to her forehead, fingers massaging her temple. "Or were you looking for somewhere quiet to have another headache?"

The words stung more than they should have. Probably because they were fair.

"That's not—" He swallowed. Tried again. "I wanted to make sure you were okay. After everything that happened in there."

"After the tribunal fell apart? After someone nearly died in front of everyone?" Sophia's laugh had no humor in it. "After you screamed at a suspect not to drink water and somehow turned out to be right?"

"I didn't—" Zeph's head throbbed. He winced, hated himself for wincing. "I just knew something was wrong. I can't explain how, but—"

"You never can." Sophia dropped her hand, and he saw how red her eyes were. She'd been crying. Recently. "Explain, I mean. It's always 'I don't know' or 'I can't help it' or 'it just happens.' Do you have any idea how that sounds?"

"Like I'm making excuses." His voice came out quieter than intended.

"Like you're not even trying." She moved away from the wall, her formal shoes clicking against stone. "I spent three hours tonight explaining to my mother why you disappeared from our introduction. Three hours, Zeph. And that was before the murder and the chaos and everything else. Before you screamed in the middle of a formal tribunal and somehow saved someone's life while looking like you were about to pass out."

Zeph's hands clenched at his sides. "I didn't ask to—"

"To what? To ruin every important moment we have together?" Sophia's composure cracked, voice rising. "Because that's the pattern, isn't it? Every time something matters—really matters—you have a headache. Or you need air. Or you disappear to the washroom and don't come back for an hour."

"That's not fair."

"Fair?" She stared at him. "You know what my mother said after you ran off? She said I shouldn't waste time on someone who clearly doesn't value our family enough to endure a ten-minute conversation. And my father—he didn't even look at me for the rest of the night. Just sat there with that disappointed expression, like I'd brought home a stray dog that wouldn't stop tracking mud through the house."

The comparison hit like a fist. Zeph felt his face heat, shame and anger mixing in his chest.

"I'm not a dog," he said.

"I know that." Sophia's voice cracked. "But they don't. They see a library intern who can't hold a basic conversation, who makes their daughter look foolish for caring about him, who shows up to formal events and then vanishes at the first sign of pressure."

"It's not pressure, it's—" How could he explain? The way crowds made his skin feel too tight? The way loud voices scraped against the inside of his skull? The electric buildup that meant danger was coming, that someone was about to get hurt, that he needed to pay attention right now or people would die?

He couldn't. Because he didn't understand it himself.

"It's what?" Sophia asked. "A medical condition that no healer can find? A sensitivity that only affects you at the worst possible times? Or is it just that you don't want to be there?"

"Of course I want to be there." The words burst out before he could stop them. "I wore that stupid formal jacket. I memorized facts about your family's mosaics. I practiced what to say a dozen times with Cornelius. I tried, Sophia. I really tried."

"I know." Her shoulders sagged. "That's the worst part. I know you try. But trying isn't enough when you physically cannot function in the spaces I need you to function in."

The corridor felt colder suddenly. Zeph wrapped his arms around himself, mirroring Sophia's defensive posture.

"So what are you saying?" he asked.

Sophia looked at him. Really looked, like she was trying to memorize his features. When she spoke again, her voice was soft. Gentle. Which somehow made it worse.

"I'm saying that I'm exhausted. I'm saying that I spent tonight being questioned by the City Watch about a murder I didn't commit, watching you save someone's life in the most dramatic way possible, and then explaining to my parents—again—why the boy I'm dating is currently helping investigate a crime instead of sitting beside me like a normal partner would."

"I didn't—"

"Choose to help investigate. I know." She held up one hand. "But you did anyway. Because that's what you do. When there's a mystery or a puzzle or something that needs your specific kind of attention, you're there. You're focused. You're competent. You're not the person who needs to leave every ten minutes."

Zeph's throat felt tight. "Are you saying I care more about books than I do about you?"

"No." Sophia shook her head. "I'm saying you do better with books than you do with people. Including me. And I don't know if that's something that can change, or if I'm asking you to be someone you're not."

The admission hung between them. Zeph wanted to argue. Wanted to promise he could change, could be better, could learn to handle her world if she just gave him more time.

But the words stuck.

Because she was right. He'd been miserable from the moment he'd arrived at the gala. Had spent the entire night fighting headaches and crowd-induced panic and the constant fear that he'd say something wrong. The only time he'd felt remotely useful was when he'd been analyzing evidence with Cornelius. When he'd been using his brain instead of trying to make small talk about tile patterns and shipping contracts.

"I don't fit," he said finally. "In your world. With the Tile Families and the formal dinners and the politics. I don't fit, and I don't know if I ever will."

Sophia's eyes welled up. She blinked hard, forcing the tears back.

"I know," she whispered.

The confirmation hurt worse than any accusation.

"My mother wants to postpone introducing you to the extended family," Sophia continued. Her voice had gone flat again, like she was reciting facts for a particularly unpleasant report. "Indefinitely. Until you're more... stable."

"Stable." The word tasted bitter.

"Her word, not mine." Sophia twisted her hands together. "But Zeph, she's not entirely wrong. You need to figure out what's happening with you. These headaches, the sensitivity, whatever it is that makes you shut down in certain situations—you need answers. Real answers. Not just 'I don't know' and hoping it gets better."

"And until then?"

Sophia closed her eyes. When she opened them again, they were dry but devastated.

"Until then, I think we need space. Both of us. I need to deal with my family and the fallout from tonight. You need to deal with... whatever's happening with you. And we need to stop pretending that trying harder will magically fix this."

Space. The word hung in the air like a death sentence dressed up as a temporary solution.

"Is this a breakup?" Zeph asked. His voice sounded distant to his own ears.

"I don't know." Sophia's composure finally shattered. One tear escaped, tracking down her cheek. "I don't want it to be. But I can't keep doing this. Defending you to my family while not understanding what I'm defending. Watching you suffer at events that should be enjoyable. Feeling like a liability—"

She stopped. The word had slipped out accidentally, Zeph could tell. But it was out now, floating between them.

Liability.

The same word Captain Melas had probably used for Cornelius. The same concept that Sophia's parents clearly held about Zeph. The fundamental truth that he made things harder, not easier. That his presence caused problems instead of solving them.

He was a liability. To Sophia's family. To Sophia's reputation. Maybe even to Sophia herself.

The headache pulsed behind his eye, a dull reminder of all the ways his body betrayed him at the worst moments.

"Okay," he said.

Sophia blinked. "Okay?"

"You're right. You need space. I need..." What? Answers he didn't have? A different body that didn't fall apart under pressure? A personality that fit better with tile mosaics and formal dinners? "To figure things out. So let's do that."

"Zeph—"

"No, it's fine." He took a step backward. The distance felt important suddenly. Like if he stayed too close, he'd say something he'd regret. Or worse, he'd try to talk her out of this when she was clearly, painfully right about everything. "You should get back to your family. They're probably wondering where you are."

"What about you?"

"I'll figure it out." Another step back. His heel hit the wall behind him. "I'm good at figuring things out. Just not the social stuff, apparently."

Sophia's face crumpled. "I don't want to hurt you."

"I know." And he did. That was the worst part. She wasn't being cruel. She was being honest. Which hurt so much more. "But this hurts anyway. So maybe just... let me go. Before we say anything else we can't take back."

She nodded. Wrapped her arms tighter around herself. Looked like she wanted to say something more but couldn't find the words.

Zeph turned and walked away before she could try.

His legs moved on autopilot, carrying him deeper into the service corridors. Away from the Rotunda. Away from Sophia. Away from the disaster that tonight had become.

The voices in his head were loud now. All the things he should have said. All the ways he could have defended himself better. All the promises he could have made about trying harder, being better, figuring out the headache situation once and for all.

But none of it would have mattered. Because Sophia was right. He didn't fit. Couldn't fit. Wouldn't fit no matter how many facts he memorized or how many formal jackets he wore.

He was a library intern who ate noodles from questionable street vendors and got electric headaches before people got poisoned. Not exactly Tile Family son-in-law material.

The corridor opened into a junction with three possible directions. Zeph stopped, suddenly unsure where he was going. The service exit was... left? Or was it straight ahead?

Did it matter? He could just leave. Walk out whatever door led outside. Go back to his tiny rented room above the bakery. Sleep for twelve hours and then decide if he was going to quit the internship or just pretend tonight never happened.

Quitting seemed easier. Cleaner. He could find work somewhere else. Somewhere that didn't involve murder investigations and Tile Family politics and dragons who expected him to be useful when he clearly wasn't.

Somewhere he could be a liability in peace.

The thought should have been comforting. Freedom from expectations. From constant failure. From watching people look at him with disappointment or pity or thinly veiled contempt.

Instead it just felt hollow.

Zeph chose the left corridor. His footsteps echoed against stone, the only sound in the empty passage. The oil lamps were spaced farther apart here, leaving pools of shadow between circles of dim light.

He turned a corner and stopped.

There was a bench built into an alcove. Simple stone, probably meant for guards to rest between shifts. And sitting on that bench, looking smaller than Zeph had ever seen him, was Cornelius.

The dragon wasn't perched. Wasn't posed with wings arranged for maximum dignified effect. Wasn't even wearing his usual expression of haughty academic superiority.

He just sat. Slumped, actually, with his wings hanging loose and his tail curled limply beside him. His spectacles sat crooked on his snout, like he'd put them on without his usual careful precision. The bow tie was rumpled.

He looked like a prop that had been used for a play and then discarded in the backstage area. Forgotten. Unwanted.

The word came back, unbidden. Liability.

Captain Melas had kicked Cornelius off the investigation. Zeph had been there for part of it, had heard the anger in the captain's voice. Had seen the way Cornelius went absolutely still, the way his wings froze mid-spread.

The dragon had been wrong. Catastrophically wrong. And someone had nearly died because of it.

But Cornelius had been trying to help. Had been using all his knowledge and logic and pattern-recognition to solve the puzzle. Had genuinely believed he was restoring order.

He'd just been wrong.

Like Zeph had been wrong to think he could function at a formal gala. Like he'd been wrong to think memorizing facts about mosaics would make him fit into Sophia's world. Like he'd been wrong about a lot of things tonight.

Two liabilities, Zeph thought. One tiny dragon who loved being right more than being careful. One headache-prone intern who couldn't handle an introduction to his girlfriend's parents.

Ex-girlfriend's parents, probably.

Zeph stood at the edge of the lamplight, watching Cornelius sit in miserable silence. He could keep walking. Could head for that exit. Could leave City Hall and the investigation and all of it behind.

Could let the dragon sit alone in the dark, processing his failure without witnesses.

But the thing was, Zeph knew what that felt like. The sitting alone part. The processing failure part. The being a liability part.

And it sucked.

He stepped into the alcove. His footsteps announced his presence, but Cornelius didn't look up.

"Hey," Zeph said.

Cornelius's tail twitched. A barely-there acknowledgment.

Zeph sat down on the bench. The stone was cold through his formal pants. He leaned back against the wall, matching Cornelius's slumped posture.

"Captain Melas is an ass," he said finally.

That got a reaction. Cornelius's head turned slightly, one golden eye visible behind crooked spectacles.

"Captain Melas is correct," the dragon said. His voice was quiet. None of the usual precise enunciation. "My certainty resulted in harm. My methods proved dangerous. I am—" He stopped. Started again. "I was wrong."

"Yeah." Zeph didn't see the point in arguing. "But you were trying to help."

"Intention does not mitigate consequence."

"Maybe not. But it should count for something." Zeph rubbed his face with both hands, exhaustion hitting him in waves. "Sophia just told me I'm basically too broken to meet her extended family. Said I need to figure out what's wrong with me before we can keep dating. Which is basically a breakup with extra steps."

Cornelius was quiet for a moment. Then, "I am sorry."

"Yeah, well. She's not wrong either." The admission hurt, but it was true. "I can't function at those events. I tried, and I failed, and honestly I don't know if I can ever be what she needs."

Another silence. Somewhere in the distance, voices echoed. The investigation continuing without them.

"I was considering returning to the Library permanently," Cornelius said. His tail curled tighter. "Restricting myself to archival work. Declining future investigative consultations. I am evidently not suited for fieldwork."

Zeph thought about that. About Cornelius permanently hidden in the Library stacks. About himself finding some different job, maybe in a different city entirely. Both of them retreating from the world because the world had made it clear they didn't quite fit.

It would be easier. Safer. Less painful than constantly trying and failing.

But it also felt like giving up.

"Or," Zeph said slowly, "we could accept that we're both kind of a mess and keep going anyway."

Cornelius's head tilted, curiosity breaking through dejection. "Explain your reasoning."

"I don't have reasoning. I have spite." Zeph leaned his head back against the wall, staring at the stone ceiling. "Sophia called me a liability. Melas probably called you one too. And they're both right, technically. But screw that. I don't want to be the guy who quits because things got hard."

"You are suggesting we continue despite demonstrated incompetence?"

"I'm suggesting that two liabilities are better than one." Zeph looked at the dragon. "You know stuff I don't. I see stuff you don't. Yeah, we both screwed up tonight. But we also helped. You figured out the Judgment Salt thing. I warned Valerian before he could drink enough to die. That's not nothing."

Cornelius adjusted his spectacles with one claw, a ghost of his usual fastidious gesture. "The investigation proceeded adequately before my involvement. Captain Melas is competent."

"Captain Melas is tired and overworked and dealing with politics we don't have to deal with." Zeph felt something solidifying in his chest. Not quite hope. Not yet. But maybe the foundation for it. "There's still a killer in this building. And yeah, you got the Valerian thing wrong. But you were right about the Judgment Salt. Right about it being calculated. Right about a lot of stuff."

"Being partially correct is insufficient when the error results in near-fatal consequences."

"Okay, but sitting here feeling sorry for yourself is also insufficient." Zeph stood up. His legs protested, exhausted and sore. "Look, I don't know if we can actually help. Maybe we're both just liability-prone disasters who should stick to books and avoid people. But we're here. We know stuff. And I'm pretty sure Captain Melas doesn't have anyone who can taste the air before something goes wrong."

That was the first time he'd said it out loud. The thing he couldn't explain to Sophia or healers or anyone else. The knowing.

Cornelius looked at him with both eyes now, analytical focus returning to his features.

"You warned Valerian before you could have logically known the water was poisoned," he said carefully.

"Yeah."

"And you have experienced similar... premonitions before. The headaches. The ozone scent. The physical symptoms that precede incidents."

"Yeah." Zeph's face heated. "I know it sounds crazy—"

"It sounds diagnostic." Cornelius straightened on the bench, wings shifting into their usual precise position. "We should document the pattern. Cross-reference with known magical conditions. There may be literature on precognitive sensitivity or danger-sensing abilities."

"Or I'm just weird and broken."

"Those categories are not mutually exclusive." But Cornelius's voice had lost its hollowness. He was thinking again. Puzzling. Being himself. "However, 'broken' implies malfunction. Perhaps your condition is simply unidentified functionality."

Zeph felt something unknot in his chest. Not quite hope. Not yet. But something.

"So we're doing this?" he asked. "Staying? Helping?"

Cornelius was quiet for a moment. Then he spread his wings, shook himself once, and straightened his bow tie with careful precision.

"Captain Melas removed me from official involvement," he said. "He said nothing about independent observation."

"Pretty sure he meant for you to go home."

"I am aware of what he meant. However, I am also aware that his investigation would benefit from analysis he currently lacks." Cornelius's tail swished once. "And you are correct. Two liabilities may prove more useful than one."

Zeph grinned despite everything. "You just quoted me. That's basically admitting I was right about something."

"I admitted no such thing. I merely acknowledged the pragmatic value of continued collaboration." But there was something in Cornelius's tone that might have been humor. "Now. Where is the nearest access to City Hall's records storage? If we are to investigate independently, we will require documentation."

"You're going to break into the records room?"

"I am going to conduct research in municipal archives that are technically accessible to Library personnel." Cornelius launched from the bench, gliding to Zeph's shoulder. His weight was substantial but somehow comforting. "That is entirely different from breaking in."

"If you say so." Zeph started walking back the way he'd come. Away from the exit. Back toward the heart of City Hall and the investigation and all the complicated disaster the night had become.

Sophia was right about him. Cornelius was a mess. Melas probably should have kicked them both out.

But they were here. They knew things. And maybe that was enough.

Or maybe they'd fail again. Maybe Zeph would get another headache at exactly the wrong moment. Maybe Cornelius would construct another perfect theory that turned out to be perfectly wrong.

But at least they wouldn't fail alone.

"For the record," Cornelius said from his shoulder perch, "your warning did save Valerian's life. Partial success is still preferable to complete failure."

"You're just saying that because you feel guilty."

"I am saying it because it is accurate." The dragon's weight shifted as he adjusted his position. "Though I do also feel considerable guilt. Both things can be true simultaneously."

Zeph navigated another turn, heading toward where he thought the records storage was located. "So what's the plan? We find proof of who did it and hand it to Melas?"

"We gather information. We observe. We document." Cornelius's claws gripped Zeph's shoulder carefully, not quite tight enough to hurt. "And we do not announce conclusions until we are considerably more than ninety percent certain."

"That's pretty much the opposite of your usual approach."

"Yes. Well." The dragon's voice went quiet again. "Perhaps it is time I revised my methodology."

They walked through the dim corridors together. Two liabilities. One tiny dragon and one headache-prone intern. Heading back toward the investigation that had already gone wrong so many times.

But heading back anyway.

Because maybe that was what mattered. Not being perfect. Not fitting in. Not even being right.

Just showing up and trying again.

Even when it hurt.

# Chapter 13

# Chapter 13

Footsteps echoed from the junction ahead. Measured. Heavy. The distinctive rhythm of someone who had walked too many corridors in too many bad situations.

Cornelius recognized Captain Melas before the man fully entered the lamplight. His weathered features looked worse than they had in the Mayor's office—darker shadows under his eyes, deeper lines bracketing his mouth. His uniform jacket hung open, revealing ink stains on his shirt where his pocket had leaked.

The captain stopped at the bench. Looked down at both of them. His expression was unreadable.

"Still here," he said.

It was not quite an accusation. Not quite a question. Cornelius could not determine which would have been preferable.

"Yes," Cornelius said. The word emerged small. Insufficient. He cleared his throat and tried again. "We were... discussing next steps."

"Were you." Melas pulled a wooden chair from the wall—one of several scattered alcove furniture pieces meant for guard rest periods—and sat down with the careful movements of someone whose joints protested every shift in position. "And what steps did you conclude were appropriate after being removed from an active investigation?"

Zeph shifted beside Cornelius. The bench creaked. "We were thinking about going to the records storage. To research."

"Research what, exactly?"

"Magical conditions that present as precognitive sensitivity," Cornelius said. His tail curled tighter against the stone. "Zeph's warning about the poisoned water was not random. There is a pattern to his episodes. One that warrants formal documentation and cross-reference."

"That is what you are researching." Melas's tone suggested profound skepticism. "The intern's headaches. Not the murder investigation I explicitly told you to leave alone."

"The two subjects may be related," Cornelius said. "If Zeph possesses some form of danger-sensing ability, understanding its parameters could prove relevant to—"

"No." Melas held up one hand. "Stop. I do not have energy for parsing your justifications right now."

Silence settled over the alcove. Somewhere distant, a door slammed. Voices rose and faded. The investigation continuing without them.

"How is Valerian?" Zeph asked quietly.

"Stable. Unconscious. Imelda says he should wake within a few hours, barring complications." Melas rubbed his face with both hands. "At which point I will question him about what he is actually guilty of, since the Judgment Salt proved he carries serious transgression even if he did not kill Lucchesi."

"You are still planning to file charges," Cornelius said.

"I am planning to do my job. Which includes detaining suspects who demonstrate clear evidence of criminality." Melas dropped his hands. "The warrants will be ready within the hour. Attempted suicide by poison. Conspiracy to commit murder pending further investigation. Obstruction of justice if I can make it stick."

"But he is innocent." The words burst out before Cornelius could evaluate their strategic value. "Of this murder. The Salt proved—"

"The Salt proved he is guilty of something serious enough to nearly kill him." Melas's voice remained level. Dangerously level. "That is sufficient legal ground for detention while we determine what that something is. And it gives the Mayor an answer she can present to the Tile Families and the press and everyone else demanding we restore order."

"An answer built on partial truth," Cornelius said.

"Better than no answer built on catastrophic error." Melas stood. His chair scraped against stone. "I am not arguing this with you again, Drake. The decision is made. The paperwork is being prepared. You have one hour before everything becomes official and permanent."

Cornelius's claws scraped against the bench. "One hour to do what?"

"Whatever you want. Go home. Conduct your research into magical headaches. Fly to the harbor and watch ships if that brings you comfort." Melas's weathered face was exhausted. "Just stay out of the official investigation. I have witnesses to re-interview, evidence to catalogue, and approximately six different political pressures to navigate. I cannot also manage a disgraced dragon who thinks theory is more important than procedure."

The words should have stung. Would have stung, an hour ago.

Now they just felt accurate.

"Captain." Zeph's voice was careful. "What happens after the hour?"

"The warrants are filed. Valerian remains in custody. The investigation continues along proper channels." Melas moved toward the corridor. "And you two go back to being librarian and intern instead of playing detective."

"We were not playing," Cornelius said.

Melas stopped. Turned. Something in his expression softened slightly. Not forgiveness. Not even approval. Just weariness.

"I know you were trying to help," he said. "I know your intentions were good. But intentions do not undo harm, Drake. Remember that before you insert yourself into another situation that requires more caution than cleverness."

He walked away. His footsteps faded down the corridor until only silence and lamplight remained.

Cornelius sat very still. His wings felt heavy. His spectacles needed adjustment but he could not summon the energy to fix them.

One hour. Sixty minutes before everything became permanent. Before Valerian was officially charged with crimes that served political necessity more than actual justice. Before the investigation sealed around a convenient answer that satisfied procedure while ignoring truth.

Before Cornelius's greatest failure was immortalized in legal documentation.

"We should go," he said. "To the Library. You need rest. I need to... process."

"Process what?" Zeph asked.

"My removal from future investigative consultation. My demonstrated incapacity for field work. The fundamental flaws in my methodology that nearly resulted in—" His throat closed. He could not finish the sentence.

"In you being wrong about something." Zeph's tone was matter-of-fact. "Yeah. That happened. You were catastrophically wrong. We established that already."

"Your point?"

"My point is sitting here feeling bad about it does not actually help anyone." Zeph shifted on the bench, turning to face Cornelius more directly. "You have one hour. Melas basically gave you permission to keep poking at this as long as you stay out of his way. So poke."

"To what end? I have already demonstrated that my deductions are—"

"Sometimes wrong. Yeah. Like I said, we established that." Zeph leaned forward, elbows on knees. "But you were not wrong about everything. The Judgment Salt. The method of administration. The fact that someone smart is running this whole thing. You got a lot of stuff right. You just got the wrong person."

"An error that nearly proved fatal."

"But did not. Because I warned him in time. Because Imelda is good at healing. Because we got lucky." Zeph's dark eyes were serious. "And yeah, luck is not methodology. I know you hate that. But maybe the problem was not your logic. Maybe it was just... incomplete data."

Cornelius wanted to argue. Wanted to explain that incomplete data was precisely the issue, that certainty required comprehensive evidence, that his failure represented fundamental flaws in—

"The Salt did not kill Valerian," Zeph said.

The non sequitur broke Cornelius's spiral of self-recrimination. He blinked. "What?"

"The Judgment Salt. It did not kill him. He survived." Zeph's hands moved as he talked, gesturing in the way he did when working through problems aloud. "Imelda said it only kills people who are genuinely guilty. Guilty of serious stuff. Real crimes or moral whatever."

"Yes. We established that Valerian carries guilt for something, even if not for Lucchesi's murder."

"Okay, but here is the weird part." Zeph's brow furrowed. "When I was watching him during the tribunal? He felt greasy."

"Greasy." Cornelius adjusted his spectacles with one claw. "Please clarify."

"Like... dishonest. Slippery. The way people feel when they are hiding something or lying about stuff." Zeph's nose wrinkled. "I thought it meant he was guilty. That he had done it and was just good at pretending."

"A reasonable interpretation given available evidence."

"Except he did not die." Zeph stood up, pacing the small alcove. "The Salt judged him guilty of something. Something serious enough to activate. But it did not kill him instantly like it killed Lucchesi."

Cornelius's analytical mind engaged despite himself. "The compound's lethality depends on the severity and specificity of guilt. Lucchesi died within seconds. Near-instantaneous system failure. Valerian survived long enough for healing intervention, suggesting his guilt triggered the Salt but at lower threshold."

"So what does that mean? Different crimes get different levels of poison?"

"No. The same compound, the same dosage." Cornelius's tail began its familiar thinking-swish. "But Judgment Salt responds to the subject's own moral state. Their genuine belief in their guilt regarding the specific accusation. Lucchesi died because he knew—at a fundamental level—that he was guilty of whatever the Salt was judging him for."

"And Valerian?"

"Valerian's reaction was slower. Less catastrophic. Which suggests..." Cornelius paused. The logic assembled itself with careful precision. "Which suggests that while he carries guilt for something, he did not believe himself guilty of the primary accusation. Of murdering Lucchesi."

"Because he did not do it."

"Because he did not do it," Cornelius confirmed. "The Salt judged him for secondary transgression. Something real, something serious enough to activate the compound. But not the murder."

Zeph stopped pacing. "What secondary transgression?"

Cornelius thought back to the interrogation. To Valerian's sneezing. To the careful way the Sphinx had navigated questions about his relationship with Lucchesi.

"Theft, perhaps," he said slowly. "Of a different nature than we initially theorized. Valerian stole time. Stole credit for work. Stole..."

"Stole what?"

"I do not know. But something significant enough that he felt genuine guilt about it when accused." Cornelius's claws tapped against stone. "The sneeze timing. He did not sneeze when denying murder. He sneezed when discussing his need for Lucchesi to remain alive. When explaining his motives."

"So he was lying about the motives?"

"Or simplifying them. Or omitting details." Cornelius's wings shifted slightly. "Sphinx biology punishes outright falsehood but also punishes misleading truth. Valerian wanted something from Lucchesi beyond simple recognition. Something he could not admit publicly."

"Okay, but how does that help us?" Zeph returned to the bench. Sat. "Valerian is guilty of something. We still do not know what. And we definitely do not know who actually killed Lucchesi."

Cornelius was quiet. The pieces were assembling. Not into certainty. Not into ninety percent probability. But into... possibility.

"The Salt killed Lucchesi instantly," he said.

"Yeah. We saw that."

"Which means Lucchesi was profoundly guilty. The accusation—whatever it was—struck at fundamental truth about his moral state." Cornelius straightened on the bench, his academic posture returning. "And the tribunal accusation I made against Valerian centered on intellectual theft. On stealing credit. On exploiting a collaborator's work."

"Right. Which Lucchesi actually did do. To Valerian."

"Precisely." The logic clicked into place with satisfying precision. "I accused Valerian of murdering Lucchesi for stealing his work. But what if the Judgment Salt was not judging Valerian's guilt regarding murder? What if it was judging Valerian's guilt regarding theft?"

Zeph blinked. "But Valerian did not steal anything. Lucchesi stole from him."

"Exactly." Cornelius's tail swished faster. "Valerian is the victim of theft. His guilt must derive from something else. Some other transgression unrelated to intellectual property. But Lucchesi..."

"Lucchesi died instantly when he drank the Salt. Because he was guilty." Zeph's eyes widened. "Holy shit. The Salt killed him because he was the thief."

"Not merely a thief. The thief. The primary guilty party in whatever crime the Salt was calibrated to judge." Cornelius felt his analytical framework rebuilding itself. "The compound was not randomly deployed. It was specifically prepared to judge intellectual theft. Academic fraud. The theft of ideas and credit and work."

"So someone poisoned Lucchesi with Salt specifically designed to kill intellectual thieves?"

"Which means the killer knew about Lucchesi's theft. Knew the specifics. Knew enough to calibrate the Salt's judgment parameters." Cornelius's wings spread slightly. "And knew that Lucchesi's guilt was profound enough to trigger immediate lethality."

"Okay, but wait." Zeph held up one hand. "If the Salt was judging intellectual theft, why did it also hurt Valerian? He is the victim, not the thief."

Cornelius paused. The question was valid. The logic required adjustment.

"Valerian is guilty of something," he said slowly. "The Salt proved that. But perhaps not guilty of the same category of crime. Perhaps the killer prepared the Salt with multiple judgment parameters. Or perhaps..."

He stopped. Memory surfaced—Valerian's face during interrogation. The way he had described his relationship with Lucchesi. The exploitation. The ghostwriting. The uncredited work.

"Conspiracy," Cornelius said.

"What?"

"Valerian participated in the fraud. Not as primary perpetrator, but as accomplice. He wrote the books. He provided the intellectual labor. He allowed Lucchesi to claim credit in exchange for salary and occasional acknowledgment." Cornelius's analytical mind turned the theory over, examining it from multiple angles. "He was victim and participant both. Exploited, yes. But complicit in the exploitation."

"That is messed up."

"That is complicated moral reality." Cornelius's tail curled. "The Salt judges guilt, not victimization. Valerian carries genuine guilt for his participation in academic fraud. Enough guilt to trigger the compound. But not enough to kill him instantly because his role was secondary. Coerced."

"So Lucchesi died because he was the primary thief. Valerian nearly died because he helped. And the killer..." Zeph trailed off. "The killer knew about all of it. About the theft. About Valerian's complicity. About everything."

"The killer knew enough to weaponize Lucchesi's guilt," Cornelius confirmed. "Which suggests intimate knowledge of his academic career. His methods. His crimes."

They sat in silence for a moment. The alcove felt smaller suddenly. More focused.

"Giovanni," Zeph said finally. "Lucchesi's old collaborator. He would know about the theft. He accused Lucchesi of stealing his work."

"Giovanni is a viable suspect." Cornelius's claws tapped stone in thinking-rhythm. "But so is anyone else who had access to Lucchesi's academic history. His published collaborators. His research assistants. His—"

"His publisher?" Zeph suggested. "The woman in gray with the ink stains? Valerian said she visited Lucchesi privately multiple times."

"Publishers would have intimate knowledge of authorship questions. Of ghostwriting arrangements. Of intellectual property disputes." Cornelius felt certainty building again. Not ninety percent. Not yet. But stronger than hypothesis. "They would know who actually wrote what. Who deserved credit. Who was being defrauded."

"So we are back to suspects with knowledge and motive."

"We are back to logic." Cornelius adjusted his spectacles. "Proper logic. Based on evidence rather than elegant narrative. The Salt killed Lucchesi for intellectual theft. The killer knew about that theft in sufficient detail to calibrate the judgment. Therefore the killer has access to information about Lucchesi's academic fraud."

"Which is still like six different people."

"Which is a manageable suspect pool requiring systematic investigation." Cornelius spread his wings, shook himself once. "We need to access the records. Publication history. Collaboration documentation. Correspondence between Lucchesi and anyone involved in his research."

"Captain Melas said we have one hour before everything becomes official."

"Then we should not waste time sitting in alcoves." Cornelius launched from the bench, gliding to Zeph's shoulder. His weight settled into the familiar perch position. "The records storage is three corridors east. We can access the municipal archives using my Library credentials."

"You really think we can solve this in one hour?"

"No." Cornelius's honesty surprised him. "But we can gather evidence. We can document patterns. We can prepare a proper case built on data rather than assumption. And when Melas finishes his political maneuvering, we can present findings that merit actual investigation."

"So we are doing this." Zeph stood. Started walking. "Even though you got kicked off the case. Even though I am just an intern. We are really doing this."

"We are conducting independent research that happens to intersect with an ongoing investigation," Cornelius corrected. "That is entirely different from interfering with official procedure."

"If you say so."

They navigated the corridor in comfortable silence. Zeph's footsteps provided rhythm. Cornelius's weight shifted with each step, maintaining balance through long practice.

"Cornelius?" Zeph said after a moment.

"Yes?"

"You listened to me. About the Salt not killing Valerian. You actually listened and changed your theory based on what I said."

"Your observation was logically sound and evidentially supported. Ignoring it would have been foolish."

"Yeah, but you would have ignored it six hours ago. Before the tribunal thing."

Cornelius had no response to that. Because Zeph was correct. Six hours ago, Cornelius would have dismissed the observation as insufficient to override his elegant solution. Would have constructed rationalization for why the data fit his existing theory rather than revising the theory to match the data.

"Perhaps I am learning," he said finally.

"Good. Because two liabilities learning together is better than one liability being stubborn alone."

"That is not how the expression— " Cornelius stopped. Recognized the teasing tone. "You are deliberately misquoting our agreement."

"Maybe. But it is still true." Zeph turned a corner. The records storage entrance appeared ahead—solid door marked with official City Hall insignia. "So. We break in, find proof of who knew about Lucchesi's theft, and solve the murder before Melas files his fake charges. Easy."

"We do not break in. We utilize appropriate access protocols." But Cornelius felt something unfamiliar stirring in his chest. Not quite hope. Not yet.

But possibility. The glimmer of logic reassembling itself into useful structure. The familiar comfort of pattern-recognition turned toward truth rather than narrative elegance.

They had one hour.

It would have to be enough.

# Chapter 14

# Chapter 14

The records storage door was locked.

Cornelius had expected as much. City Hall maintained security protocols even during emergencies—perhaps especially during emergencies. He adjusted his spectacles and examined the mechanism with professional interest.

"Can you pick it?" Zeph asked.

"I am a Library Dragon, not a common thief." Cornelius extended one talon toward the bronze plate surrounding the lock. "However, I do possess institutional access credentials that should—"

The door opened from the inside.

Imelda stood in the threshold, her copper-beaded hair catching lamplight. She wore the same formal robes from the gala, now rumpled and ink-stained at the cuffs. Her expression suggested she had been expecting them.

"I wondered when you would arrive," she said.

Cornelius blinked. "You are already here."

"I came to review the publication archives after Captain Melas released me from witness interviews. The official investigation has stalled into procedural documentation. I concluded my time would be better spent conducting actual research." She stepped aside, gesturing them into the antechamber. "I assume you reached similar conclusions."

The space beyond was smaller than Cornelius had anticipated. Not the grand archive room he had envisioned, but a narrow chamber lined with filing cabinets and document boxes. A single work table occupied the center, its surface already covered with open ledgers and loose papers.

Cornelius glided from Zeph's shoulder to the table. His talons clicked against wood worn smooth by decades of bureaucratic labor.

"We have less than one hour before Captain Melas files formal charges against Valerian," he said. "I need access to Lucchesi's publication history. Complete collaboration records. Any documentation of ghostwriting arrangements or disputed authorship."

Imelda moved to one of the filing cabinets, her fingers trailing across labeled drawers. "You have revised your theory."

It was not a question. Cornelius's tail curled.

"My previous theory was catastrophically flawed. I am constructing a new framework based on evidence rather than elegant narrative." He paused. "Zeph observed that the Judgment Salt did not kill Valerian. The lethality difference suggests the compound was judging different levels of guilt for the same category of crime."

"Intellectual theft," Imelda said. She pulled open a drawer marked *Literary Registry—L through M*. "You believe Lucchesi died because he was the primary thief. Valerian survived because his guilt was secondary. Complicit but coerced."

"Yes." Cornelius felt vindication warm his chest. "Which means the killer knew about the theft. Knew the specifics in sufficient detail to calibrate the Salt's judgment parameters. I need to establish who had access to that knowledge."

Imelda withdrew a thick folder and carried it to the table. "Then you need more than publication records. You need stylistic analysis."

"I need what?"

"Literary forensics." She opened the folder, revealing contracts and correspondence in neat chronological arrangement. "The Registry tracks authorship disputes. Copyright challenges. Ghostwriting arrangements when they are disclosed. But the most reliable method for identifying true authorship is not legal documentation. It is prose style."

Cornelius's analytical mind engaged with the concept. "You are suggesting textual analysis as evidence."

"I am suggesting that every writer has a voice. A fingerprint in their sentence structure, their word choice, their emotional register." Imelda pulled one document free—a contract dated five years prior. "Lucchesi's early work is here. His doctoral thesis on Aetheric Resonance Theory. His first three monographs. All written before he became famous."

She arranged them across the table with practiced precision. Then she withdrew a second stack—newer publications bearing Lucchesi's name but marked with small notation symbols in the Registry's hand.

"And these are his later works," she said. "The bestsellers. The books that made him a household name."

Zeph leaned over the table, careful not to disturb the arrangement. "What do the symbols mean?"

"Disputed provenance." Imelda tapped one notation. "Nothing actionable. No formal challenges. But the Registry clerks are trained to notice inconsistency. These books were flagged for stylistic deviation."

"Meaning someone suspected Lucchesi did not actually write them," Cornelius said.

"Meaning someone with trained literary judgment recognized that these books were written by a different hand." Imelda opened the first early monograph. "Look. This is Lucchesi's genuine voice."

Cornelius read the opening paragraph. The prose was dense. Technical. Every sentence constructed with mathematical precision, each clause building on the previous with rigid logical progression. The emotional register was nonexistent—pure academic discourse stripped of personality.

"He writes like a particularly tedious equation," Cornelius observed.

"He writes like a man who values theory over humanity." Imelda closed that volume and opened one of the later bestsellers. "Now look at this."

The difference was immediate. The opening paragraph still discussed Aetheric theory, still maintained scholarly rigor. But the sentences had rhythm. Flow. The technical concepts were anchored to human experience—comparing resonance patterns to heartbeats, describing magical theory through the lens of personal discovery.

It was warm. Accessible. Alive.

"They do not match," Cornelius said.

"They could not possibly match." Imelda's voice held quiet certainty. "These are fundamentally different writers. Different minds. Different souls expressing themselves through language."

Zeph's hand hovered over the bestseller. "So Lucchesi did not write this."

"Lucchesi provided the outline. The theoretical framework. The citations to obscure sources." Imelda turned pages, her copper beads clicking softly. "But someone else transformed that framework into actual prose. Someone who understood how to make theory sing."

"Valerian," Cornelius said.

The pieces assembled themselves with crystalline clarity. Not the forced elegance of his previous theory. Not the narrative satisfaction of certainty. Just logic following evidence to inevitable conclusion.

"Valerian ghostwrote the bestsellers," he continued. "Lucchesi gave him notes and outlines. Valerian produced the manuscripts. And Lucchesi claimed credit for work that was fundamentally, spiritually Valerian's creation."

"Soul theft," Imelda said quietly. "Not merely stealing credit. Stealing voice. Stealing the part of Valerian that lived in those words."

Cornelius's claws scraped against wood. The magnitude of the crime clarified itself. Academic fraud was common enough. Unethical but mundane. But this was different. Lucchesi had not simply plagiarized research. He had taken Valerian's soul—the essence of how Valerian understood and expressed truth—and worn it like stolen clothing.

"The Judgment Salt was calibrated to judge that theft," he said. "Not generic fraud. Specific theft of identity. Of voice. Of the fundamental expression of self."

"Which is why Lucchesi died instantly." Imelda's fingers traced the contract dates. "He knew. At the deepest level, he knew exactly what he had stolen. The guilt was absolute."

"And Valerian survived because his guilt was different." Zeph's voice was soft. "He felt guilty for participating. For letting it happen. For not fighting harder to claim his own work."

"Precisely." Cornelius's tail swished. The theory held weight now. Substance. "The killer knew about the soul theft. Knew enough to weaponize Lucchesi's own guilt. Which means the killer had access to both men's work. The real work and the stolen work."

"The publisher," Zeph said. "The woman in gray with ink stains. Valerian said she visited Lucchesi privately. She would know who actually wrote what."

Cornelius considered this. "Publishers process manuscripts. They would recognize stylistic inconsistency. Would notice if an author's voice changed dramatically between books."

"And they would have documentation." Imelda gestured to the Registry folder. "Correspondence. Editorial notes. Original manuscripts showing revision history."

The logic was sound. Compelling. But something nagged at Cornelius's analytical framework. He could not identify the flaw, which meant—

"But," he said carefully, testing the theory for weakness, "a publisher's primary concern is commercial success. If Lucchesi's books sold well, why would they care about authorship disputes?"

"Money," Zeph offered. "Maybe Lucchesi owed them something. Or they wanted a bigger cut."

"Possible." Cornelius's wings shifted. "Though that suggests greed rather than moral judgment. The Judgment Salt implies the killer believed they were enacting justice. Punishing genuine wrong."

Imelda was quiet. Her gaze moved across the documents with the focused intensity Cornelius recognized from her deepest research states. She was thinking. Processing. Following some thread he could not yet see.

"The Salt required specific knowledge," she said finally. "Not merely knowing that Lucchesi stole Valerian's work. Knowing the exact nature of the crime. The soul theft aspect. The violation of identity and voice."

"Yes."

"That level of understanding suggests intimate familiarity with both men. With their relationship. With the emotional dimension of the theft." Her copper beads clinked as she turned to face them fully. "A publisher would know the commercial fraud. But would they understand the spiritual violation?"

Cornelius's analytical mind caught the distinction. "You are suggesting the killer had personal connection to one or both victims."

"I am suggesting the killer cared. Not about money or credit or even justice in the abstract." Imelda's dark eyes were steady. "They cared about the specific harm done to Valerian. About what was stolen from him. About restoring some form of moral balance."

"So someone who knew Valerian well," Zeph said. "Family? Friend?"

"Valerian is Sphinx-kin." Cornelius recalled the interrogation. "He mentioned no family in Solterra Bay. His relationship with Lucchesi was secret. His professional circle would have been limited to—"

He stopped.

Zeph was rubbing his temple. The gesture was subtle but Cornelius had learned to recognize its significance. The headache returning. The electric sensation that preceded danger or revelation.

"Zeph?" he said carefully.

"I am thinking." Zeph's hand pressed harder against his skull. "About the tribunal. When Valerian drank the water. Right before I knew it was poisoned."

"You experienced precognitive warning."

"Yeah, but it was weird. Different from the other times." Zeph's eyes were unfocused, gaze turned inward. "Usually the headaches feel like pressure. Like something building up behind my eyes. But this one was..."

"Was what?"

"Musical." Zeph's face scrunched with the effort of articulation. "Like someone screaming but the scream had melody. Like the pain had rhythm. Does that make any sense?"

Cornelius's tail went still. "Musical pain."

"I know it sounds insane—"

"No." Cornelius turned to Imelda. "What species produces magical effects through sound? Through melody and rhythm?"

Imelda's expression shifted. Understanding blooming across her weathered features.

"Sirens," she said.

The pieces locked into place. Not with satisfying click of his previous theories. This was slower. More deliberate. Each element confirming the next with patient accumulation of evidence.

"Sirens manipulate perception through song," Cornelius said. The words came faster as logic assembled itself. "Their magic operates through auditory channels. Creates emotional resonance. Influences—"

"Influences guilt," Imelda finished. "A Siren could not create guilt where none existed. But they could amplify existing guilt. Could tune someone's own conscience to specific frequency. Could make that guilt resonate until it became... active."

"The Judgment Salt requires the subject to acknowledge their guilt," Cornelius said. "To believe, fundamentally, that they deserve punishment. A Siren could ensure that belief. Could make certain the guilty party was psychologically prepared for judgment."

Zeph lowered his hand from his temple. "So someone sang at Lucchesi? Made him feel extra guilty so the Salt would work?"

"Not sang. Not audibly." Imelda moved to a different filing cabinet, her movements precise. "Siren magic does not require performative song. The melody operates on frequencies most species cannot consciously perceive. A human would experience it as emotional pressure. A Lamassu-touched youth with developing guardian senses might perceive it as rhythmic pain."

She pulled open a drawer marked *Gala Registry—Witnesses and Attendees*. Her fingers walked through alphabetical dividers with practiced speed.

"We need the attendance roster," she said. "Anyone with Siren heritage would be documented. Registry protocols require species disclosure for—"

"Karellas," Zeph said. "Chloe Karellas. She is a Siren."

Cornelius's wings spread slightly. "You are certain?"

"I sat near her family during the speech. Her mother was wearing those ear cuffs that Sirens use to dampen their own magic in crowds. And Chloe had the webbing. Between her fingers. You can see it when she gestures."

Imelda found the entry. Read it aloud. "Chloe Karellas. Age nineteen. Siren. Student at the Maritime Academy. Daughter of Pavlos and Irene Karellas of House Karellas."

Silence settled over the antechamber. The kind of silence that preceded revelation. The moment when theory crystallized into actionable certainty.

"Why would Chloe Karellas care about Valerian's stolen work?" Zeph asked. "They are not related. Not friends that we know of."

Cornelius considered the question. The logic required additional links. Additional evidence. He was determined not to construct premature narrative this time.

"We need more information," he said. "Chloe's connection to either victim. Her access to Judgment Salt. Her knowledge of—"

"Her relationship with Valerian," Imelda said quietly.

Both Cornelius and Zeph turned to stare at her.

Imelda's expression was distant. Remembering. "Valerian mentioned during interrogation that he had been collecting evidence. Preparing documentation to prove his authorship. He said he needed allies. People who understood literary analysis and could verify the stylistic discrepancy."

"So?" Zeph asked.

"So the Maritime Academy has an excellent literature program. Many students undertake independent study with published authors." Imelda closed the roster. "And Sphinx-kin have natural affinity for truth-seeking professions. Teaching. Mentorship. Particularly with students who show genuine intellectual curiosity."

Cornelius's analytical mind raced ahead. "You are suggesting Valerian mentored Chloe. That they formed academic relationship. That she learned about the theft through—"

"Through helping him document it," Imelda finished. "Through comparing manuscripts. Through witnessing firsthand the evidence of what Lucchesi had stolen. Through understanding exactly what soul theft means to someone like Valerian."

The theory held weight. Substance. But it still required confirmation. Cornelius needed certainty above ninety percent before—

No. He stopped that thought. Adjusted it.

He needed reasonable certainty. Sufficient certainty to act. Not perfect certainty. Not elegant narrative closure. Just enough evidence to justify presenting the theory to Captain Melas and letting proper investigation determine truth.

"We have motive," he said slowly. "Chloe witnessed the soul theft. Understood its magnitude. Developed connection to Valerian through academic mentorship. When Sirens form bonds, those bonds are—"

"Absolute," Imelda said. "Sirens are fiercely protective of chosen family. It is fundamental to their nature. If Chloe accepted Valerian as mentor, as someone under her protection, then his harm would be her harm."

"So she killed Lucchesi to protect Valerian." Zeph's voice was flat. "That is the theory."

"She executed Lucchesi for soul theft using a method that required his own guilt as weapon," Cornelius corrected. "The distinction matters. This was not simple murder. It was judgment."

"Okay, but how did she get the Salt? How did she administer it? How did she know about Judgment Salt at all?" Zeph was pacing now, his footsteps echoing against stone. "And why poison Valerian at the tribunal if she was trying to protect him?"

The questions were valid. Critical. Cornelius's theory had gaps. Large ones.

"We need more evidence," he admitted. "Documentation of Chloe and Valerian's relationship. Proof she had access to alchemical knowledge. Explanation for how she administered the poison and—"

"And we need time we do not have." Zeph stopped pacing. Checked the corridor beyond the antechamber. "How long until Melas files the warrants?"

Imelda consulted a small timepiece from her robes. "Thirty-seven minutes."

Cornelius felt pressure building in his chest. The familiar anxiety of insufficient data colliding with temporal constraint. He needed more time. More evidence. More certainty.

But certainty was luxury. Right now, he had reasonable suspicion and limited window for action.

"We present what we have," he said. The decision felt wrong. Premature. But necessary. "We take the theory to Captain Melas. Explain the logic. Let him investigate properly before filing charges against the wrong suspect."

"He kicked you off the investigation," Zeph pointed out.

"He removed me from official involvement. He said nothing about providing relevant information that emerges from independent research." Cornelius adjusted his spectacles. "Besides, he gave us one hour. We are using that hour to bring him actionable intelligence."

"Intelligence that could be completely wrong," Zeph said. "Like the Valerian theory was wrong."

The words stung. But they were fair.

Cornelius looked at the documents spread across the table. At Imelda's careful analysis. At the evidence of soul theft preserved in prose style and Registry notation. At the logical chain connecting Chloe to motive, means, and magical capability.

It was not ninety percent certain. Perhaps not even eighty percent.

But it was considerably more than hypothesis. It was reasoned analysis supported by evidence and expert testimony.

"We might be wrong," he admitted. "But we are significantly less wrong than when we accused Valerian. And if we are right, Captain Melas is about to file formal charges against an innocent man while the actual killer walks free."

Imelda began gathering the documents. Her movements were efficient, practiced. "I will accompany you. If Melas requires expert testimony regarding stylistic analysis, I can provide it."

"And I can explain the musical headache thing," Zeph added. "Even though it sounds completely insane."

"It sounds like emerging guardian sense interpreting Siren magic," Imelda corrected gently. "Which is precisely the kind of sensory data that matters in cases involving species-specific abilities."

Cornelius spread his wings. Shook himself once. The gesture helped settle his nerves into working order.

"Then we proceed," he said. "Two liabilities and one expert witness. It will have to be sufficient."

Zeph grinned despite the tension. "Pretty sure Imelda does not count as a liability."

"I have been working with Cornelius for forty-three years," Imelda said, a hint of warmth entering her voice. "I am absolutely a liability. Just a different category."

She tucked the documents into a leather satchel and moved toward the corridor. Cornelius glided to Zeph's shoulder, settling into the familiar perch. His weight distributed properly. His talons gripped without piercing fabric.

They had thirty-seven minutes to convince Captain Melas that his political solution was wrong. That the real killer was not Valerian but a nineteen-year-old Siren student acting as executioner on behalf of a stolen soul.

Thirty-seven minutes to prevent one injustice and potentially expose another.

It would have to be enough.

# Chapter 15

# Chapter 15

Cornelius's analytical framework felt solid. Not the forced elegance of his Valerian theory. Not the premature certainty that had nearly killed an innocent man. This was different. This was evidence-based deduction supported by expert testimony and observable phenomenon.

Chloe Karellas had learned about the soul theft through academic mentorship with Valerian. She had witnessed the violation of his identity. She had used Siren magic to amplify Lucchesi's guilt until the Judgment Salt became lethal. She had acted as executioner to restore moral balance.

The logic held. The pieces fit. Cornelius was approximately seventy-three percent certain. Which was considerably less than ninety percent. Which was precisely the point. He had learned caution. Had adjusted his threshold. Had—

"Wait."

Zeph's voice cut through Cornelius's mental organization. The young man had stopped in the antechamber doorway, one hand pressed against the stone frame. His dark eyes were distant. Unfocused.

"Wait," he said again.

Cornelius's tail stilled mid-swish. "What is it?"

"The headache. At the tribunal." Zeph's hand moved to his temple in the familiar gesture of remembered pain. "When did it spike?"

"During the tribunal itself," Cornelius said. His claws tapped against Zeph's shoulder in impatient rhythm. "When Chloe was presumably using Siren magic to—"

"No. I mean exactly when." Zeph's brow furrowed. The concentration was visible. Physical. "You were accusing Valerian. Everyone was watching him. And I felt the musical thing building. Getting louder. More rhythmic."

"Yes. The Siren influence amplifying guilt."

"But it peaked when Valerian reached for the water." Zeph's eyes focused suddenly. Sharp. Present. "Not when you were accusing him. Not during the emotional pressure. When his hand touched the glass. That is when my head felt like it was going to explode."

Cornelius's analytical processes stuttered. "The timing is consistent with Siren magic activating the Salt. Making Valerian's existing guilt resonate with—"

"Cornelius." Zeph turned to face him fully. "If Chloe was trying to protect Valerian, why did the danger spike when he drank?"

The question hung in the antechamber. Simple. Direct. Devastating.

Imelda had gone very still. Her copper beads were silent. Her dark eyes moved between Cornelius and Zeph with the focused intensity of someone following a logical chain toward unwelcome conclusion.

"Your headaches signal danger," she said quietly. "Malicious intent. Threat."

"Right." Zeph's hand was still pressed against his temple. "And the biggest spike—the one that made me scream—happened when Valerian drank. Not when Lucchesi died. When Valerian was being targeted."

Cornelius felt his certainty fracture. Not collapse. Not yet. But develop stress cracks. Fissures that would require immediate repair or complete reconstruction.

"Perhaps the Siren magic was directed at both men," he said. The theory felt weak even as he articulated it. "Amplifying guilt in anyone present who carried transgression related to—"

"Soul theft," Zeph finished. "Yeah. Except Valerian did not steal anything. Lucchesi stole from him. So why would Chloe target the victim?"

Imelda moved to the work table. Her hands rested on the documents they had assembled. The evidence of ghostwriting. Of stolen voice. Of the crime that had presumably motivated everything.

"She would not," Imelda said. "If Chloe understood the theft. If she knew Valerian was the victim and Lucchesi the perpetrator. If she was acting to avenge or protect Valerian. She would not target him."

"Unless she did not know," Cornelius said slowly.

The pieces were shifting. The elegant structure he had built was deconstructing itself. Not because the evidence was wrong. But because the interpretation required adjustment. Fundamental revision.

"Did not know what?" Zeph asked.

"Did not know about the ghostwriting." Cornelius's wings spread slightly. The physical gesture helped organize his thoughts. "Did not know Valerian was the true author. Did not know about the soul theft at all."

"But you said she was his student. That she helped him compile evidence."

"I theorized that relationship based on circumstantial evidence. Valerian mentioned needing allies familiar with literary analysis. Chloe attends the Maritime Academy which has literature programs. The connection seemed probable." Cornelius adjusted his spectacles with one claw. "But I have no documentation of actual mentorship. No proof they even knew each other."

"So maybe they did not." Zeph's voice was flat. "Maybe the whole academic relationship thing is wrong."

Cornelius's tail curled tight against his body. "If Chloe did not know Valerian, did not know about the theft, then her motive cannot be avenging his stolen work."

"Then what was her motive?" Zeph asked.

The question required complete analytical restructuring. Cornelius forced himself to examine the evidence without the framework of his previous theory. Raw data. Observable facts. Documented phenomenon.

Chloe Karellas. Nineteen years old. Siren. Daughter of Pavlos and Irene. Student at the Maritime Academy.

Lucchesi. Famous author. Dead from Judgment Salt calibrated to judge intellectual theft.

Valerian. Ghostwriter. Lover. Nearly dead from the same compound during a public tribunal.

Lover.

The word crystallized in Cornelius's mind. Not as tangential detail. As central fact.

"They were lovers," he said aloud.

Both Zeph and Imelda looked at him.

"Valerian and Lucchesi. Three years ago for eight months. Valerian told us during interrogation." Cornelius's claws scraped against Zeph's jacket. "Lucchesi ended the relationship for someone more socially advantageous. But they continued working together professionally."

"Okay," Zeph said. "We knew that. How does that change—"

"The Karellas family." Cornelius's mind raced through implications. Through the social structure of Solterra Bay. Through the political marriages and strategic alliances that governed Tile Family interactions. "Pavlos Karellas is involved in smuggling. Document concealment. Activities that require powerful connections and political protection."

"So?"

"So Tile Families create alliances through marriage. Through social bonds. Through relationships that serve mutual interest." Cornelius felt the theory assembling itself. Not elegant. Not satisfying. But increasingly probable. "What if one of those relationships involved Lucchesi?"

Imelda's expression shifted. "You think Lucchesi was connected to the Karellas family."

"I think Lucchesi was connected to someone in the Karellas family in a way that would matter to Chloe. In a way that would motivate a protective, family-oriented Siren to act." Cornelius's wings trembled slightly. "What if Lucchesi was involved with Irene?"

Silence.

Then Zeph said, "Holy shit."

"Language," Cornelius murmured automatically. But the rebuke was hollow. His entire analytical framework was reorganizing around the new possibility. "Chloe loves her family. Sirens are fiercely protective of chosen bonds. If she believed someone was destroying her parents' marriage. Threatening her mother. Damaging the family structure..."

"She would kill them," Imelda finished quietly. "Not for justice in the abstract. For protection. For preserving what she loved."

"But the Judgment Salt." Zeph's hands moved in agitated gestures. "It killed Lucchesi for intellectual theft. The soul theft thing. If Chloe was targeting him for adultery, why did the Salt judge him for plagiarism?"

The question was valid. Critical. Cornelius forced himself to think through the mechanics. The alchemical properties. The way Judgment Salt responded to moral certainty.

"The Salt requires the subject to believe they are guilty," he said slowly. "To acknowledge—at fundamental level—that they deserve punishment. But it does not require the punishment to match the specific crime being judged by the poisoner."

"I do not understand," Zeph said.

"Lucchesi carried profound guilt about stealing Valerian's work. About the soul theft. That guilt was absolute. Fundamental." Cornelius's tail swished in thinking-rhythm. "When Chloe used Siren magic to amplify his guilt—intending to make him acknowledge his sin regarding adultery—the Salt responded to the guilt that was strongest. Most deeply embedded in his conscience."

"So she was trying to judge him for sleeping with her mom, but the Salt judged him for stealing Valerian's writing instead?"

"The Salt judges whatever guilt resonates most powerfully with the subject's moral self-concept." Imelda's voice held grim certainty. "Lucchesi perhaps rationalized the affair. Justified it. Convinced himself it was acceptable. But he could not rationalize the theft. Could not escape knowing—absolutely—that he had stolen something irreplaceable from Valerian."

"Which means Chloe targeted the right man for the wrong reason," Cornelius said. "She intended to execute an adulterer. The Salt executed a thief. Both crimes were real. Both carried genuine guilt. The mechanism simply responded to whichever transgression Lucchesi could not deny to himself."

Zeph was very still. "And Valerian?"

The question hung heavy. Cornelius's chest tightened with approaching revelation. With the horror of implication following logic to inevitable conclusion.

"Valerian was Lucchesi's lover three years ago," he said quietly. "After Lucchesi ended that relationship, he pursued someone new. Someone more socially advantageous. Someone who could provide political connections and family status."

"Irene," Imelda said.

"Irene Karellas. Wife of a powerful shipping magnate. Mother to a protective Siren daughter." Cornelius felt his wings fold tight against his body. "If Chloe discovered the affair between her mother and Lucchesi, she would want to eliminate the threat. But she would need to be certain. Would need to identify everyone involved in destroying her family."

"So she killed Lucchesi first," Zeph said. His voice had gone hollow. "At the gala. In front of everyone. Using the Salt to judge him."

"But the Salt proved only that Lucchesi was guilty," Cornelius continued. The logic was relentless now. Inescapable. "It did not prove he was the only guilty party. If there was more than one lover. If someone else had also been involved with Irene. If Chloe wanted to be absolutely certain she eliminated every threat to her family..."

"She would target them too." Zeph's hand pressed harder against his temple. "The tribunal. Valerian drinking the water. That was the second attempt. She was going after him because she thought—"

"Because she knew," Cornelius corrected grimly. "Or suspected strongly. Valerian and Lucchesi had a romantic history. Perhaps Chloe learned about it through investigation. Through observing them together. Through the way Valerian reacted to Lucchesi's death."

"Or maybe she just asked her mother who else she was sleeping with," Zeph said flatly.

The bluntness was jarring. But accurate. If Irene had confessed the affair—willingly or under pressure from a Siren daughter whose magic could compel emotional honesty—she might have named Valerian. Might have identified him as former lover or continued connection. Might have inadvertently marked him as target.

"The Judgment Salt at the tribunal was not targeting Valerian for theft," Cornelius said. Each word felt heavy. Significant. "It was targeting him for adultery. For his relationship with Irene. For being part of the network of lovers threatening Chloe's family structure."

"But it did not kill him." Imelda's hands were very still on the documents. "Unlike Lucchesi, Valerian survived."

"Because Valerian does not carry profound guilt about the affair," Cornelius said. "He and Lucchesi ended their relationship years ago. If he became involved with Irene afterward, he might have rationalized it as separate. Discrete. Not connected to his previous relationship. Not morally equivalent to Lucchesi's theft of his work."

"Or maybe he just did not sleep with her," Zeph said. "Maybe Chloe got it wrong. Thought Valerian was the other lover when he was not."

Cornelius considered this. "Possible. But the Salt did activate. Valerian collapsed. He experienced sufficient guilt about something to trigger the compound's judgment mechanism."

"Yeah, but not enough to kill him. Not like Lucchesi." Zeph's dark eyes were intense. "So either Valerian is guilty of a lesser version of the crime Chloe was judging, or he is guilty of something else entirely."

"The ghostwriting," Imelda said quietly. "Valerian carries genuine guilt about participating in the fraud. About allowing Lucchesi to steal his voice. That guilt would register with the Salt even if the specific accusation was different."

"Either way, Chloe tried to kill him." Zeph's voice was strained. "She poisoned his water during the tribunal. Used Siren magic to amplify whatever guilt he carried. Tried to execute him the same way she executed Lucchesi."

"But failed," Cornelius said. "Valerian survived. Is currently in City Hall's infirmary under guard. Unconscious but recovering."

The implications assembled themselves with terrible clarity.

"She will try again," Cornelius said.

Silence.

Then Imelda said, "Yes."

"She thinks Valerian is a threat to her family. An adulterer destroying her mother's marriage. A corrupting influence that must be eliminated." Cornelius's claws gripped tighter against Zeph's shoulder. "And she has already demonstrated willingness to use Judgment Salt as weapon. To act as executioner. To kill in protection of those she loves."

"But Valerian is in the infirmary," Zeph said. "Under guard. Captain Melas has him detained pending formal charges. Chloe cannot just walk in and poison him again."

"Can she not?" Cornelius's tail lashed once. "She poisoned him during a public tribunal in front of dozens of witnesses including the Captain of the Watch. She administered the compound to a glass that was supposedly secure. That was being watched."

"How did she even do that?" Zeph asked. "The water was already on the platform before the tribunal started. We saw the guards check everything."

Cornelius considered the mechanics. The logistics. The method of administration.

"Siren magic operates through influence," he said slowly. "Through suggestion. Through making people want to do things they might not otherwise consider. If Chloe needed access to the water glasses, she could have influenced a servant. A guard. Anyone with legitimate reason to approach the platform."

"So she could do it again," Zeph said. "To Valerian. In the infirmary."

"If she has access. If she has opportunity. If she believes he still poses threat to her family." Cornelius felt pressure building in his chest. The familiar anxiety of insufficient time colliding with necessary action. "We need to inform Captain Melas immediately."

"And tell him what exactly?" Zeph's voice held frustration. "That we were wrong about our first theory that Chloe was avenging Valerian? That now we think she is actually trying to kill him because we have a different theory about her mom having an affair?"

The summary was brutally accurate.

"We have evidence," Cornelius said. But even as he spoke, he recognized the weakness. "Circumstantial evidence. Logical inference. Zeph's danger sense indicating Valerian was the target. The timing of—"

"Your danger sense that Melas does not know about because we have not told him yet," Zeph interrupted. "Your weird magical headaches that sound completely insane if we try to explain them right now."

"Imelda can testify to the validity of guardian senses," Cornelius said.

"And I will." Imelda's voice was calm. Measured. "But Captain Melas is currently preparing warrants against Valerian for attempted suicide and conspiracy. He is operating under political pressure to produce answers. To restore order. To satisfy the Mayor and the Tile Families."

"Which means he is unlikely to believe that Valerian is actually the intended victim rather than the perpetrator," Cornelius finished. His wings drooped slightly. "He will interpret our new theory as desperate attempt to avoid admitting our investigation has been consistently wrong."

"Because it has been," Zeph said. Not unkindly. Just stating fact. "We were wrong about Valerian killing Lucchesi. We were wrong about Chloe avenging Valerian's stolen work. We keep constructing these elaborate theories that sound really good until they completely fall apart."

The words stung. But they were accurate. Cornelius had been catastrophically wrong twice. Had nearly caused deaths through premature certainty. Had lost Captain Melas's trust and his own confidence in his methods.

"However," Zeph continued, "we were right about the Judgment Salt. Right about the Siren magic. Right about Chloe being involved somehow."

"We have no proof of her involvement," Cornelius said. "No documentation. No witnesses. Nothing that would stand as evidence in formal investigation."

"We have logic." Zeph's hand dropped from his temple. His dark eyes met Cornelius's golden gaze. "We have the fact that someone used Siren magic at the tribunal and Chloe is the only Siren we know was present. We have the fact that the danger I felt was directed at Valerian, not at proving general guilt. We have..."

He trailed off. His expression shifted. The distant look that meant he was following some internal thread toward revelation.

"What?" Cornelius asked.

"The walnut cages," Zeph said quietly.

"I beg your pardon?"

"At the tribunal. When everyone was seated. I was looking around because I was nervous and did not want to make eye contact with Sophia." Zeph's hands moved in remembered gesture. "Chloe was sitting with her parents. Her mother had those ear cuffs. The silver ones with the pearl settings."

"Sirens use ear cuffs to dampen their magic in crowds," Imelda said. "To prevent accidental influence. Standard courtesy."

"Right. But Chloe was not wearing any." Zeph's voice gained certainty. "Her ears were bare. I remember because she had these really delicate earrings. Little silver chains with blue stones. And I thought it was weird because her mom had the big chunky cuffs and Chloe just had the decorative stuff."

Cornelius's analytical mind seized on the detail. "If Chloe attended a crowded formal event without magical dampeners, she was either ignorant of courtesy—"

"Which she is not," Imelda said. "Sirens are trained from childhood in proper magical etiquette. Especially Sirens from prominent families. The social consequences of accidental influence are severe."

"Then she deliberately chose not to dampen her abilities." Cornelius felt the theory solidifying. "Because she intended to use them. To influence someone. To ensure that when the moment came, her magic would be available and active."

"That is not proof," Zeph said. "That is just one more piece of circumstantial whatever."

"But it patterns with everything else." Cornelius's tail resumed its thinking-swish. "Chloe had motive if she believed Valerian threatened her family. She had method through Siren magic. She had opportunity at both the gala speech and the tribunal."

"But we still do not know how she got the Judgment Salt. How she learned about its properties. How she administered it." Zeph's frustration was visible. "We have a theory that explains some stuff but we cannot prove any of it."

Cornelius was silent. Because Zeph was correct. They had logical framework. They had reasonable hypothesis. They had approximately sixty-eight percent certainty, which was considerably better than random speculation but significantly worse than actionable evidence.

And they had approximately thirty-one minutes before Captain Melas filed warrants that would cement Valerian's status as guilty party while the actual killer walked free.

While the actual killer potentially planned her next attempt.

"We need to find Chloe," Cornelius said. "Before she reaches Valerian. Before she completes what she started at the tribunal."

"How?" Zeph asked. "We do not know where she is. City Hall is huge. There are hundreds of people still trapped in the lockdown. And even if we find her, what do we do? Accuse her based on your logic and my headaches?"

Cornelius had no answer. The familiar weight of insufficient data pressed against his chest. The recognition that proper investigation required time they did not have. Resources they did not possess. Authority they had explicitly lost.

"We warn the guards," Imelda said quietly. "At the infirmary. We inform them that Valerian may be at risk. That additional security precautions are warranted. We do not need to explain our full theory. We simply need to ensure he is protected while we gather actual evidence."

"And then?" Cornelius asked.

"Then we find Chloe Karellas and we ask her directly." Imelda's dark eyes were steady. "Before she kills again."

# Chapter 16

# Chapter 16

The infirmary occupied a converted council chamber on City Hall's second floor. Cornelius had passed it dozens of times during previous visits to the municipal archives. He had never paid particular attention to the space. Council chambers were fundamentally uninteresting—designed for procedural meetings and administrative tedium.

Now the chamber functioned as emergency medical facility. The wooden doors stood closed. Two guards flanked the entrance in standard protective formation. Their posture suggested exhaustion tempered by professional discipline. Long night. Longer still before the lockdown ended.

Cornelius perched on Zeph's shoulder approximately thirty feet down the corridor. The position offered adequate visual access while maintaining reasonable distance. Not ideal for detailed observation. But sufficient for their immediate purpose.

Which was preventing Chloe Karellas from murdering Valerian.

Captain Melas stood between them and the infirmary entrance. His back was to Cornelius and Zeph. His attention focused on the guards and the closed doors beyond. He had listened to their theory with visible skepticism. Had questioned the logic. Had demanded evidence they could not provide.

But he had also accompanied them to the infirmary. Had positioned himself as barrier between potential threat and unconscious victim. Had ordered the guards to deny entry to anyone except authorized medical personnel.

Cornelius appreciated procedural caution. It was sensible. Defensible. Entirely inadequate.

"She will not simply announce herself," he said quietly. His voice carried just far enough for Zeph and the Captain to hear. "She will use pretense. False credentials. Siren influence if necessary."

Captain Melas did not turn around. "So you have said. Multiple times."

"I am ensuring clarity of expectations."

"You are repeating yourself." The Captain's shoulders rose and fell in slow breath. "I understand your theory. Young Siren believes Valerian threatened her family. Executed Lucchesi for adultery but the Salt judged intellectual theft instead. Attempted to kill Valerian at the tribunal. Will try again if given opportunity."

"That is not theory," Cornelius corrected. "That is evidence-supported hypothesis with approximately seventy-three percent certainty."

"Which is considerably less than one hundred percent." Captain Melas finally glanced back. His expression was unreadable in the dim corridor lighting. "You were ninety percent certain about Valerian. That did not end well."

The words landed with physical weight. Cornelius's tail curled tight against his body. The shame was fresh. Immediate. He had been wrong. Had been catastrophically wrong. Had nearly killed an innocent man through arrogant certainty.

But this was different. Had to be different.

"I am aware of my previous error," he said. Each word emerged with careful precision. "I am adjusting methodology accordingly. Current hypothesis accounts for new evidence including Zeph's danger sense and the timing of—"

"The magical headaches I am supposed to trust despite having no documentation or verification." Captain Melas turned fully now. His weathered face showed every hour of the investigation. Every political pressure. Every impossible decision. "You understand my position. Multiple conflicting theories from an analyst I officially removed from the case. A supposed magical sensitivity from a teenage intern with no formal training. All presented as justification for preventative detention of a Tile Family daughter based on speculation."

"Based on logic," Cornelius insisted.

"Based on your logic. Which has been wrong before." The Captain's voice was not unkind. Just exhausted. "I am here as precaution. As professional courtesy because Imelda vouched for you and because your previous errors do not negate your occasional usefulness. But if Chloe Karellas approaches this infirmary, I will speak with her. I will assess her stated purpose. I will deny entry if circumstances warrant. I will not arrest her on your hypothesis alone."

Cornelius wanted to argue. To insist that seventy-three percent certainty was sufficient for protective action. That the cost of inaction outweighed the risk of premature intervention.

But he had lost that argument already. His credibility was spent. His authority revoked. He was here on Captain Melas's tolerance and Imelda's reputation. Nothing more.

Zeph shifted beneath him. The movement was subtle but Cornelius felt it in the changing tension of shoulder muscles. Preparing to speak. Choosing words carefully.

"What if she tries to use Siren magic?" Zeph asked. "To influence the guards? To make them let her in?"

"Then I will be present to observe and intervene if necessary." Captain Melas's hand rested on his belt near the weighted baton. Standard Watch equipment. Non-lethal but effective. "I have worked with Sirens before. I know the signs of active influence."

"Do you?" Cornelius could not help the question. Could not suppress the analytical doubt. "Siren magic operates below conscious perception for most species. You might feel unusually sympathetic to her request. Might find her reasoning compelling. Might decide that allowing brief visit to unconscious patient serves no harm."

"I might." The Captain's expression hardened. "Or I might simply use professional judgment to assess legitimate versus suspicious behavior. You do not have monopoly on analytical thinking, Cornelius."

The rebuke was deserved. Cornelius forced his wings to fold properly. Forced his claws to relax their grip on Zeph's jacket. Forced himself to acknowledge that other people possessed functional intelligence.

"My apologies," he said. "I am... concerned about potential outcomes."

"As am I." Captain Melas turned back toward the infirmary. "Which is why I am standing here instead of processing witness statements. Now be quiet. If someone approaches, I need to hear them before they see me."

Cornelius fell silent. The corridor stretched in both directions. Empty now. Most witnesses had been released hours ago. Only key suspects and essential personnel remained in the lockdown. The building felt hollowed out. Waiting.

Zeph's breathing was audible in the quiet. Deeper than usual. The deliberate rhythm Cornelius had taught him for managing anxiety. In for four counts. Hold for four. Out for four. The pattern helped. Cornelius had observed the technique working multiple times tonight.

Though tonight was rapidly becoming this morning. The hour approached half past two. Nearly six hours since Lucchesi's death. Nearly four since Valerian's poisoning.

Time enough for plans to solidify. For desperate logic to justify terrible action.

If Cornelius's hypothesis was correct.

Seventy-three percent. Not ninety. Not certainty. Just probability weighted by available evidence. By Zeph's musical headache. By Chloe's bare ears at the tribunal. By the timing and targeting that suggested family protection rather than abstract justice.

It was enough to warrant precaution. Enough to justify standing guard over unconscious potential victim. But was it enough to—

Footsteps.

Cornelius's ear-tufts swiveled toward the sound. Coming from the eastern corridor. The direction of the main Rotunda. Measured pace. Not hurried. Not sneaking. Someone walking with purpose but not emergency.

Captain Melas heard it too. His posture shifted. Not aggressive. Just alert. Ready.

The footsteps grew closer. Resolved into visual presence.

Chloe Karellas rounded the corner.

She looked exactly as Cornelius remembered from the tribunal. Young. Composed. Her dark hair was pinned back in formal style that had loosened slightly over the long night. Her gala dress was still immaculate despite hours of lockdown. Sirens maintained appearances even under pressure. Cultural expectation. Personal discipline.

Her eyes were red. Not dramatically so. But enough to indicate recent tears. Her hands twisted together at her waist. The webbing between her fingers caught the lamplight. Translucent. Distinctive.

She walked straight toward the infirmary. Noticed Captain Melas. Stopped approximately ten feet from the entrance.

"Captain." Her voice was steady. Polite. "I need to see Valerian."

Not a request. A statement of need. Cornelius's analytical framework catalogued the phrasing. The certainty. The absence of pleading or negotiation.

Captain Melas did not move from his position. "The infirmary is restricted to authorized medical personnel. I cannot allow visitors at this time."

"He is my partner." Chloe's hands tightened. "I have right to see him. To know his condition. To be present if—" Her voice caught. Genuine emotion or excellent performance. "If his situation worsens."

Partner. The word choice was specific. Deliberate. Designed to invoke both emotional and legal standing.

"I was not informed of any registered partnership," Captain Melas said. His tone remained neutral. Professional. "My records indicate Valerian listed no family or designated contacts in Solterra Bay."

"We kept the relationship private." Chloe's chin lifted. "For professional reasons. He was assistant to a famous author. I am student. People would have assumed inappropriate power dynamics. Would have questioned his ethics. Our discretion protected both reputations."

The logic was plausible. Well-constructed. Exactly the kind of careful reasoning that would make sense to procedural authority.

Cornelius felt his certainty tick upward. Not dramatically. Perhaps seventy-five percent now. Because the lie was too smooth. Too prepared. Valerian had described his relationship history during interrogation. Had mentioned Lucchesi. Had revealed the exploitation and betrayal.

He had not mentioned Chloe. Had not indicated current romantic attachment. Had spoken of isolation and professional ambition. Not partnership.

"I will need verification," Captain Melas said. "Documentation of the relationship. Confirmation from Valerian himself when he regains consciousness. Until then, I cannot—"

"He might not regain consciousness." Chloe took a step forward. Her voice gained intensity. "The healer said his condition is unstable. That the poison damaged something internally. That the next few hours will determine whether he survives."

"All the more reason to maintain medical isolation. To prevent contamination or interference with treatment." The Captain's hand moved fractionally closer to his baton. "I sympathize with your concern. But my orders are clear. No visitors."

"Your orders." Chloe's expression shifted. Something harder underneath the grief. "Your orders are keeping me from the man I love. From being present for him when he needs me. When he—"

Her voice broke. She pressed one hand to her mouth. The other hand reached toward the infirmary doors. The gesture was pleading. Desperate.

And her ears were bare.

Cornelius saw it clearly now. No cuffs. No dampeners. Just small silver earrings with blue stones. Decorative rather than functional. The same configuration she had worn at the tribunal.

His wings spread slightly. The movement was involuntary. Physical response to analytical conclusion solidifying.

She was not wearing dampeners. Was not suppressing her magic. Was allowing—was encouraging—her Siren nature to influence the emotional resonance of this conversation.

Captain Melas might feel unusual sympathy. Might find her grief compelling. Might decide that brief compassionate visit served minimal harm.

"Please." Chloe's voice dropped to whisper. "Please let me see him."

The word carried weight. Texture. Not magical compulsion. Nothing so crude. Just emotional truth rendered through Siren vocal control. The sound made Cornelius want to help her. Made him feel her pain as immediate. Urgent.

Made him want to make exception.

He was library dragon with considerable resistance to magical influence. If he felt the pull, Captain Melas—fully human with compassionate nature—would feel it significantly more.

"You should let her in," Zeph said quietly.

Cornelius's head whipped around. "What?"

Zeph was not looking at Cornelius. His gaze was fixed on Chloe. His expression was strange. Distant. The way he looked when processing something through his developing guardian senses.

"She needs to see him," Zeph continued. His voice was flat. Analytical. "She is not going to leave until she does. She will keep trying. Keep pushing. Eventually someone will let her in."

"That is precisely why we are preventing access," Cornelius hissed.

"No. I mean..." Zeph's hand moved to his temple. Not pressing. Just touching. "The headache is back. Musical. Like at the tribunal. But it is not danger this time. It is... determination? Like she has already decided. Already committed. She is going to do this whether we stop her here or not."

Cornelius felt cold certainty slide down his spine. "Then we maintain barrier. We keep her away from Valerian until—"

"Until what? Until she finds another route? Another method? Until she influences different guard during different shift?" Zeph's dark eyes finally met Cornelius's golden gaze. "Or until we let her in and actually see what she does?"

The suggestion hung in the quiet corridor.

Captain Melas had not moved. His attention was still on Chloe. But Cornelius noticed the slight tilt of his head. The minute adjustment that indicated he was listening to the conversation behind him.

"You are proposing we allow potential murderer access to intended victim," Cornelius said slowly.

"I am proposing we confirm your theory instead of just standing here arguing about it." Zeph's voice was steady. "She is either here to mourn her partner or here to finish the job. If we let her in under controlled circumstances, we find out which."

"And if she succeeds in killing him during those controlled circumstances?"

"Then we stop her before she can." Zeph gestured toward Captain Melas. "We have Watch Captain right here. We have you watching. We have guards. And if she tries to use more Judgment Salt, we will see it. We will intervene."

The logic was sound. Terrible. Pragmatic. Exactly the kind of reasoning Cornelius himself might have employed before his spectacular failure at the tribunal.

Before he learned that elegant theories could kill innocent people.

"Captain Melas will not agree to this," Cornelius said.

"Actually." The Captain's voice was quiet. Thoughtful. "It has merit."

Cornelius's wings flared fully. "You cannot be serious."

"I am extremely serious." Captain Melas turned to face them partially. His expression was calculating. Professional. "Current situation: We have hypothesis that Chloe Karellas attempted to murder Valerian. We have no proof. No evidence that would support arrest or formal charges. No grounds for detention. If I deny her access and she departs, we learn nothing. We wait for her next attempt with no additional information or preparation."

"Or we maintain defensive position until you gather actual evidence through proper investigation," Cornelius argued.

"What investigation? What evidence?" The Captain's voice held frustrated edge. "I have no witnesses to her administering poison. No documentation linking her to Judgment Salt acquisition. No confession. Nothing except your logic and the boy's magical headaches."

"Guardian sense," Cornelius corrected automatically.

"Which I cannot verify. Cannot document. Cannot present to Mayor or Tile Families as justification for action." Captain Melas looked back at Chloe. She was still standing in that pleading posture. Still waiting for answer. "But if I allow supervised visit. If I maintain direct observation. If she attempts something actionable in my presence..."

"Then you have evidence," Zeph finished.

"Then I have grounds for intervention based on witnessed behavior rather than hypothesis."

Cornelius's analytical mind spun through implications. Through risks and potential outcomes. Through everything that could go catastrophically wrong with this plan.

"You are proposing to use Valerian as bait," he said.

"I am proposing to confirm or eliminate him as target." Captain Melas's jaw tightened. "Either Chloe visits unconscious partner and behaves appropriately, in which case your theory is wrong and we reassess. Or she attempts something suspicious, in which case I have justification to detain her and press charges. Either way, we gain information."

"Or she kills him before you can intervene."

"That is why you will be watching." The Captain's gaze was steady. "Your forensic vision. Your ability to identify substances and compounds. If she produces Judgment Salt or any other poison, you alert me immediately. I stop her before administration."

"I am thirty feet away down a dim corridor."

"Then move closer." Captain Melas gestured toward a recessed doorway approximately fifteen feet from the infirmary. Empty office or storage room. Shadowed. Adequate concealment for small dragon. "Position yourself there. Maintain visual line through the open door. The moment you see anything suspicious, you signal. I act."

Cornelius looked at the doorway. At the angle it provided. At the clear line of sight into the infirmary once the doors opened.

At the terrible elegant logic of using observation to generate evidence.

"This is dangerous," he said.

"Yes."

"This could result in Valerian's death."

"Many things could result in Valerian's death. Including denying access and waiting for Chloe to try again under less controlled circumstances." Captain Melas's expression was grim. "I am making tactical choice. Use current opportunity to confirm threat and gather evidence. Or lose opportunity and wait for next attempt with no additional information."

Zeph was very still on the bench where he sat. His hand had dropped from his temple. His eyes were closed. Breathing in the four-count pattern.

"What does your sense tell you?" Cornelius asked quietly.

Zeph opened his eyes. "That she is going to do it. Going to try. Whether we let her in now or she finds another way later. At least this way we are ready."

The certainty in his voice was absolute. Not analytical. Not theoretical. Just bone-deep knowing.

Guardian sense. Lamassu-touched awareness of threat and intention. The same sense that had screamed warning when Valerian reached for poisoned water.

Cornelius adjusted his spectacles with one claw. The familiar gesture helped settle his thoughts into working order.

Seventy-three percent certainty that Chloe was the killer. Perhaps eighty percent now with the bare ears and false partnership claim. Sufficient probability to warrant action. To justify risk.

"If I see poison," he said carefully, "if I identify Judgment Salt or any harmful compound, I will alert you immediately. You will stop her before administration."

"Agreed."

"And if I am wrong. If she truly is here to mourn. If my hypothesis is incorrect and we have just allowed grief-stricken partner access to dying loved one..." Cornelius's tail curled tight. "Then we will have caused unnecessary pain for no purpose."

"Then we will have eliminated suspect and redirected investigation appropriately." Captain Melas turned back toward Chloe. "Take your position. Stay hidden. Watch carefully."

Cornelius spread his wings. Glided from Zeph's shoulder to the recessed doorway. The angle was adequate. Not perfect. But sufficient for monitoring infirmary interior once doors opened.

He settled onto the stone threshold. Adjusted his spectacles. Focused his forensic vision.

Captain Melas walked toward Chloe. Her expression shifted from pleading desperation to cautious hope.

"I will allow brief visit," the Captain said. "Under strict conditions. You will be supervised. You will not touch medical equipment. You will not interfere with treatment. You will leave when I instruct. Any violation results in immediate removal and potential charges. Do you understand?"

Chloe nodded. Tears tracked down her face. Gratitude. Relief.

Cornelius watched her ears. Still bare. Still allowing influence.

Captain Melas gestured to the guards. "Open the door. Remain stationed inside. If I give signal, restrain Miss Karellas immediately."

The guards moved to comply. The wooden doors swung inward.

Beyond them, Cornelius saw converted council chamber. Saw cot against far wall where Valerian lay unconscious. Saw healer seated near the bedside with diagnostic equipment and notations.

Saw Chloe Karellas step across the threshold with Captain Melas close behind.

Saw the door remain open. Perfect sight line from concealed position.

The trap was set.

Now they would discover whether Cornelius's seventy-three percent certainty was sufficient.

Whether his adjusted methodology was improvement over previous arrogance.

Whether they would prevent murder or witness it.

Cornelius forced himself to breathe. To watch. To trust that logic and observation and carefully maintained distance would be enough this time.

Would have to be enough.

# Chapter 17

# Chapter 17

Cornelius pressed himself against the stone threshold of the recessed doorway. The position was not dignified. Dragons were not designed for lurking in shadows like common alley cats. But dignity was considerably less important than effective observation.

The infirmary doors stood open. Adequate sight line. He could see Chloe's back as she moved toward the cot where Valerian lay unconscious. Could see Captain Melas positioned near the entrance with both guards flanking. Could see the healer rising from their chair with cautious professional courtesy.

Could not see Chloe's hands.

The angle was wrong. Her body blocked the precise view Cornelius needed to identify substances or detect poison preparation. He had forensic vision. Could analyze compound composition. Could determine age of materials and chemical properties through focused observation.

But only if he could actually see what he was meant to analyze.

Cornelius adjusted his position. Shifted his weight forward. The stone was cold beneath his claws. Uncomfortable. He ignored the physical irritation and concentrated on visual access.

Chloe reached the bedside. The healer stepped back slightly. Giving space. Respecting grief. The young Siren's shoulders trembled. She pressed one webbed hand to her mouth.

"I am so sorry," she whispered.

The words were barely audible. But Cornelius was library dragon. His hearing had evolved for detecting the rustle of turning pages from three floors away. For identifying footsteps in distant corridors. For cataloguing every sound in his archival domain.

Human whispers at fifteen feet were entirely within normal perceptual range.

"I am so sorry," Chloe said again. Her voice broke. "I never wanted this. Never wanted you to—"

She stopped. Drew breath. Cornelius watched her hand drop from her mouth to reach toward something at her waist. The movement was careful. Deliberate. Not the gesture of someone overcome by emotion.

The gesture of someone executing planned action.

Cornelius's analytical processes accelerated. She was reaching for something. Something concealed in her dress perhaps. Something she had carried into the infirmary despite the guards. Despite the supervision.

Something small enough to hide. Valuable enough to risk discovery.

His certainty ticked upward. Eighty percent now. Possibly eighty-five.

He needed better visual access. Needed to see her hands. Needed to identify what she was retrieving before she could administer it.

Cornelius spread his wings. The movement was minimal. Just enough to shift his position fractionally to the left. The new angle provided slightly improved view past her shoulder.

He focused his forensic vision. Concentrated on the space near her waist where her hand had moved.

There.

A small vial. Glass. Approximately two inches in length. Stoppered with cork. Containing crystalline granules that caught the lamplight.

Blue-violet crystalline granules.

Judgment Salt.

Cornelius's chest constricted. The theory was confirmed. The hypothesis proven. Chloe Karellas had brought poison into the infirmary. Was preparing to administer it to unconscious victim. Was moments away from completing what she had started at the tribunal.

He needed to alert Captain Melas immediately. Needed to signal danger. Needed to—

"I did not want to do this again." Chloe's voice was ragged now. Thick with tears. "But you survived. You survived and that means you are not as guilty as he was. Not as deeply corrupt. But you are still guilty. Still contaminated. Still threatening everything I love."

She held the vial up to the lamplight. Examined the contents with terrible focus.

"The first dose was not enough," she continued. Speaking to unconscious Valerian as though he could hear. As though this was confession rather than execution. "Your guilt was not strong enough. Not absolute enough. So I have to try again. Have to make certain. Have to finish this properly."

Cornelius felt cold certainty replace analytical speculation. She was not here to mourn. Was not here to comfort dying partner. She was here to kill.

Was here to correct her previous attempt's failure.

He needed to move. Needed to alert. Needed to—

Captain Melas was already moving.

The Captain's hand went to his baton. His body shifted into intervention stance. The guards responded immediately. Moving toward Chloe with professional efficiency.

"Step away from the patient," Captain Melas said. His voice was hard. Absolute. "Put down the vial. Put your hands where I can see them."

Chloe froze. The vial was still in her hand. Still uncorked. Still containing enough Judgment Salt to kill if administered properly.

"Captain." Her voice shifted. No longer broken with grief. Steady now. Controlled. "I need you to understand. This is necessary. This is justice. This is—"

"This is attempted murder." Melas took another step forward. "Put down the vial. Final warning."

Cornelius saw Chloe's shoulders tense. Saw her hand tighten around the glass. Saw the calculations happening behind her composed expression.

She was Siren. Young. Untrained in combat. But Sirens possessed voices that could shatter stone. Could compel action. Could turn guards against their captain with sufficient desperation and properly applied magical influence.

If she screamed—truly screamed with full Siren power—the consequences would be catastrophic. The infirmary would collapse. The guards would be incapacitated. Valerian would die in the chaos.

And Chloe would escape.

Cornelius needed to prevent that outcome. Needed to stop her before she could employ her voice as weapon. But he was small dragon fifteen feet away concealed in doorway. By the time he reached her, she would have already acted.

Unless he provided Captain Melas with different approach.

Unless he remembered something relevant from his extensive archival knowledge.

Something about Sirens. About their nature. About the codes and customs that governed their magic and their honor.

Cornelius's mind raced through catalogued information. Through volumes read and indexed. Through obscure legal texts and cultural documentation. Through the vast accumulated knowledge that constituted his hoard.

There.

Siren Law. The ancient protocols. The binding traditions.

He had read about them years ago. Had filed the information in mental archives as potentially useful but not immediately relevant. Had not expected to need detailed knowledge of Siren legal customs during his comfortable library existence.

But he needed that knowledge now.

Needed it desperately.

Cornelius withdrew from his observation position. Moved silently down the corridor toward where Zeph stood near Captain Melas's previous location. The young man's eyes tracked his movement. Questioning. Concerned.

"We have a problem," Cornelius said quietly. Keeping his voice below Siren hearing range. "Chloe has Judgment Salt. She is preparing to administer it. Captain Melas is attempting intervention but if she uses her voice—"

"She will bring down the building." Zeph's hand pressed against his temple. "I can feel it. The musical thing. It is building. Getting ready to—" He stopped. Swallowed. "She is scared. Desperate. She will scream if they try to grab her."

"Correct assessment." Cornelius's tail lashed once. "Physical restraint is not viable option. Siren scream at that proximity would cause structural damage. Would incapacitate guards. Would create sufficient chaos for escape or for completing her attack on Valerian."

"So what do we do?" Zeph's voice was strained. "We cannot just let her kill him."

"No. We cannot." Cornelius adjusted his spectacles. The familiar gesture helped organize his thoughts. "We need alternative approach. We need to bind her through different mechanism."

"What mechanism?"

"Siren Law." Cornelius began moving toward the service corridor. Toward the small preparation room where City Hall staff maintained supplies. "Ancient protocols. Cultural codes. Binding traditions that govern Siren behavior and magical honor."

Zeph followed. "I do not understand. What kind of protocols?"

"Sirens are governed by hospitality law. By codes of conduct regarding family, healing, and sacred spaces." Cornelius reached the preparation room door. Tested the handle. Locked. He gestured impatiently. "Do you have lockpicks?"

"Why would I have lockpicks?"

"You are sixteen-year-old boy. I assumed—"

"I am library intern. Not criminal." Zeph pulled a thin metal tool from his pocket. "I have book-repair kits. Sometimes they work on locks."

Cornelius did not ask why Zeph carried book-repair tools everywhere. The boy had been excellent student. Had absorbed proper archival practices. The tools were appropriate precaution.

The lock clicked open.

Cornelius pushed through the door. The preparation room was small. Utilitarian. Lined with shelves holding linens, medical supplies, and—

There.

Silver tea service. Tray. Pot. Cups. The equipment used for serving civic officials during council meetings. For providing refreshment during tedious administrative sessions.

For offering hospitality.

"Grab the tray," Cornelius instructed.

Zeph lifted the silver tray from the shelf. "What are we doing?"

"We are invoking Siren Law regarding hospitality and the tending of sick." Cornelius examined the tea pot. Empty. That was acceptable. The symbolism mattered more than actual beverage. "According to ancient protocols, a Siren who enters space dedicated to healing—who approaches someone ill or injured—cannot refuse offered hospitality without violating sacred obligation."

"Cannot refuse tea?" Zeph's voice was skeptical. "That is your plan? We offer her tea and she has to stop trying to kill Valerian?"

"Not merely tea. Hospitality." Cornelius's claws tapped against the silver surface. "The cultural prohibition is absolute. A Siren who refuses hospitality while tending the sick risks losing their honor. Their standing. Their magical connection to water and voice. The consequences are severe enough that no traditional Siren would violate the custom."

"But Chloe already murdered someone. She poisoned Lucchesi. She tried to kill Valerian. Why would she care about tea protocol?"

"Because she murdered for family. For protecting those she loves. For upholding what she perceives as moral duty." Cornelius's tail swished in thinking-rhythm. "She is not acting against Siren nature. She is acting from it. From the fierce protectiveness that defines her species. From the codes that govern proper behavior."

"So those codes include the tea thing?"

"The hospitality obligation. Yes." Cornelius hopped onto the tray. Arranged himself with maximum dignified effect. "If we enter the infirmary bearing clear symbols of hospitality. If we offer refreshment while she tends to unconscious patient. If we invoke the ancient protocols correctly. She will be bound. Will be unable to refuse. Will be compelled to accept and to cease her attack."

Zeph stared at him. "That is insane."

"That is civilized." Cornelius adjusted his spectacles. "We cannot restrain her physically. Cannot risk her using voice as weapon. But we can bind her through culture. Through the codes she was raised to honor. Through the obligations that run deeper than conscious choice."

"What if you are wrong?"

"Then we will have offered tea to potential murderer. And we will need to attempt less elegant intervention." Cornelius's wings folded with precision. "But I am approximately eighty-seven percent certain this will work."

Zeph's hand trembled slightly on the tray. "Eighty-seven percent."

"Considerably better than my previous certainty regarding Valerian." Cornelius met his gaze steadily. "I am learning caution. But some situations require action despite incomplete certainty. This is one of those situations."

The musical tension in Zeph's expression—the ozone scent that accompanied his danger sense—was strong. Present. But not peaking. Not screaming immediate threat the way it had when Valerian reached for poisoned water.

"Your headache," Cornelius said. "What does it tell you?"

Zeph closed his eyes. Breathed in the four-count pattern. "That she is about to do something terrible. That we need to stop her. That—" He opened his eyes. "That your plan is completely ridiculous but possibly the only thing that will work."

"Guardian sense is remarkably useful," Cornelius observed. "Even when the guidance it provides is qualified."

"Yeah. Great. So I carry you on a tea tray into a room with a murderer and we ask if she wants refreshment." Zeph lifted the tray. "This is the most library-dragon thing I have ever heard."

"Thank you."

"That was not compliment."

"I am choosing to interpret it as one." Cornelius settled his weight carefully. The tray was adequate. Not ideal. But sufficient for processional entrance. "We need to inform Captain Melas of the plan."

"He is going to think we are insane."

"Quite possibly." Cornelius's tail curled around the tea pot for stability. "But he is practical man. He will recognize that insane plan is preferable to Siren scream collapsing municipal building."

They moved back toward the infirmary. The corridor was quiet. Empty. Most witnesses had been released hours ago. Only the essential personnel remained. Only those directly involved in the investigation.

Only those who would witness whether Cornelius's eighty-seven percent certainty was sufficient.

Captain Melas was still in the doorway. His posture was tense. One hand on his baton. The guards had not moved closer to Chloe. Were maintaining position. Waiting for direction.

Inside the infirmary, Chloe stood frozen at Valerian's bedside. The vial was still in her hand. Still uncorked. Still ready.

Cornelius caught Captain Melas's eye. Gestured with one wing toward the corridor. The Captain's expression shifted through several complicated emotions. Confusion. Irritation. Exhausted resignation.

He stepped back from the doorway. Moved toward where Cornelius and Zeph waited with their silver tea service.

"What," the Captain said slowly, "are you doing?"

"Preventing structural collapse and apprehending suspect." Cornelius kept his voice low. "Chloe has Judgment Salt. She is preparing to administer second dose to Valerian. If you attempt physical restraint, she will scream. Full Siren power. The consequences will be catastrophic."

"I am aware of the risk." Captain Melas's jaw tightened. "I am attempting to establish verbal control. To de-escalate. To—"

"She will not de-escalate. She believes this is necessary justice. Believes she is protecting her family. Believes Valerian deserves death." Cornelius's claws tapped against the tray. "She will fight. Will use any method available. Including voice."

"So you propose we serve her tea?" The Captain's voice held thread of hysteria. "We politely request she stop murdering people and offer refreshment?"

"We invoke Siren Law regarding hospitality and sacred obligation." Cornelius explained the principle. The cultural prohibition. The consequences of violation. "She cannot refuse. Cannot maintain her attack. Must accept the offered hospitality or risk losing everything that defines her as Siren."

Captain Melas stared at him. Then at Zeph. Then back at the tea tray.

"This is your plan."

"This is my plan."

"Based on ancient Siren cultural customs that may or may not be binding in modern context."

"Based on thoroughly documented legal and anthropological precedent maintained across centuries of Siren civilization." Cornelius's tail swished. "I have read extensively on the subject. The obligation is absolute. The prohibition is sacred."

"And if you are wrong?"

"Then I will be wrong with tea service instead of collapsed building." Cornelius adjusted his spectacles. "Do you have superior alternative?"

The Captain was silent. His gaze moved back toward the infirmary. Toward Chloe standing at the bedside with poison in hand. Toward the guards who could not intervene without triggering disaster.

"No," he said finally. "I do not have superior alternative."

"Then we proceed with my plan."

"Your eighty-seven percent certain plan."

"Eighty-eight percent now." Cornelius had performed additional mental calculations. "The probability increases with each moment Chloe does not flee or attack. She is hesitating. Experiencing internal conflict. The cultural codes are already affecting her behavior even before we invoke them directly."

Captain Melas closed his eyes. Breathed out slowly. "I am going to regret this."

"Quite possibly." Cornelius settled deeper onto the tray. "But you will regret it with intact building and living witnesses."

"That is remarkably poor reassurance."

"I am library dragon. Not therapy professional."

Zeph made sound that might have been laugh or sob. His hands were steady on the tray despite the ozone scent that indicated his danger sense was still active. Still processing threat. Still uncertain about outcome.

But he was here. Was following Cornelius's lead. Was trusting the eighty-eight percent certainty and the ridiculous civilized plan.

Two liabilities working together. Making their own investigation. Taking action based on knowledge and desperation and stubborn refusal to fail again.

"We enter together," Cornelius said. "Captain Melas leads. Zeph carries the tray. I remain visible and unthreatening. We approach with clear symbol of hospitality. We offer refreshment. We invoke the sacred obligation. We give Chloe opportunity to choose between honoring her culture and completing her murder."

"And if she chooses murder?" Captain Melas asked.

"Then we will have learned important information about the limits of cultural prohibition." Cornelius's wings spread slightly. "But I do not believe she will. I believe—eighty-eight percent certainty—that the codes run deep enough to override even protective desperation."

"You are betting Valerian's life on cultural anthropology."

"I am betting Valerian's life on the fundamental nature of what it means to be Siren. On the bonds that define identity and honor and magical connection." Cornelius's tail curled tighter around the tea pot. "It is better wager than attempting to physically restrain someone whose voice can shatter stone."

Captain Melas was quiet for long moment. Then he nodded once. Short. Decisive.

"We proceed. But if this fails—if she attacks or screams or attempts to administer that poison—I will act immediately. Guards will restrain her regardless of consequences. Is that understood?"

"Perfectly understood." Cornelius adjusted his position on the tray. "Ready when you are."

"I am not remotely ready." The Captain moved toward the infirmary entrance. "But I am also out of better options. So we attempt insane library dragon plan. And we hope eighty-eight percent is sufficient."

Zeph lifted the tray. His breathing was still controlled. Four-count pattern. Managing anxiety through technique Cornelius had taught him weeks ago.

Good student. Excellent intern. Potentially remarkable partner if they both survived the next five minutes.

They moved toward the open infirmary doors. Toward Chloe and her poison. Toward unconscious Valerian and the guards and the terrible moment of testing whether civilization was stronger than desperation.

Toward tea service as weapon. As binding. As the most library-dragon solution to murder that Cornelius had ever devised.

He certainly hoped he was right.

Eighty-eight percent was considerably less than certainty. But it was the best calculation available with current data.

It would have to be enough.

Captain Melas stepped through the doorway. Zeph followed with the silver tray held steady. Cornelius perched in formal position. Wings folded. Spectacles precisely aligned. The very image of dignified professional service.

Chloe looked up from Valerian's bedside. Her eyes widened. The vial was still in her hand.

"Miss Karellas," Cornelius said clearly. His voice carried the full formal weight of library authority. Of ancient protocol. Of civilization meeting chaos with tea service and sacred obligation. "We have brought refreshment. Will you accept our hospitality?"

# Chapter 18

The infirmary was too quiet.

Cornelius registered this fact as Zeph carried him across the threshold on the silver tray. The healer had withdrawn to the far corner. The guards stood at attention near the wall. Captain Melas moved with deliberate calm toward the center of the room.

And Chloe Karellas stood frozen at Valerian's bedside with an uncorked vial of Judgment Salt in her trembling hand.

She stared at them. At the tea service. At Cornelius perched formally on the tray with his wings folded and his spectacles precisely aligned.

"Miss Karellas," Cornelius said again. His voice carried the full weight of library authority. Of ancient protocol. Of civilization meeting chaos with proper hospitality. "We have brought refreshment. Will you accept?"

Chloe's mouth opened. Closed. Her webbed fingers tightened around the vial. The blue-violet crystals caught the lamplight. Enough poison to kill. To finish what she had started.

But she did not move toward Valerian. Did not tip the vial. Did not speak.

Cornelius watched her ears. Still bare. Still lacking the dampeners that would suppress Siren influence. But her voice remained silent. Her magic constrained not by physical limitation but by something deeper.

By the sacred obligation.

"This is healing space," Cornelius continued. Keeping his tone formal. Precise. "You are tending to one who is ill. We offer hospitality as is proper. As is traditional. As is required by the ancient codes that govern your people."

Chloe's expression shifted. Horror. Understanding. The terrible recognition of being caught not by force but by culture. By the laws she had been raised to honor. By obligations that ran deeper than conscious choice.

"You cannot," she whispered. Her voice was raw. Broken. "You cannot do this. This is not—this is not fair."

"Fair is irrelevant." Cornelius adjusted his spectacles with one claw. "The protocols exist independent of individual circumstance. A Siren who tends the sick must accept offered hospitality. To refuse would violate sacred trust. Would risk losing honor. Standing. Voice itself."

"I am not tending him." Chloe's hand shook. The vial wavered. "I am executing him. I am finishing what must be done. What justice requires."

"You are standing at the bedside of unconscious patient in designated healing space." Cornelius gestured with his wing toward the converted council chamber. Toward the medical equipment. Toward the healer watching from the corner. "The location defines the obligation. Your stated intent is irrelevant to the sacred law."

Captain Melas moved closer. Not threatening. Just positioning himself between Chloe and the door. Cutting off potential escape. The guards shifted in response. Ready. Waiting.

Chloe noticed. Her shoulders tensed. The musical quality Zeph had described—the building pressure before Siren scream—gathered in the air. Cornelius felt it as wrongness. As atmospheric distortion. As the moment before glass shattered.

"Do not," Cornelius said quietly. "A scream would collapse this room. Would harm innocent people. Would accomplish nothing except adding more deaths to your burden."

"My burden." Chloe's laugh was brittle. "You know nothing of burden. Nothing of what I carry. What I must do to protect—" She stopped. Pressed her free hand against her mouth.

Zeph stood very still near the doorway. The silver tray was absolutely steady in his grip despite the ozone scent that marked his danger sense. His breathing followed the four-count pattern. Managing fear through technique. Through discipline.

Good student. Excellent partner.

Cornelius returned his attention to Chloe. To the vial in her hand. To the terrible equation of hospitality versus murder.

"The tea grows cold," he said. "Will you accept our offering? Will you honor the ancient protocols? Or will you violate sacred law and risk everything that defines you as Siren?"

The silence stretched. Chloe stared at them. At the tea service. At Cornelius perched like formal butler ready to pour.

Then her hand lowered. Slowly. Incrementally. The vial moved away from Valerian's unconscious form. Moved toward the side table next to the cot.

She set it down with careful precision. The cork remained out. The crystals still accessible. Still ready. But separated from immediate victim by crucial distance.

"I accept," she whispered. "I accept your hospitality."

The words carried weight beyond simple agreement. Carried binding force. Carried the full authority of Siren Law enacted through conscious choice.

Cornelius felt tension release from his spine. Eighty-eight percent certainty had been sufficient. The culture had held. The protocols had bound.

"Excellent," he said. His tail uncurled from around the tea pot. "Zeph. Please pour."

Zeph carried the tray to the small side table opposite where the vial rested. His movements were careful. Deliberate. He set the tray down. Lifted the pot. Poured tea into two cups with hands that only trembled slightly.

One cup for Chloe. One for himself as representative of the offering party.

Cornelius hopped from the tray to the table surface. Positioned himself between the tea service and the poison. Between civilization and murder.

"Please," he said. Gesturing toward the chair near Valerian's bedside. "Sit. You must be exhausted."

Chloe stared at him. Then at the chair. Then at Captain Melas who watched with expression of professional assessment. Waiting to see whether she would comply. Whether the hospitality would hold.

She sat. Slowly. Her gala dress pooled around her like dark water. Her webbed hands folded in her lap. Her bare ears caught the lamplight.

Zeph lifted one cup. Offered it to her. The porcelain was fine. Delicate. The kind used for civic officials during administrative meetings. For serving refreshment during tedious council sessions.

For binding dangerous people through ancient custom.

Chloe accepted the cup. Her fingers wrapped around the warm porcelain. She did not drink. Just held it. Stared into the steam rising from the surface.

"This is insane," she said. "This entire situation is insane."

"Murder generally is." Cornelius settled onto his haunches. Folded his wings. "Particularly when executed through rare alchemical compounds in public settings."

"I did not—" She stopped. Drew breath. "It was not supposed to be public. Was supposed to be quiet. Private. Just him understanding in his final moments. Understanding what he had done. What he deserved."

"Lucchesi." Cornelius kept his voice gentle. "You poisoned Lucchesi at the gala."

Chloe nodded. The cup trembled in her hands. "He was guilty. Profoundly guilty. The Salt proved it. When he died so quickly. So absolutely. It confirmed everything."

"Confirmed that he was guilty of intellectual theft." Cornelius adjusted his spectacles. "Of stealing Valerian's work. Of exploiting vulnerable assistant for personal gain. The Salt judged that crime. That profound betrayal."

"No." Chloe's voice was sharp. "No. He was guilty of adultery. Of threatening my family. Of corrupting what should have been sacred. That is what the Salt judged. That is why he died."

Cornelius's analytical processes engaged fully. The certainty—the absolute conviction in her voice—indicated genuine belief. She truly thought Lucchesi had died for adultery. Truly believed the Salt had confirmed that specific guilt.

She did not know about the ghostwriting. Did not know about Valerian's exploitation. Did not understand that Judgment Salt responded to strongest guilt rather than intended accusation.

"Miss Karellas," Cornelius said carefully. "May I ask a question?"

She laughed. Bitter. Broken. "You have me trapped with tea service and ancient law. You may ask whatever you wish."

"Who told you Lucchesi was having affair with your mother?"

The cup stopped trembling. Chloe's expression went absolutely still.

"I did not say it was my mother."

"You said he threatened your family. Said he corrupted what should be sacred. Said he deserved death for adultery." Cornelius's tail curled in thinking-rhythm. "The logical conclusion is that he was involved with married member of your immediate family. Your mother is married to Pavlos Karellas. Prominent shipping magnate. Powerful man who would constitute valuable alliance for ambitious author seeking social advancement."

Chloe set the cup down. Her hands were shaking too much to hold it safely. "Valerian told me. Three months ago. He said Lucchesi was destroying my family. Said he was using my mother. Said someone needed to stop him before the affair became public. Before it ruined everything."

Cornelius felt cold certainty settle in his chest. "Valerian told you."

"He was trying to help. Was trying to warn me. Was—" Her voice cracked. "He loved her too. Loved my mother. They were together properly. Respectfully. Planning to approach my father when the time was right. When Lucchesi's hold was broken."

The pieces shifted. Rearranged. The pattern Cornelius had constructed collapsed and reformed into new configuration.

Valerian had lied to Chloe. Had told her Lucchesi was the threat. Was the affair partner. Was the corruption that endangered her family.

But Valerian was the one involved with Irene Karellas. Was the one threatening the family stability. Was the one who would benefit from Lucchesi's death.

Had manipulated young Siren into committing murder on his behalf.

"He used you," Cornelius said quietly.

"No." Chloe's voice was immediate. Defensive. "No. He would not. He loved me. Loved my mother. He was trying to help. To protect. To—"

"He is Sphinx-kin," Cornelius interrupted. "Sphinxes cannot lie without physical response. But they can tell selective truths. Can frame facts in misleading context. Can use honesty as weapon."

"You are wrong." Chloe stood. The chair scraped against stone floor. "You are wrong about him. About everything. Valerian is good. Is honest. Is—"

"Is the one who was actually having affair with your mother." Captain Melas spoke for the first time since entering. His voice was tired. Sad. "We have evidence. Correspondence. Testimony. Valerian and Irene Karellas maintained romantic relationship for approximately eight months. Lucchesi was not involved."

Chloe stared at him. Then at Cornelius. Then at Valerian's unconscious form on the cot.

"No," she whispered. "No. That cannot be. If that were true then I—then the Salt would have—" Understanding crashed across her expression. "Then I killed the wrong man."

"You killed guilty man," Cornelius said gently. "Lucchesi was profoundly guilty. Just not of the crime you intended to punish. The Salt responded to his deepest guilt. To the intellectual theft. To the exploitation of vulnerable assistant. You executed him for adultery but he died for fraud."

"And Valerian." Chloe's voice was hollow. "I tried to kill Valerian because I thought he was lover too. Thought he was backup. Thought I needed to eliminate both threats to protect my family. But if Lucchesi was not the lover then Valerian was not backup. Valerian was—" Her hand pressed against her mouth. "Was the actual threat."

"Was the one who manipulated you into murdering his rival." Captain Melas moved closer. Not threatening. Just present. "Used your protective instincts. Your Siren nature. Your fierce loyalty to family. Turned you into weapon against man he hated. Man who had exploited him professionally."

Chloe was crying now. Silent tears tracking down her face. "He told me Lucchesi deserved death. Told me the Salt would prove guilt. Told me I would be protecting everything I loved. And I believed him. I trusted him. I—"

She turned toward the side table. Toward the uncorked vial of Judgment Salt sitting next to the rejected tea.

Cornelius saw her hand move. Saw the intention crystallize. Saw the terrible logic of young woman who had just learned she had been used. Manipulated. Turned into murderer for someone else's revenge.

"Chloe," he said sharply. "Do not."

But she was Siren. Was fast when motivated. Her webbed fingers closed around the vial. Lifted it toward her mouth.

"I am guilty!" Her voice was anguished. "I killed innocent man! I was weapon! I am contaminated! The Salt should judge me! Should—"

"Zeph!" Cornelius's wing swept across the table. Caught the cup. Sent tea splashing toward Chloe's hand.

The hot liquid hit her wrist. She flinched. The vial wavered.

Zeph was already moving. His hand shot out. Grabbed her arm. The sudden contact—the physical intervention—broke her focus. The vial slipped from her fingers.

It fell. Tumbled through air. Cornelius watched it arc toward the stone floor with terrible slow certainty.

This was going to be loud.

The glass shattered. Blue-violet crystals scattered across the floor. Some landed on the carpet beneath Valerian's cot. Immediately began smoking. The fabric hissed. Dissolved where the Salt touched.

Proof of potency. Of lethality. Of how quickly it would have killed if Chloe had succeeded in drinking it.

Guards rushed forward. Captain Melas barked orders. The healer scrambled to contain the spilled compound. To prevent further damage.

Chloe collapsed. Not from poison. From despair. From the terrible weight of understanding what she had done. What she had been used for. What she had nearly become.

Zeph caught her before she hit the floor. Lowered her carefully into the chair. His face was pale. His hands shook. The ozone scent was overwhelming now. His danger sense had screamed warning just in time.

Just barely in time.

Cornelius hopped from the table to Zeph's shoulder. Pressed against his neck in the approximation of comfort. "Well done."

"I felt it spike." Zeph's voice was unsteady. "The musical thing. The danger. It was—" He stopped. Swallowed. "We almost lost her."

"But we did not." Cornelius adjusted his spectacles. "You warned me. I intervened. She survived. That is sufficient."

Captain Melas crouched in front of Chloe. His expression was gentle despite the professional authority. "Chloe Karellas. I am placing you under arrest for the murder of Fabrizio Lucchesi and the attempted murder of Valerian. You will be taken into custody. You will be allowed legal representation. Do you understand?"

Chloe nodded. Silent. Broken.

"I did not know," she whispered. "I truly did not know. Valerian said—he said Lucchesi was destroying my family. I believed him. I trusted him. I thought I was protecting them. Thought I was doing right thing. Necessary thing."

"I understand." Captain Melas gestured to the guards. "But understanding does not erase consequence. You killed someone. You must answer for that action regardless of motive."

The guards moved forward with restraints. Gentle but firm. Chloe did not resist. Just sat passively while they secured her hands. While they lifted her from the chair. While they began escorting her toward the door.

She stopped near the threshold. Turned back toward where Valerian lay unconscious.

"Will he survive?" Her voice was small. Young. "Will he wake up?"

The healer looked up from containing the spilled Salt. "His condition is stable. The poison affected him but did not kill. He should regain consciousness within a few hours."

"Will you tell him—" Chloe's voice broke. "Will you tell him I am sorry? That I did not understand? That I—"

"We will tell him you were arrested for murdering the man he wanted dead." Captain Melas's voice was not unkind. Just honest. "We will tell him you were manipulated. Used. That you acted from protective instinct rather than malice. Beyond that, the communication is between you and him. Not our responsibility."

Chloe nodded. The guards led her out. Her footsteps faded down the corridor. Heading toward holding cells. Toward formal processing. Toward whatever justice waited for young woman who had committed murder while believing it was protection.

The infirmary fell silent again.

Cornelius remained on Zeph's shoulder. Watching the healer work. Watching Captain Melas make notations in his leather-bound notebook. Watching the broken glass and scattered crystals being carefully collected into sealed container.

"She is nineteen years old," Zeph said quietly. "She is barely older than me."

"Yes." Cornelius's tail curled against Zeph's collarbone. "Age does not prevent manipulation. Does not prevent being used by those we trust."

"Valerian is the real monster. Not her."

"Valerian is complicated." Cornelius adjusted his spectacles. "He was genuinely exploited by Lucchesi. Genuinely betrayed. His anger was justified. His desire for revenge was understandable."

"But he used her. Turned her into weapon. Let her commit murder for him."

"Yes." Cornelius was quiet for moment. "That is what makes him complicated rather than simply victim. He suffered genuine harm. Then inflicted worse harm on others. Both things are true simultaneously."

Captain Melas approached. His weathered face showed every hour of this investigation. Every impossible choice. Every political pressure.

"Your eighty-eight percent certainty was sufficient," he said.

"Eighty-nine percent by the end," Cornelius corrected. "The certainty increased when she accepted the tea."

"Still not one hundred percent."

"No. But closer than my previous ninety percent regarding Valerian." Cornelius's wings folded. "I am learning that higher numerical certainty does not guarantee accuracy. That complete confidence can be more dangerous than qualified probability."

"That is remarkably mature admission from library dragon who generally insists he is correct about everything." Captain Melas's expression held ghost of smile. "You are improving."

"I am adapting methodology based on catastrophic failure." Cornelius's tail swished. "That is not improvement. That is survival instinct."

"Call it what you wish. The result is the same." The Captain glanced at Zeph. "And you. The danger sense. The warning. You saved her life."

Zeph nodded. His hand moved to his temple where the headache was presumably still present. "I just felt it. The spike. The musical wrongness. I did not think. Just shouted."

"Thinking is overrated in crisis situations." Captain Melas made final notation in his book. "Instinct is often faster. More reliable. Your instinct was correct."

"My instinct is medical condition that gives me migraines and makes me smell like ozone." Zeph's voice held bitter edge. "Not exactly reliable."

"It warned you about poisoned water at the tribunal. Warned you about Chloe's suicide attempt tonight. That is two major saves in approximately four hours." The Captain's expression was serious. "I would classify that as remarkably reliable. Unusual. Undocumented. But reliable."

Zeph was quiet. Processing. His breathing had returned to normal rhythm. No longer using the four-count pattern. Just natural respiration.

Cornelius pressed closer against his neck. Silent support. Wordless acknowledgment that the boy had done well. Had contributed meaningfully. Had proven himself valuable beyond simple library assistance.

Had become actual partner.

"We should go," Cornelius said finally. "The investigation is concluded. Chloe is in custody. Valerian will wake with guards present. Captain Melas has control of the situation."

"Where will we go?" Zeph asked.

"To the Library." Cornelius adjusted his spectacles. "Where we belong. Where order exists. Where books wait to be catalogued and shelves require proper organization."

"It is half past two in the morning."

"Excellent time for archival work. Minimal interruption. Optimal quiet." Cornelius's tail curved in anticipation. "And I abandoned Lucchesi's signed first edition in the Mayor's office. That volume requires immediate retrieval and proper storage."

"Of course it does." Zeph's voice held exhausted affection. "Cannot possibly wait until morning."

"Morning is for amateurs and people who sleep regular hours." Cornelius hopped from Zeph's shoulder to his customary perch. "We are library professionals. We work when work requires working."

Captain Melas watched them prepare to leave. "The Mayor will require full report. Formal documentation. Probably public statement."

"Then you may tell her that Library Dragon Cornelius Drake and his intern successfully identified murderer through application of cultural anthropology and proper tea service." Cornelius's wings spread slightly. "That should satisfy civic pride and political necessity."

"That will satisfy neither. But it will have to suffice." The Captain's expression softened fractionally. "Thank you. Both of you. This could have ended considerably worse."

"Yes. It could have." Cornelius met his gaze steadily. "But it did not. And we learned valuable lessons about certainty versus probability. About culture versus force. About tea service as weapon."

"About two liabilities working together," Zeph added quietly.

"About that as well." Cornelius's tail swished in pleased rhythm. "Now. We retreat to our domain. We process tonight's events through proper cataloguing. We restore order to chaos. We—"

"We go home," Zeph finished.

"Yes." Cornelius settled deeper into his shoulder perch. "We go home."

They left the infirmary. Left Captain Melas to his documentation. Left the healer to monitor Valerian's approaching consciousness. Left the broken glass and dissolved carpet and the aftermath of murder solved through hospitality.

The corridor was quiet. Empty. Most witnesses had been released. The building felt hollowed out. Waiting for dawn. Waiting for normal civic function to resume.

Waiting for order to reassert itself after chaos.

Cornelius could work with that. Could facilitate that restoration. Could return to his books and his shelves and his comfortable library existence.

Could file this investigation in mental archives as completed case. As solved mystery. As the night library dragon became detective through necessity and tea service.

Eighty-nine percent certainty had been sufficient after all.

Not perfect. Not absolute. But sufficient to prevent further death. To catch murderer. To understand complicated truth about manipulation and protection and the terrible things people did while believing they were right.

Sufficient to learn that being correct was less important than being careful. That elegant theories could kill. That probability mattered more than precision.

Sufficient to adjust methodology for future investigations.

If there were future investigations.

Which Cornelius sincerely hoped there would not be.

Once was educational. Twice would be pattern. Pattern would suggest expectation. Expectation would interfere with proper archival duties.

He was library dragon. Not detective. Not investigator. Not solver of murders.

Just keeper of knowledge who occasionally applied that knowledge to preventing tragedy.

That was sufficient definition.

That would have to be sufficient.

# Chapter 19

# Chapter 19

The Rotunda smelled like wine and panic and something Zeph could only describe as the ghost of ozone fading into nothing.

His headache was gone. Actually gone. Not lurking in the background waiting to spike. Not building like pressure before a storm. Just... absent.

Zeph pressed his palm against his temple. Nothing. No musical wrongness. No electrical tension scraping against the inside of his skull. No warning that something terrible was about to happen.

Because the terrible thing had already happened. And been stopped. And now Chloe Karellas was in custody and Valerian was unconscious but alive and Judgment Salt was contained and everything was over.

Zeph's legs felt unsteady. The kind of shakiness that came after sustained crisis ended and the body finally remembered it was supposed to be exhausted.

He leaned against one of the massive stone pillars near the Rotunda's entrance. The marble was cool against his shoulder blades. Solid. Real. Not dissolving into chaos or transforming into another emergency.

Just stone doing what stone did. Existing quietly in a vertical city built from it.

Across the vast circular space, Cornelius perched on the edge of the platform where Lucchesi had died—what felt like days ago but was actually only about six hours. The dragon's bronze scales caught the lamplight. His spectacles were precisely aligned. His tail curled in the particular rhythm that meant he was preparing to deliver formal explanation.

The remaining gala guests had been gathered back into the Rotunda at Captain Melas's instruction. Not everyone. The servers and musicians had been released first. Then the minor civic officials. Then anyone without direct connection to the key players.

But the Tile Families remained. The important people. The ones who needed answers before the building could finally be unsealed and normal life could resume.

Mayor Barca stood near the platform with her arms crossed. Still wearing her ceremonial robes. Still projecting authority despite the exhaustion visible in her posture.

The Doukas family occupied chairs near the center. Master Eleni looked severe. Her husband sat beside her with the expression of someone enduring necessary political theater. And Sophia—

Sophia was watching Cornelius with the focused attention she usually reserved for particularly complicated mosaic patterns.

Zeph looked away. His chest felt tight but not painful. More like the awareness of something ending. Something that had maybe never really started properly in the first place.

"Ladies. Gentlemen. Distinguished guests." Cornelius's voice carried across the Rotunda with the authority of someone who had delivered approximately ten thousand library orientations. "Captain Melas has requested that I provide explanation of tonight's events. Specifically regarding the death of Fabrizio Lucchesi and the identification of his killer."

The room settled into attentive silence. Even the whispered conversations in the back rows stopped.

Cornelius adjusted his spectacles with one claw. "The facts are straightforward. Lucchesi was poisoned with rare alchemical compound called Judgment Salt. The poison was administered during his pre-speech medication routine. The killer was Chloe Karellas. She has confessed. She is currently in custody."

Giovanni Conti—still present despite his earlier release as non-suspect—leaned forward in his seat. "Why? What was her motive?"

"Protection." Cornelius's tail swished once. "Miss Karellas believed Fabrizio Lucchesi was having affair with her mother. Believed he was threatening her family. Believed eliminating him was necessary to preserve what she loved."

Murmurs rippled through the crowd. Several people glanced toward where Irene Karellas sat very still beside her husband Pavlos. Her face was carefully neutral. Professional. The expression of someone who had spent the last several hours being questioned about her personal life by law enforcement.

"However." Cornelius continued. His voice cut through the whispers. "This is where the situation becomes interesting. Judgment Salt is not conventional poison. It does not kill indiscriminately. It kills only those who are guilty."

Master Eleni's eyes narrowed. "Guilty of what?"

"That is the crucial question." Cornelius's wings spread slightly. "The compound responds to guilt. Specifically to the target's own belief in their guilt. To the crime they consider unforgivable in themselves. The poison becomes lethal only when the victim's conscience provides the necessary resonance."

Zeph watched the crowd process this information. Watched confusion shift into understanding. Watched the implications settle like dust after explosion.

"So Lucchesi died because he felt guilty?" Someone in the back rows asked. "Because he knew he was having the affair?"

"No." Cornelius's voice was firm. "Lucchesi died because he felt profoundly guilty about stealing another person's intellectual work. About exploiting vulnerable assistant. About taking credit for writing he did not produce."

The Rotunda went absolutely silent.

"Valerian." Giovanni's voice was quiet. "The ghostwriting. Everyone suspected but no one could prove."

"The Judgment Salt proved it." Cornelius adjusted his spectacles again. "The poison responded to Lucchesi's deepest guilt. His strongest self-condemnation. Which was not adultery—which he was not actually committing—but intellectual theft. Soul theft. The taking of another person's voice and identity."

Irene Karellas made small sound. Half laugh. Half sob. Her hands were folded tightly in her lap.

Cornelius glanced toward her with something almost gentle in his expression. "Miss Karellas poisoned the correct man. But for entirely wrong reason. She believed she was executing adulterer. Instead she executed plagiarist. The moral mathematics worked regardless. But the tragedy is that she did not understand what she had actually accomplished."

"And Valerian?" Mayor Barca's voice was carefully controlled. "Why did she try to kill him?"

"Because she believed he was secondary threat. Another of Irene's lovers. Another corruption endangering the family." Cornelius's tail curled. "But Valerian was the actual affair partner. Was the one with genuine romantic connection to Irene Karellas. Was the one who had manipulated Chloe into murdering his professional rival while making her believe she was protecting her family."

The whispers started again. Louder now. More agitated.

Zeph closed his eyes. The conversation washed over him like distant music. Important but somehow separate from where he stood. From what he was processing.

His headache was still gone. That fact felt more significant than any of the political maneuvering happening in the Rotunda's center. More real than the Tile Families' scandals or the Mayor's concern about public perception.

His danger sense had been screaming for hours. Musical wrongness and ozone smell and the terrible certainty that something catastrophic was approaching. And now it was just... quiet.

Like his brain had finally realized the crisis was over and had given him permission to stop vibrating with fear.

Zeph opened his eyes. Focused on Cornelius still holding court on the platform. The dragon was explaining the hospitality law. The tea service. The absurd but effective method of binding Chloe through cultural protocol rather than force.

Several people were smiling now. The tension breaking into something almost like appreciation. The library dragon had stopped murder with beverage service. It was the kind of story people would retell. Would embellish. Would turn into legend.

Cornelius was loving it. Zeph could tell from the precise angle of his wings. From the slightly elevated tone. The dragon would complain later about being center of attention. Would insist he preferred quiet archival work.

But right now he was performing. And enjoying himself.

Zeph felt his mouth curve into half-smile. Two liabilities working together. Learning from catastrophic mistakes. Stopping killers with tea trays and ancient law.

It was ridiculous. It was improbable. It had somehow worked.

Movement in his peripheral vision. Someone approaching from the direction of the Doukas family's chairs.

Sophia. Walking toward him with careful precision. Still wearing her gala dress. Still perfectly composed despite everything that had happened.

Zeph straightened away from the pillar. His stomach did something complicated. Not the danger sense. Just normal human anxiety about difficult conversation.

"Hey," he said quietly.

"Hey." Sophia stopped a few feet away. Close enough for private conversation but not close enough to touch. "Can we talk?"

"Yeah. Sure." Zeph glanced toward where Cornelius was now fielding questions from Giovanni about the specific properties of Judgment Salt. "Looks like this might take a while anyway."

They moved further from the crowd. Found relatively private space near one of the side corridors. The same corridors where servers had rushed earlier carrying wine. Where Zeph had hidden during his worst headache episodes.

The stone floor was still marked with faint wine stains from Lucchesi's death. Someone had cleaned most of it. But the marble remembered. Would probably remember for decades.

Sophia folded her arms. Not defensive exactly. More like holding herself together. "I wanted to say something."

"Okay."

"You saved her life. Chloe. When she tried to drink the poison." Sophia's voice was steady but quiet. "Theo told my mother. Said you grabbed her arm. Stopped her before she could finish it."

"Cornelius knocked the vial. I just caught her when she fell." Zeph shoved his hands into his pockets. "Was not exactly heroic."

"You were there. You acted. You prevented someone from dying." Sophia's expression softened. "That matters. That is—" She stopped. Drew breath. "You were incredible tonight. In the infirmary. During the investigation. All of it."

Zeph felt heat creep up his neck. "I mostly just stood around having headaches and trying not to throw up."

"You warned Valerian about the poisoned water. Cornelius said your danger sense saved him."

"Yeah. Well. The danger sense also made me run away from your family three separate times. Made me look like unreliable flake who could not handle basic social interaction." Zeph's voice was dry. "So. Mixed results."

Sophia stepped closer. "I was wrong. Earlier. In the hallway. I said you always had something wrong when things mattered. But watching you tonight. Seeing you work. Actually paying attention instead of just being embarrassed—" She reached toward him. Not quite touching. "The headaches were real. The sensitivity was real. And you kept going anyway. You helped solve murder despite being in pain. That is not weakness. That is strength."

Zeph looked at her extended hand. At the carefully painted nails and the delicate silver bracelet she had worn to the gala. At the girl who had invited him here. Who had tried to make space for him in her world.

"Your mother still thinks I am disaster," he said quietly.

"My mother thinks many things." Sophia's hand dropped slightly but did not withdraw. "Her opinion is not the only one that matters."

"She is Tile Family matriarch. Her opinion is literally the only one that matters in your house."

"Not to me." Sophia's voice had edge now. The same determination she showed when defending artistic choice. "I choose who I spend time with. Who I care about. Not her."

Zeph felt something crack open in his chest. Not painful. More like release. Like pressure finally equalizing.

"Sophia." He said her name gently. "You are amazing. You know that right? You are brilliant and talented and you tried really hard to make this work."

Her expression shifted. Understanding starting to dawn. "But."

"But I do not fit here." Zeph gestured vaguely toward the Rotunda. Toward the glittering crowd and the marble floors and the careful political theater. "This is your world. The galas and the family connections and the social navigation. You are good at it. You belong here."

"You could learn. You could—"

"I could try." Zeph's voice was firmer now. "I could keep trying. Keep forcing myself into spaces that make the danger sense scream. Keep failing at family introductions. Keep being liability your parents have to explain."

"You are not liability."

"I am though." The word did not sting the way it had earlier. Just felt true. Accurate. "Not in bad way. Just in practical way. I am library intern who has migraines near danger and solves murders with dragons and eats noodles standing over the sink. That is who I am. And trying to be something else—trying to be someone who belongs at Tile Family galas—that was never going to work."

Sophia's hand fell completely. Her arms crossed again. Tighter this time. "So that is it? You are giving up?"

"I am choosing something different." Zeph met her eyes. "I had good time tonight. Terrible time. But also good. Figured out something important. Did something that mattered. Helped stop killer. That felt right. Felt like where I am supposed to be."

"In murder investigations?"

"In the library. With Cornelius. Doing the work I am actually good at." Zeph's voice gentled. "You were right earlier. About me not being able to function in the spaces you need me to function in. That was accurate assessment. And I could spend years trying to fix that. Trying to become person who can. Or I could just. Be myself. In the place where being myself is actually useful."

Sophia was quiet for long moment. Her expression was complicated. Hurt and understanding and frustration all mixed together.

"I really liked you," she said finally.

"I really liked you too." Zeph smiled. Small but genuine. "Still do. Just. As friends maybe? Without the pressure of trying to make our lives fit together when they are shaped completely differently?"

"Friends." Sophia tested the word. "That feels sad."

"Little bit yeah." Zeph pulled his hands from his pockets. "But also honest. And probably better than me continuing to panic-flee from your mother indefinitely."

That got half-laugh. Brief but real. Some of the tension broke.

"You did panic-flee a lot," Sophia admitted.

"So much fleeing. Truly impressive amounts." Zeph's voice was dry. "Should probably be documented for future research into how not to handle relationship pressure."

"Future researchers will be amazed."

"Baffled. Concerned for my wellbeing."

Sophia's smile faded but did not disappear entirely. "I am going to miss this. The talking. The jokes."

"We can still talk. Still joke. Just without the added stress of me trying to perform for your family's approval." Zeph shifted his weight. "Maybe that will be better. Easier. Less disaster-prone."

"Maybe." Sophia glanced back toward where her parents sat in the Rotunda proper. "I should return. Before my mother decides I am being compromised by association with investigation."

"Probably wise."

She turned to go. Then stopped. Looked back at him. "For what it is worth. I think the library is lucky to have you."

"Thanks." Zeph's throat felt tight. "Your mosaics are going to be incredible. Whatever you make next."

"They will be." She smiled properly now. Confident. "I will make certain you see them. Even if you are hiding in the library avoiding social interaction."

"I will be hiding so effectively. You will need search party."

"I will bring Cornelius. He seems effective at finding people who do not wish to be found."

"Terrifyingly effective." Zeph agreed.

Sophia hesitated one more moment. Then closed the distance. Hugged him quickly. Brief contact. Arms around shoulders. Then pulling back before he could properly respond.

"Be safe, Zeph."

"You too."

She walked back toward her family. Her posture was straight. Composed. The same grace she had shown all night despite the chaos and the murder and the emotional turbulence.

Zeph watched her go. Felt the strange combination of relief and loss settle in his chest.

That was done then. The relationship that had maybe never quite worked. The attempt to bridge two very different worlds. The pressure of trying to be someone he was not.

Done. Finished. Released.

His headache was still gone. That felt significant. Felt like confirmation that he had made right choice.

Across the Rotunda, Cornelius was wrapping up his explanation. The crowd was dispersing slightly. Captain Melas was giving final instructions about when people could leave. When building would be unsealed. When normal civic function would resume.

Zeph pushed away from the wall. Walked back toward where Cornelius held court.

The dragon spotted him approaching. His tail did pleased swish. "Ah. There you are. We are nearly finished with political necessities. Then we can retreat to the library where proper silence and organization exist."

"Sounds good." Zeph stopped beside the platform. "Ready when you are."

"I am perpetually ready to leave civic buildings." Cornelius hopped down from the platform. Landed lightly near Zeph's feet. "They smell of politics and compromise. Deeply unpleasant."

"Yeah. Not great." Zeph offered his arm. Cornelius climbed up. Settled onto his customary shoulder perch. The familiar weight was grounding. Comfortable.

"Was that Miss Doukas you were speaking with?" Cornelius asked quietly.

"Yeah."

"Everything resolved satisfactorily?"

"Yeah. We are friends now. No more relationship pressure. No more trying to fit into worlds that do not actually fit."

Cornelius was quiet for moment. His claws adjusted grip slightly on Zeph's shoulder. "That was mature decision."

"Thanks."

"Also probably correct decision."

"Probably."

"You belong in the library." Cornelius's voice held certainty. "With books and organization and proper archival practice. Not at galas performing for social approval."

"Yeah." Zeph felt smile tug at his mouth. "That is what I figured."

They moved toward the exit. Toward the corridor that would lead them out of City Hall. Away from the marble and the politics and the Tile Families' carefully constructed world.

Captain Melas intercepted them near the door. "You are leaving?"

"Investigation is concluded. Statements are given. We have fulfilled civic obligation." Cornelius adjusted his spectacles. "Now we return to our actual responsibilities. The library will have accumulated considerable administrative backlog during our absence."

"The library will survive few more hours." Captain Melas's expression was tired but almost fond. "But I understand the retreat impulse. Too many people. Too much noise. Too much..." He gestured vaguely at the Rotunda.

"Politics," Cornelius supplied.

"Politics," the Captain agreed. "Thank you. Both of you. This could have ended considerably worse."

"Yes. Could have ended with collapsed building and multiple additional deaths and complete chaos." Cornelius's tail swished. "Instead it ended with solved murder and contained scandal and only moderate chaos. Definite improvement."

"I will include that assessment in my official report." Captain Melas offered something almost like smile. "Mayor will be thrilled."

"The Mayor is politician. Thrilled is not her natural state. Merely varying degrees of concerned about public perception."

"Accurate." The Captain stepped aside. Cleared path to the exit. "Go. Rest. Process. Return to your comfortable library existence. You have both earned retreat."

Zeph nodded. Felt the weight of exhaustion settling deeper now that permission had been given. Now that crisis was truly over and rest was actually option.

They walked down the corridor. Past the records storage where they had researched earlier. Past the service rooms where they had found the tea tray. Past all the spaces where the investigation had unfolded.

The building was quiet now. Most people gone. Just the skeleton crew of guards remaining. Just the essential personnel cleaning up the aftermath.

Cool night air hit them as they stepped outside. Not cold exactly. Just fresher. Less heavy than the recycled atmosphere of constantly occupied building.

The street was empty. All the festival decorations from earlier still hung between buildings. The lanterns had been extinguished. The celebration canceled. The gala that should have been triumph for Lucchesi had become his crime scene instead.

Zeph pulled his jacket tighter. The formal coat he had worn to impress Sophia's family. That felt like months ago instead of just tonight.

"Your headache has ceased," Cornelius observed.

"Yeah. Completely gone."

"Guardian sense operates through proximity to danger. With Chloe contained and Valerian guarded and crisis resolved, the sense would naturally subside." Cornelius's claws flexed slightly. Thinking rhythm. "But the absence must feel significant regardless."

"Yeah. It does." Zeph started walking toward the library. Toward home. "Feels like I can actually breathe properly now. Like someone turned off the alarm that was constantly screaming in my brain."

"Accurate metaphor." Cornelius settled deeper onto his perch. "Guardian abilities are protective mechanism. But protection requires constant vigilance. Constant awareness of threat. When threat is removed, the vigilance can finally rest."

"Is it always going to be like this? The headaches and the danger sense and the musical wrongness?"

"Unknown." Cornelius was quiet for moment. "But we can research. Can document. Can understand what you are experiencing and develop better management strategies. That is what libraries do. Provide knowledge. Create understanding from chaos."

Zeph felt something ease in his chest. "Yeah. Okay. We can do that."

They walked in comfortable silence. Through streets Zeph knew well. Past the noodle shop where he ate most meals. Past the supply store that sold book-repair equipment. Past all the familiar landmarks of life that worked. Life that fit.

The library appeared ahead. Its building was older than the newer gala district. Made from different colored stone. Warmer somehow. More worn.

Less glittering. More real.

Home.

Zeph climbed the steps. Pushed through the door. The smell of old paper and dust and knowledge wrapped around him like blanket.

Imelda looked up from the reference desk. Her silver-white hair caught the lamplight. She had beaten them back. Was already processing returned books.

"Investigation complete?" she asked.

"Complete," Cornelius confirmed. "Killer in custody. Victim identified. Justice served. Politics managed. We are officially done with civic obligations and can return to proper archival responsibilities."

"Excellent." Imelda's smile was gentle. "I have prepared tea in your study. And the cart of returned volumes needs cataloging. Thought you might appreciate familiar work after..." She gestured vaguely toward the direction of City Hall.

"After chaos and murder and bureaucratic inefficiency." Cornelius hopped down from Zeph's shoulder. Began walking toward his workspace. "Yes. Familiar work is exactly what is needed. Order. Organization. Proper decimal classification."

Zeph followed. Found himself smiling. Not forced. Not performing. Just genuine quiet amusement at the dragon's priorities.

Two liabilities working together. Solving murders. Stopping chaos. Returning to books.

It was strange life. Ridiculous life. But it was his life. And standing in the library with Cornelius already complaining about filing system inconsistencies and Imelda humming while she worked—

This felt right. Felt like belonging.

Felt like where he was supposed to be.

His headache was gone. The danger had passed. The case was solved.

And tomorrow there would be books to catalog. Puzzles to solve. Quiet work in comfortable space.

That was enough. That was everything.

Zeph pulled off his formal jacket. Hung it carefully on the hook. Picked up the first book from the return cart.

Ready to go back to work.

# Chapter 20

# Chapter 20

The inscription was perfect.

Cornelius adjusted his spectacles with one claw and examined the handwriting again. Neat. Precise. The kind of penmanship that came from years of careful documentation. From understanding that words mattered. That attribution mattered. That getting the record correct was not vanity but fundamental necessity.

*To Cornelius Drake, Library Dragon and Keeper of Truth. May you always know the difference between knowledge and lies. With profound gratitude for your pursuit of accuracy. —Valerian*

The ink was fresh enough that Cornelius could still detect the faint chemical signature of iron gall. Applied sometime in the early hours of this morning. After Valerian had regained consciousness. After Captain Melas had informed him of his legal status. After the Sphinx had processed the entire catastrophic sequence of manipulation and murder and consequence.

And then—presumably while still under guard in the City Hall infirmary—Valerian had requested writing materials. Had asked that someone retrieve the signed first edition from the Mayor's office. Had carefully inscribed this dedication on the title page opposite Lucchesi's earlier flourish.

Cornelius traced one claw along the edge of the page. The paper was still perfect. Still the same rare quality that had made this volume valuable in the first place. Still containing Lucchesi's fraudulent inscription praising "knowledge as foundation of truth."

But now it also contained the truth about who had actually written the theories. Who had actually discovered the mathematical foundations. Who had been exploited for another man's glory.

The record was corrected. The knowledge was attributed properly. Order was restored to this small corner of the universe.

Cornelius felt his wings settle into their most relaxed position. His tail stopped its thinking-rhythm and simply curled around the base of his reading stand. The tension that had resided between his shoulder blades since the gala—since discovering Lucchesi's body—since realizing he had been catastrophically wrong about Valerian—finally released.

This was sufficient. This was correct. This was what library dragons existed to accomplish.

He picked up another cricket from the silver bowl positioned precisely three inches from his right foreclaw. Premium quality. Imported from the specialty breeder who understood that dragons required optimal nutrition. Perfectly roasted with just enough sea salt to enhance flavor without overwhelming the natural sweetness.

The cricket was satisfyingly crunchy. The compound eyes provided excellent textural contrast. The legs had that pleasant fragility that indicated proper moisture content.

Cornelius consumed it with deliberate appreciation. Then returned his attention to the book.

The library was quiet around him. Properly quiet. The kind of silence that came from well-organized spaces where everything resided in its designated location. Where the air itself seemed to settle into comfortable patterns. Where disorder had been banished and rightness prevailed.

His private study occupied the upper level of the east wing. Away from the public reading rooms. Away from the reference desk where Imelda managed the constant flow of patrons. Away from the circulation area where returned volumes accumulated in untidy piles before being properly reshelved.

Here there was only stone and wood and books. Only the precise organization of knowledge. Only the comfortable weight of systems functioning as intended.

Cornelius had positioned his reading stand near the narrow window that overlooked the interior courtyard. The view showed nothing but other library buildings. Other wings dedicated to different classifications. Other repositories of accumulated wisdom.

No politics. No civic maneuvering. No Tile Families performing elaborate social theater.

Just books. Just order. Just the peaceful predictability of proper archival practice.

He selected another cricket. This one had been roasted with a hint of rosemary. The herb added pleasant aromatic complexity without disrupting the fundamental cricket-ness of the experience.

Footsteps approached from the corridor. Cornelius recognized the pattern without needing to look up. Measured pace. Slight whisper of traditional robes against stone floor. The faint percussion of copper beads clicking in braided hair.

Imelda appeared in the doorway. She was carrying two items: a steaming cup that smelled of mint and honey, and a folded piece of official-looking parchment sealed with the Mayor's mark.

"I thought you might appreciate refreshment," she said. Setting the cup on the small table beside his reading stand. At exactly the optimal distance for reaching without needing to move from his current position.

Excellent woman. Understood proper beverage placement instinctively.

"Thank you." Cornelius did not look up from the book. "The mint is particularly appropriate given the circumstances."

"I assumed you would be processing." Imelda settled into one of the reading chairs. The furniture was scaled for human proportions but she had never seemed bothered by the fact that Cornelius preferred his elevated reading stand. "Valerian's inscription is well-executed."

"It is adequate." Cornelius turned the page with careful precision. "The sentiment is unnecessarily effusive. But the penmanship is acceptable and the attribution is correct. That is sufficient."

"Merely adequate and acceptable. High praise indeed." The amusement in Imelda's voice was gentle. Familiar. The tone of someone who had worked alongside Cornelius for forty-three years and understood his particular relationship with compliments.

Cornelius's tail swished once. "The important element is the correction of historical record. Future researchers consulting this volume will now understand the true authorship of the theoretical framework. Will see both inscriptions. Will be able to construct accurate timeline of exploitation and eventual revelation."

"You turned a murder investigation into archival documentation project."

"I turned chaos into order. That is what library dragons do." Cornelius selected another cricket. "The documentation is merely proper follow-through."

Imelda was quiet for a moment. Her fingers traced the edge of the sealed parchment. "The Mayor has sent correspondence."

"Of course she has. Politicians cannot resist generating paperwork." Cornelius consumed the cricket. "What does she want? Formal statement? Public commendation? Theatrical award ceremony involving excessive speeches?"

"Fine assessment." Imelda held up the parchment. "For damages to City Hall property during the investigation."

Cornelius's head snapped up. His spectacles caught the lamplight. His wings spread halfway in outraged incredulity. "She is charging the Library for damages?"

"Specifically charging you. For the dissolved carpet where the Judgment Salt spilled. For the shattered vial. For the tea service that was not returned to proper storage." Imelda's expression remained absolutely neutral. "The amount is quite specific. Down to the copper."

"That carpet was already stained from Lucchesi's death. The vial was broken while preventing suicide. The tea service was instrumental in binding dangerous criminal through cultural protocol." Cornelius's tail lashed. "We provided essential civic service. We solved murder. We prevented additional deaths. And the Mayor responds with invoice?"

"Politics." Imelda set the parchment on the table beside the teacup. "She needs to demonstrate fiscal responsibility to the Tile Families. Needs to show that even dragons are subject to civic cost recovery. It is performance. Not actual expectation of payment."

"Then why send the invoice at all?"

"Because she is politician. Creating paper trail is instinctive for her species." Imelda's smile was subtle. "I suggest we file it in the 'Civic Correspondence - Performative' section and forget it exists."

Cornelius considered this. His wings folded back into proper position. His tail stopped its agitated swishing. "That is acceptable solution. The filing will create order from bureaucratic nonsense. Order is its own reward."

"Indeed." Imelda stood. Smoothed her robes. "I will leave you to your reading. Zeph should arrive soon. He sent message earlier indicating he slept until noon but is now ready to resume duties."

"Good. The returns cart is overflowing. Proper shelving cannot wait indefinitely just because we spent the night preventing murders." Cornelius returned his attention to the book. "Send him up when he arrives. We have considerable backlog to process."

"Of course." Imelda paused in the doorway. "You did well. Both of you. The investigation. The resolution. The prevention of additional tragedy. It was well done."

Cornelius's claws flexed against the reading stand. "We made catastrophic errors. I was ninety percent certain about Valerian and completely wrong. We nearly enabled innocent man to be executed for murder he did not commit."

"But you corrected. You adjusted. You learned." Imelda's voice was firm. "That is what matters. Not the perfect certainty. But the willingness to revise when presented with better information."

"Revision is humiliating."

"Revision is survival. Particularly for beings who accumulate knowledge." She tapped the doorframe once. "Scholars who cannot revise become fossils. You are many things, Cornelius. But you are not fossil."

She departed before he could formulate response. Left him alone with the book and the crickets and the uncomfortable accuracy of her observation.

Cornelius stared at the page without reading it. His mind was turning over the sequence of the investigation. The initial certainty that had felt so solid. The elegant theory that had collapsed under scrutiny. The terrible moment when Valerian had drunk the poisoned water and Cornelius had realized his mistake.

Ninety percent certain. High enough probability to justify confident public accusation. High enough to feel righteous. High enough to be catastrophically wrong.

But then—eighty-nine percent certain about Chloe. Lower numerical value. Less confident. More cautious. And correct.

The difference was humility. Was the willingness to say "I am not absolutely certain" instead of "I am correct therefore this must be true."

Was the understanding that logic was tool. Not truth itself. Just instrument for approaching truth.

Cornelius's tail curled tighter. That was uncomfortable revelation. Uncomfortable adjustment to worldview. Uncomfortable acknowledgment that being brilliant was insufficient if brilliance was not tempered with caution.

He selected another cricket. Consumed it with perhaps more aggression than the situation warranted. The crunch was satisfying. The salt was sharp on his tongue.

Outside his study, the library continued its quiet function. Patrons moving through stacks. Scholars consulting references. The endless cycle of knowledge being accessed and returned and accessed again.

The world had not ended because Cornelius had been wrong. The investigation had been corrected. The true culprit had been identified. Justice—complicated and imperfect as it was—had been served.

And he had learned. Had adjusted methodology. Had lowered his threshold for acceptable certainty. Had added caution to his analytical process.

That was sufficient. That was growth. That was what Imelda had meant about not becoming fossil.

Still uncomfortable though. Still required ongoing processing. Still meant confronting the reality that being Library Dragon did not automatically confer infallibility.

Footsteps on the stairs. Different pattern from Imelda's measured pace. Faster. Slightly irregular rhythm. The particular gait of someone who was perpetually about three inches taller than they were used to being and had not quite adjusted their spatial awareness to compensate.

Zeph appeared in the doorway. His hair was in its usual state of barely-controlled chaos. His shirt was wrinkled in specific pattern that indicated he had fallen asleep wearing it and then put it back on without bothering to find fresh clothing. His eyes showed the slightly reddened quality that came from sleeping too long after sustained crisis.

But his expression was lighter than it had been at the gala. The tension that had resided in his shoulders—the constant bracing for social disaster—was absent. He looked tired. Rumpled. Decidedly unpresentable.

He looked right.

"Hey," Zeph said. Leaning against the doorframe. "Imelda said you wanted help with the returns."

"The returns cart has been accumulating for two days. Proper organization cannot be indefinitely postponed." Cornelius gestured with one wing toward the corridor. "The cart is outside the fiction section. Standard classification. Return everything to appropriate shelf position arranged by author surname and publication date."

"Yeah. I know how shelving works." Zeph pushed away from the doorframe. Then stopped. Noticed the book on Cornelius's reading stand. "Is that the first edition?"

"Yes."

"Can I see it?"

Cornelius hesitated. The book was valuable. Rare. The kind of volume that should be handled only with proper conservation training and appropriate reverence. Zeph had neither.

But Zeph had also saved Valerian's life. Had grabbed Chloe's arm when she tried to drink Judgment Salt. Had been partner throughout the investigation despite constant physical discomfort and social pressure.

Had earned right to see the corrected record.

"You may look. Not touch." Cornelius rotated the reading stand slightly. Allowed Zeph to see the page with both inscriptions. "Observe the contrast. Lucchesi's inscription is performative. Elaborate calligraphy designed to impress. Valerian's is simple. Direct. Focused on accuracy rather than display."

Zeph leaned closer. Read both inscriptions silently. His expression shifted. Not dramatic change. Just subtle softening around his eyes. Recognition of significance.

"He called you Keeper of Truth."

"Valerian is prone to dramatic phrasing." Cornelius's tail swished once. "Though the sentiment is not entirely inaccurate."

"You got the book signed by the actual author. The one who actually wrote the theories." Zeph straightened. "That is what you wanted from the beginning. Just took murder investigation and near-death experiences to accomplish it."

"The path was unnecessarily complicated. But the result is correct." Cornelius rotated the reading stand back to his preferred angle. "That is sufficient."

Zeph was quiet for moment. His hand moved toward the book. Then stopped. Remembered the no-touching instruction. "I am glad you got what you wanted. Even if the process was insane."

"Insanity is subjective classification." Cornelius selected another cricket from the bowl. "From certain perspectives, our actions were entirely logical. From others, we appeared to be reckless amateurs interfering with professional investigation."

"We were definitely reckless amateurs."

"We were liabilities working together." Cornelius consumed the cricket. "And we prevented additional tragedy. That transforms liability into asset through contextual reframing."

"Pretty sure Captain Melas still considers us liabilities."

"Captain Melas is exhausted civil servant managing impossible political pressures while trying to maintain basic civic order. His opinion is shaped by pragmatic necessity rather than objective assessment." Cornelius's wings settled. "But yes. He probably still considers us liabilities. Useful liabilities. But liabilities nonetheless."

Zeph smiled. Small expression. Tired but genuine. "I can live with that classification."

"Good. Because it is accurate." Cornelius gestured toward the corridor again. "Now. The returns require shelving. Standing here discussing our liability status is not productive use of time."

"Yeah. Okay. I am going." Zeph pushed away from the doorframe. Started toward the stairs. Then stopped. Turned back. "Are you going to stay up here reading all day?"

"I am processing. Processing requires solitude and optimal cricket consumption." Cornelius adjusted his spectacles. "I will emerge when the processing is complete and civic bureaucracy has been forgotten."

"That is not how processing works. You are just hiding."

"I am strategically withdrawing to restore internal equilibrium."

"You are hiding in your study eating fancy crickets and reading your book." Zeph's voice held familiar dry amusement. "Which is fine. You earned the hiding. Just admit that is what you are doing."

Cornelius's tail lashed once. "Fine. I am hiding. Satisfied?"

"Yeah. Actually." Zeph's smile widened slightly. "I will be downstairs hiding in the fiction stacks pretending to shelve books while actually reading them. We can both hide and call it work."

"That is completely different. You will actually be in proximity to books that require shelving. The hiding is merely incidental to the task."

"Sure. Whatever helps you process." Zeph disappeared down the stairs. His footsteps faded toward the lower levels.

Cornelius returned his attention to the book. To the two inscriptions. To the corrected record and the comfortable weight of accuracy properly documented.

The library was quiet again. Safe again. Ordered again.

Everything was returning to its proper configuration. The episodic invariant reasserting itself. The world resuming its predictable patterns.

Cornelius consumed another cricket. This one was particularly well-balanced. Good crunch-to-salt ratio. Optimal roasting. The kind of quality that justified premium pricing.

He had been eating from this bowl for approximately forty minutes. Had consumed perhaps a third of the available crickets. Had been selfishly hoarding the premium quality for his own exclusive consumption while Zeph worked downstairs managing the returns cart.

That was normal behavior. Expected behavior. Dragons did not share food. Did not distribute resources from personal hoard. Did not engage in communal consumption practices.

Except.

Cornelius's gaze drifted toward the corridor. Toward the stairs where Zeph had disappeared. Toward the lower levels where his intern—partner—liability-companion was currently shelving books and pretending not to read them.

The boy had not eaten proper meal since yesterday afternoon. Had survived the gala on nervous energy and willpower. Had spent the entire night managing danger-sense headaches and preventing deaths. Had then slept until noon and immediately returned to work without stopping for food.

That was poor resource management. Insufficient fuel intake. The kind of oversight that would lead to decreased performance and eventual collapse.

Cornelius should point this out. Should remind Zeph that proper nutrition was essential for sustained productivity. Should lecture about the importance of regular meals and adequate protein consumption.

Should definitely not share his premium crickets.

Certainly should not offer food from his personal hoard.

That would be completely unprecedented. Entirely outside normal behavioral parameters. The kind of gesture that implied significance. That suggested Zeph was not merely valued employee but something closer to—

Cornelius's thoughts stuttered. Refused to complete that sentence. Veered sharply toward different topic.

The crickets were premium quality. Expensive. Specifically sourced. Part of his carefully curated supplies.

Sharing them would mean something.

Would mean acknowledgment. Would mean Zeph had transitioned from temporary assistant to permanent fixture. From convenient helper to actual companion. From library intern to—

To part of Cornelius's world. Part of his carefully organized existence. Part of what made the library feel right.

Cornelius's claws flexed against the reading stand. His tail curled tighter. His wings shifted in rhythm that indicated internal processing of uncomfortable emotional data.

This was ridiculous. They were just crickets. Just food. Just roasted insects that happened to be high quality.

Offering them was merely practical. Merely ensuring that his partner maintained adequate nutrition. Merely preventing future productivity loss due to insufficient protein.

Nothing emotional about it. Nothing significant. Just logical resource distribution.

Cornelius picked up the silver bowl. The crickets shifted with pleasant rustling sound. The scent of rosemary and salt and proper roasting filled his immediate environment.

His hoard. His carefully selected premium supplies. His private indulgence.

He looked at the bowl for long moment. Considered the implications. Weighed the significance of the gesture he was about to make.

Then he carried the bowl down the stairs.

The fiction section occupied the central area of the main floor. Alphabetically arranged by author surname with strict adherence to classification standards. The shelves were dark wood. Well-maintained. The kind of furniture that had existed in this library for centuries and would continue existing for centuries more.

Zeph was approximately halfway down the third row. The returns cart was positioned at the row's entrance. He had a book in one hand and was clearly reading instead of shelving.

Cornelius landed on top of the nearest shelf. Folded his wings. Arranged himself in position of dignified observation.

"That book belongs three shelves to your left," he said. "You are reading it instead of returning it to proper position."

Zeph jumped slightly. The book wobbled in his grip. He caught it before it fell. "I was just checking the condition. Making sure the binding was intact."

"You were reading the first chapter."

"I was checking if the first chapter was intact."

"The entire book is intact. It is seventy-three years old and has been properly maintained. Nothing requires checking." Cornelius's tail swished. "You are procrastinating through literary consumption."

"Yeah. Probably." Zeph shelved the book in its correct position. Reached for the next volume on the cart. "But the shelving is still getting done. Just slowly."

"Inefficiently."

"Slowly and inefficiently." Zeph's voice held the familiar dry amusement that meant he was comfortable. Relaxed. In his proper environment doing work that fit his particular organizational instincts.

Cornelius watched him work for moment. Observed the careful way he handled each volume. The automatic checking of spine condition. The precise placement ensuring proper alphabetical sequence. The small adjustments when books did not align perfectly.

The boy was good at this. Naturally skilled. The kind of intuitive organization sense that could not be taught. Only recognized and cultivated.

Library material. Not Tile Family politician. Not gala attendee. Not someone who belonged in marble halls performing elaborate social theater.

Someone who belonged here. In quiet spaces organized by logic. In environments where order mattered more than appearance. In the library.

"I brought something," Cornelius said.

Zeph paused mid-reach. Looked up toward the shelf where Cornelius perched. Noticed the silver bowl. His eyebrows rose. "Are those your fancy crickets?"

"They are premium quality crickets sourced from specialty breeder who understands proper roasting technique." Cornelius's tail curled around the bowl's base. "And you have not eaten proper meal today. Insufficient nutrition leads to decreased performance. Therefore sharing food is logical resource management decision."

"You are sharing your private stash of expensive crickets."

"I am preventing future productivity loss through strategic protein distribution."

"Right. Strategic." Zeph's expression shifted. Something uncertain. Almost vulnerable. "You do not have to do that. I can grab food later. You do not need to share."

"You will forget to eat. You always forget to eat when focused on tasks." Cornelius adjusted the bowl's position. "And these are optimal nutrition. High protein density. Excellent mineral content. Superior to whatever random street food you would eventually consume."

"They are crickets."

"They are premium crickets."

Zeph was quiet for moment. His hand still rested on the spine of the unshelved book. His expression was complicated. Processing implications. Understanding significance.

"This is weird," he said finally. "You sharing food. That is weird for you."

"It is unprecedented," Cornelius admitted. "But circumstances are unprecedented. We are liabilities who solved murder together. Who prevented additional deaths. Who corrected historical record and restored order to chaos. That creates different operational parameters."

"Different operational parameters." Zeph's mouth curved into small smile. "That is what you are calling it."

"That is accurate classification."

"Sure. Okay." Zeph shelved the book he was holding. Wiped his hands on his wrinkled shirt. Approached the shelf where Cornelius perched. "If you are certain about this."

"I am approximately eighty-nine percent certain. Which recent experience suggests is sufficient probability for correct decisions." Cornelius pushed the bowl toward the edge of the shelf. Within Zeph's reach. "Have a snack, boy."

Zeph reached up. Selected one cricket from the bowl. Examined it with the same careful attention he gave to book conditions. "These really are fancy. Look at the roasting."

"Premium quality. As stated." Cornelius settled into comfortable position. Wings folded. Tail curled. Spectacles aligned. "Consume it properly. Do not simply swallow. The flavor profile deserves appreciation."

Zeph consumed the cricket. His expression shifted through surprise into genuine appreciation. "Okay. That is actually really good. The rosemary is perfect."

"Obviously. I do not purchase inferior ingredients." Cornelius's tail swished once. Pleased rhythm. "You may have more. The bowl contains sufficient quantity for shared consumption."

Zeph selected another cricket. Consumed it with slightly more attention to the experience. "Thank you. For sharing. I know this is—" He gestured vaguely. "I know it means something. That you are doing this."

"It means I am preventing malnutrition in valuable library employee." Cornelius adjusted his spectacles. "Nothing more complex than practical resource management."

"Right. Resource management." Zeph's smile was soft. Understanding. The expression of someone who recognized truth beneath performed indifference. "I will remember that classification."

They remained there for quiet moment. Dragon perched on shelf with silver bowl. Human standing below with hands that smelled of old paper and rosemary crickets. The library continuing its peaceful function around them.

Everything was returning to its proper configuration. The chaos was processed. The crisis was resolved. The order was restored.

But something had shifted. Something had changed in the fundamental pattern. In the relationship between library dragon and intern. In the definition of what constituted normal operational parameters.

Cornelius would need to document that eventually. Would need to update his internal classification system. Would need to acknowledge that Zeph had transitioned from temporary assistant to permanent fixture in his carefully organized world.

But not now. Now there were crickets to share. Books to shelve. Quiet work to accomplish in comfortable silence.

Now there was order. Restored and elevated. The episodic invariant reasserting itself with new understanding woven through.

The library was safe. The knowledge was preserved. The record was corrected.

And Cornelius was content.

That was sufficient. That was everything. That was exactly correct.
