# Chapter 17

Cornelius pressed himself against the stone threshold of the recessed doorway. The position was not dignified. Dragons were not designed for lurking in shadows like common alley cats. But dignity was considerably less important than effective observation.

The infirmary doors stood open. Adequate sight line. He could see Chloe's back as she moved toward the cot where Valerian lay unconscious. Could see Captain Melas positioned near the entrance with both guards flanking. Could see the healer rising from their chair with cautious professional courtesy.

Could not see Chloe's hands.

The angle was wrong. Her body blocked the precise view Cornelius needed to identify substances or detect poison preparation. He had forensic vision. Could analyze compound composition. Could determine age of materials and chemical properties through focused observation.

But only if he could actually see what he was meant to analyze.

Cornelius adjusted his position. Shifted his weight forward. The stone was cold beneath his claws. Uncomfortable. He ignored the physical irritation and concentrated on visual access.

Chloe reached the bedside. The healer stepped back slightly. Giving space. Respecting grief. The young Siren's shoulders trembled. She pressed one webbed hand to her mouth.

"I am so sorry," she whispered.

The words were barely audible. But Cornelius was library dragon. His hearing had evolved for detecting the rustle of turning pages from three floors away. For identifying footsteps in distant corridors. For cataloguing every sound in his archival domain.

Human whispers at fifteen feet were entirely within normal perceptual range.

"I am so sorry," Chloe said again. Her voice broke. "I never wanted this. Never wanted you to—"

She stopped. Drew breath. Cornelius watched her hand drop from her mouth to reach toward something at her waist. The movement was careful. Deliberate. Not the gesture of someone overcome by emotion.

The gesture of someone executing planned action.

Cornelius's analytical processes accelerated. She was reaching for something. Something concealed in her dress perhaps. Something she had carried into the infirmary despite the guards. Despite the supervision.

Something small enough to hide. Valuable enough to risk discovery.

His certainty ticked upward. Eighty percent now. Possibly eighty-five.

He needed better visual access. Needed to see her hands. Needed to identify what she was retrieving before she could administer it.

Cornelius spread his wings. The movement was minimal. Just enough to shift his position fractionally to the left. The new angle provided slightly improved view past her shoulder.

He focused his forensic vision. Concentrated on the space near her waist where her hand had moved.

There.

A small vial. Glass. Approximately two inches in length. Stoppered with cork. Containing crystalline granules that caught the lamplight.

Blue-violet crystalline granules.

Judgment Salt.

Cornelius's chest constricted. The theory was confirmed. The hypothesis proven. Chloe Karellas had brought poison into the infirmary. Was preparing to administer it to unconscious victim. Was moments away from completing what she had started at the tribunal.

He needed to alert Captain Melas immediately. Needed to signal danger. Needed to—

"I did not want to do this again." Chloe's voice was ragged now. Thick with tears. "But you survived. You survived and that means you are not as guilty as he was. Not as deeply corrupt. But you are still guilty. Still contaminated. Still threatening everything I love."

She held the vial up to the lamplight. Examined the contents with terrible focus.

"The first dose was not enough," she continued. Speaking to unconscious Valerian as though he could hear. As though this was confession rather than execution. "Your guilt was not strong enough. Not absolute enough. So I have to try again. Have to make certain. Have to finish this properly."

Cornelius felt cold certainty replace analytical speculation. She was not here to mourn. Was not here to comfort dying partner. She was here to kill.

Was here to correct her previous attempt's failure.

He needed to move. Needed to alert. Needed to—

Captain Melas was already moving.

The Captain's hand went to his baton. His body shifted into intervention stance. The guards responded immediately. Moving toward Chloe with professional efficiency.

"Step away from the patient," Captain Melas said. His voice was hard. Absolute. "Put down the vial. Put your hands where I can see them."

Chloe froze. The vial was still in her hand. Still uncorked. Still containing enough Judgment Salt to kill if administered properly.

"Captain." Her voice shifted. No longer broken with grief. Steady now. Controlled. "I need you to understand. This is necessary. This is justice. This is—"

"This is attempted murder." Melas took another step forward. "Put down the vial. Final warning."

Cornelius saw Chloe's shoulders tense. Saw her hand tighten around the glass. Saw the calculations happening behind her composed expression.

She was Siren. Young. Untrained in combat. But Sirens possessed voices that could shatter stone. Could compel action. Could turn guards against their captain with sufficient desperation and properly applied magical influence.

If she screamed—truly screamed with full Siren power—the consequences would be catastrophic. The infirmary would collapse. The guards would be incapacitated. Valerian would die in the chaos.

And Chloe would escape.

Cornelius needed to prevent that outcome. Needed to stop her before she could employ her voice as weapon. But he was small dragon fifteen feet away concealed in doorway. By the time he reached her, she would have already acted.

Unless he provided Captain Melas with different approach.

Unless he remembered something relevant from his extensive archival knowledge.

Something about Sirens. About their nature. About the codes and customs that governed their magic and their honor.

Cornelius's mind raced through catalogued information. Through volumes read and indexed. Through obscure legal texts and cultural documentation. Through the vast accumulated knowledge that constituted his hoard.

There.

Siren Law. The ancient protocols. The binding traditions.

He had read about them years ago. Had filed the information in mental archives as potentially useful but not immediately relevant. Had not expected to need detailed knowledge of Siren legal customs during his comfortable library existence.

But he needed that knowledge now.

Needed it desperately.

Cornelius withdrew from his observation position. Moved silently down the corridor toward where Zeph stood near Captain Melas's previous location. The young man's eyes tracked his movement. Questioning. Concerned.

"We have a problem," Cornelius said quietly. Keeping his voice below Siren hearing range. "Chloe has Judgment Salt. She is preparing to administer it. Captain Melas is attempting intervention but if she uses her voice—"

"She will bring down the building." Zeph's hand pressed against his temple. "I can feel it. The musical thing. It is building. Getting ready to—" He stopped. Swallowed. "She is scared. Desperate. She will scream if they try to grab her."

"Correct assessment." Cornelius's tail lashed once. "Physical restraint is not viable option. Siren scream at that proximity would cause structural damage. Would incapacitate guards. Would create sufficient chaos for escape or for completing her attack on Valerian."

"So what do we do?" Zeph's voice was strained. "We cannot just let her kill him."

"No. We cannot." Cornelius adjusted his spectacles. The familiar gesture helped organize his thoughts. "We need alternative approach. We need to bind her through different mechanism."

"What mechanism?"

"Siren Law." Cornelius began moving toward the service corridor. Toward the small preparation room where City Hall staff maintained supplies. "Ancient protocols. Cultural codes. Binding traditions that govern Siren behavior and magical honor."

Zeph followed. "I do not understand. What kind of protocols?"

"Sirens are governed by hospitality law. By codes of conduct regarding family, healing, and sacred spaces." Cornelius reached the preparation room door. Tested the handle. Locked. He gestured impatiently. "Do you have lockpicks?"

"Why would I have lockpicks?"

"You are sixteen-year-old boy. I assumed—"

"I am library intern. Not criminal." Zeph pulled a thin metal tool from his pocket. "I have book-repair kits. Sometimes they work on locks."

Cornelius did not ask why Zeph carried book-repair tools everywhere. The boy had been excellent student. Had absorbed proper archival practices. The tools were appropriate precaution.

The lock clicked open.

Cornelius pushed through the door. The preparation room was small. Utilitarian. Lined with shelves holding linens, medical supplies, and—

There.

Silver tea service. Tray. Pot. Cups. The equipment used for serving civic officials during council meetings. For providing refreshment during tedious administrative sessions.

For offering hospitality.

"Grab the tray," Cornelius instructed.

Zeph lifted the silver tray from the shelf. "What are we doing?"

"We are invoking Siren Law regarding hospitality and the tending of sick." Cornelius examined the tea pot. Empty. That was acceptable. The symbolism mattered more than actual beverage. "According to ancient protocols, a Siren who enters space dedicated to healing—who approaches someone ill or injured—cannot refuse offered hospitality without violating sacred obligation."

"Cannot refuse tea?" Zeph's voice was skeptical. "That is your plan? We offer her tea and she has to stop trying to kill Valerian?"

"Not merely tea. Hospitality." Cornelius's claws tapped against the silver surface. "The cultural prohibition is absolute. A Siren who refuses hospitality while tending the sick risks losing their honor. Their standing. Their magical connection to water and voice. The consequences are severe enough that no traditional Siren would violate the custom."

"But Chloe already murdered someone. She poisoned Lucchesi. She tried to kill Valerian. Why would she care about tea protocol?"

"Because she murdered for family. For protecting those she loves. For upholding what she perceives as moral duty." Cornelius's tail swished in thinking-rhythm. "She is not acting against Siren nature. She is acting from it. From the fierce protectiveness that defines her species. From the codes that govern proper behavior."

"So those codes include the tea thing?"

"The hospitality obligation. Yes." Cornelius hopped onto the tray. Arranged himself with maximum dignified effect. "If we enter the infirmary bearing clear symbols of hospitality. If we offer refreshment while she tends to unconscious patient. If we invoke the ancient protocols correctly. She will be bound. Will be unable to refuse. Will be compelled to accept and to cease her attack."

Zeph stared at him. "That is insane."

"That is civilized." Cornelius adjusted his spectacles. "We cannot restrain her physically. Cannot risk her using voice as weapon. But we can bind her through culture. Through the codes she was raised to honor. Through the obligations that run deeper than conscious choice."

"What if you are wrong?"

"Then we will have offered tea to potential murderer. And we will need to attempt less elegant intervention." Cornelius's wings folded with precision. "But I am approximately eighty-seven percent certain this will work."

Zeph's hand trembled slightly on the tray. "Eighty-seven percent."

"Considerably better than my previous certainty regarding Valerian." Cornelius met his gaze steadily. "I am learning caution. But some situations require action despite incomplete certainty. This is one of those situations."

The musical tension in Zeph's expression—the ozone scent that accompanied his danger sense—was strong. Present. But not peaking. Not screaming immediate threat the way it had when Valerian reached for poisoned water.

"Your headache," Cornelius said. "What does it tell you?"

Zeph closed his eyes. Breathed in the four-count pattern. "That she is about to do something terrible. That we need to stop her. That—" He opened his eyes. "That your plan is completely ridiculous but possibly the only thing that will work."

"Guardian sense is remarkably useful," Cornelius observed. "Even when the guidance it provides is qualified."

"Yeah. Great. So I carry you on a tea tray into a room with a murderer and we ask if she wants refreshment." Zeph lifted the tray. "This is the most library-dragon thing I have ever heard."

"Thank you."

"That was not compliment."

"I am choosing to interpret it as one." Cornelius settled his weight carefully. The tray was adequate. Not ideal. But sufficient for processional entrance. "We need to inform Captain Melas of the plan."

"He is going to think we are insane."

"Quite possibly." Cornelius's tail curled around the tea pot for stability. "But he is practical man. He will recognize that insane plan is preferable to Siren scream collapsing municipal building."

They moved back toward the infirmary. The corridor was quiet. Empty. Most witnesses had been released hours ago. Only the essential personnel remained. Only those directly involved in the investigation.

Only those who would witness whether Cornelius's eighty-seven percent certainty was sufficient.

Captain Melas was still in the doorway. His posture was tense. One hand on his baton. The guards had not moved closer to Chloe. Were maintaining position. Waiting for direction.

Inside the infirmary, Chloe stood frozen at Valerian's bedside. The vial was still in her hand. Still uncorked. Still ready.

Cornelius caught Captain Melas's eye. Gestured with one wing toward the corridor. The Captain's expression shifted through several complicated emotions. Confusion. Irritation. Exhausted resignation.

He stepped back from the doorway. Moved toward where Cornelius and Zeph waited with their silver tea service.

"What," the Captain said slowly, "are you doing?"

"Preventing structural collapse and apprehending suspect." Cornelius kept his voice low. "Chloe has Judgment Salt. She is preparing to administer second dose to Valerian. If you attempt physical restraint, she will scream. Full Siren power. The consequences will be catastrophic."

"I am aware of the risk." Captain Melas's jaw tightened. "I am attempting to establish verbal control. To de-escalate. To—"

"She will not de-escalate. She believes this is necessary justice. Believes she is protecting her family. Believes Valerian deserves death." Cornelius's claws tapped against the tray. "She will fight. Will use any method available. Including voice."

"So you propose we serve her tea?" The Captain's voice held thread of hysteria. "We politely request she stop murdering people and offer refreshment?"

"We invoke Siren Law regarding hospitality and sacred obligation." Cornelius explained the principle. The cultural prohibition. The consequences of violation. "She cannot refuse. Cannot maintain her attack. Must accept the offered hospitality or risk losing everything that defines her as Siren."

Captain Melas stared at him. Then at Zeph. Then back at the tea tray.

"This is your plan."

"This is my plan."

"Based on ancient Siren cultural customs that may or may not be binding in modern context."

"Based on thoroughly documented legal and anthropological precedent maintained across centuries of Siren civilization." Cornelius's tail swished. "I have read extensively on the subject. The obligation is absolute. The prohibition is sacred."

"And if you are wrong?"

"Then I will be wrong with tea service instead of collapsed building." Cornelius adjusted his spectacles. "Do you have superior alternative?"

The Captain was silent. His gaze moved back toward the infirmary. Toward Chloe standing at the bedside with poison in hand. Toward the guards who could not intervene without triggering disaster.

"No," he said finally. "I do not have superior alternative."

"Then we proceed with my plan."

"Your eighty-seven percent certain plan."

"Eighty-eight percent now." Cornelius had performed additional mental calculations. "The probability increases with each moment Chloe does not flee or attack. She is hesitating. Experiencing internal conflict. The cultural codes are already affecting her behavior even before we invoke them directly."

Captain Melas closed his eyes. Breathed out slowly. "I am going to regret this."

"Quite possibly." Cornelius settled deeper onto the tray. "But you will regret it with intact building and living witnesses."

"That is remarkably poor reassurance."

"I am library dragon. Not therapy professional."

Zeph made sound that might have been laugh or sob. His hands were steady on the tray despite the ozone scent that indicated his danger sense was still active. Still processing threat. Still uncertain about outcome.

But he was here. Was following Cornelius's lead. Was trusting the eighty-eight percent certainty and the ridiculous civilized plan.

Two liabilities working together. Making their own investigation. Taking action based on knowledge and desperation and stubborn refusal to fail again.

"We enter together," Cornelius said. "Captain Melas leads. Zeph carries the tray. I remain visible and unthreatening. We approach with clear symbol of hospitality. We offer refreshment. We invoke the sacred obligation. We give Chloe opportunity to choose between honoring her culture and completing her murder."

"And if she chooses murder?" Captain Melas asked.

"Then we will have learned important information about the limits of cultural prohibition." Cornelius's wings spread slightly. "But I do not believe she will. I believe—eighty-eight percent certainty—that the codes run deep enough to override even protective desperation."

"You are betting Valerian's life on cultural anthropology."

"I am betting Valerian's life on the fundamental nature of what it means to be Siren. On the bonds that define identity and honor and magical connection." Cornelius's tail curled tighter around the tea pot. "It is better wager than attempting to physically restrain someone whose voice can shatter stone."

Captain Melas was quiet for long moment. Then he nodded once. Short. Decisive.

"We proceed. But if this fails—if she attacks or screams or attempts to administer that poison—I will act immediately. Guards will restrain her regardless of consequences. Is that understood?"

"Perfectly understood." Cornelius adjusted his position on the tray. "Ready when you are."

"I am not remotely ready." The Captain moved toward the infirmary entrance. "But I am also out of better options. So we attempt insane library dragon plan. And we hope eighty-eight percent is sufficient."

Zeph lifted the tray. His breathing was still controlled. Four-count pattern. Managing anxiety through technique Cornelius had taught him weeks ago.

Good student. Excellent intern. Potentially remarkable partner if they both survived the next five minutes.

They moved toward the open infirmary doors. Toward Chloe and her poison. Toward unconscious Valerian and the guards and the terrible moment of testing whether civilization was stronger than desperation.

Toward tea service as weapon. As binding. As the most library-dragon solution to murder that Cornelius had ever devised.

He certainly hoped he was right.

Eighty-eight percent was considerably less than certainty. But it was the best calculation available with current data.

It would have to be enough.

Captain Melas stepped through the doorway. Zeph followed with the silver tray held steady. Cornelius perched in formal position. Wings folded. Spectacles precisely aligned. The very image of dignified professional service.

Chloe looked up from Valerian's bedside. Her eyes widened. The vial was still in her hand.

"Miss Karellas," Cornelius said clearly. His voice carried the full formal weight of library authority. Of ancient protocol. Of civilization meeting chaos with tea service and sacred obligation. "We have brought refreshment. Will you accept our hospitality?"
