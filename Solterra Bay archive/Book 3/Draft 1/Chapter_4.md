# Chapter 4

The Mayor's reception room smelled of beeswax polish and old leather, which Cornelius found marginally more tolerable than the Rotunda's cacophony of competing perfumes. He sat on the blue upholstered chair with his book balanced carefully on his lap, watching Captain Melas arrange his witnesses like a general positioning troops before battle.

The Watch captain had spent the last five minutes establishing rules, boundaries, and consequences. Cornelius respected the thoroughness even as he found it tedious. Melas was creating structure where chaos had reigned, imposing order on a situation that desperately required it. These were impulses Cornelius understood on a fundamental level.

"I will speak with each of you individually," Melas was saying, his weathered face set in grim lines. "Starting with Valerian, as Signore Lucchesi's assistant. The rest of you will wait here. No discussing the case amongst yourselves. No leaving this room without my explicit permission. Clear?"

Murmurs of assent circled the room.

Melas gestured to the Sphinx-kin. "Valerian. With me."

The tall figure in burgundy robes rose smoothly and followed the Captain through a side door that led, Cornelius assumed, to an even smaller private office. The door closed with a soft click.

Silence settled over the remaining occupants. Imelda had produced a small book from somewhere in her robes and was reading with apparent serenity. Chloe Karellas perched on the edge of her chair, her fingers drumming a nervous pattern on her knee. The woman in gray—still unnamed—stared at the floor, her handkerchief clutched in white-knuckled hands.

Cornelius's tail twitched with irritation. He had maneuvered his way into this group specifically to observe the investigation, not to sit in enforced silence while Melas conducted interviews one at a time in another room. This was inefficient. Wasteful. A poor use of his time and talents.

His claws flexed against the leather binding of his book. The signed inscription was still there, of course, perfectly preserved beneath the cover. *To Cornelius Drake, a fellow scholar who understands that knowledge is the foundation upon which all truth must rest. With admiration, Fabrizio Lucchesi.*

The irony was not lost on Cornelius that the man who had written those words was currently lying dead under a ceremonial cloth twenty yards away.

He needed to see the scene again. Properly this time, without the interference of panic and crowds. The podium, the glass, the wine spreading across marble—there would be evidence there. There had to be. People did not simply die at precisely orchestrated moments without leaving traces of cause and method.

Cornelius made his decision with the same swift certainty he applied to cataloguing decisions. Waiting here served no purpose. Examining the actual location of Lucchesi's death would.

He stood, tucking his book under one forearm.

Imelda glanced up from her reading. "Going somewhere?"

"I require access to the facilities," Cornelius said with perfect composure. "Unless Captain Melas expects us to remain confined without basic accommodations?"

The Head Librarian's expression suggested she knew exactly what Cornelius was actually planning, but she merely raised one elegant eyebrow. "I imagine the facilities are in the hall. Do try not to cause additional complications."

"I never cause complications," Cornelius replied. "I resolve them."

He crossed to the main door and pushed it open with one wing. The corridor beyond was quieter than before, though he could hear the low murmur of voices from the Rotunda's direction. Two guards stood at attention near the reception room, but neither moved to stop him as he padded down the hallway.

The Grand Rotunda had transformed yet again. The crowd had thinned considerably—Melas's guards had clearly processed the least relevant witnesses and released them from the six-hour detention window. Perhaps two dozen people remained, clustered in small groups and speaking in hushed tones. The atmosphere had shifted from panic to something more unsettling: the peculiar quiet that followed violence, when everyone was still processing what they had witnessed.

The platform where Lucchesi had delivered his speech stood empty except for the covered body. Two guards flanked it, their expressions professionally neutral. The ceremonial cloth draped over the corpse was deep blue, embroidered with the city's seal in silver thread. Someone—probably Mayor Barca's staff—had cleaned up the spilled wine, though Cornelius could still see a faint stain on the marble where the glass had shattered.

He needed closer access. The podium itself would contain the most useful evidence—anything Lucchesi had touched, anything that had been near his glass, any trace of what had killed him.

Cornelius spread his wings and lifted off silently, gliding up toward the second-floor gallery. Flying had certain advantages when dealing with guards who were trained to watch for people walking. He landed on the stone balustrade and made his way around the curve until he was directly above the platform.

From this vantage point, he could see the entire scene laid out below him. The podium stood slightly to the left of center stage, a simple wooden structure with a slanted reading surface. Lucchesi's notes—pages of carefully prepared remarks—still rested there, their edges fluttering slightly in the air currents from the Rotunda's ventilation.

The wine glass and decanter had been removed, presumably already in Melas's custody for examination. But the platform itself, the floor, the immediate area where Lucchesi had stood for those final moments—those had not been thoroughly searched. Cornelius could tell by the way the guards stood. They were protecting the body, not preserving a crime scene. Melas had not yet had time to conduct a proper forensic examination.

Which meant Cornelius had a window of opportunity.

He glanced down at the guards. They were facing outward, watching the remaining guests rather than looking up. Cornelius calculated angles, trajectory, and the likely location of visual blind spots.

Then he folded his wings and dropped.

The controlled descent brought him down behind the podium, in the space between the wooden structure and the backdrop of ceremonial curtains. His claws touched the platform without sound. He froze, waiting to see if the guards had noticed.

Neither turned.

Excellent.

Cornelius crept forward, keeping his body low and his movements precise. His book remained tucked against his chest—he would not set it down, not even to investigate a murder. Some priorities were non-negotiable.

The podium's reading surface held Lucchesi's speech notes, now irrelevant testimony to a presentation that had ended in death. Cornelius ignored them. Paper and ink told stories, certainly, but not the story he needed right now.

He focused on the floor immediately around the podium's base. This was where Lucchesi had stood. Where he had raised his glass. Where he had taken that fatal sip.

Cornelius's vision sharpened, shifted into the particular clarity that came from being a creature formed from knowledge itself. Other dragons saw in darkness or detected heat. Library Dragons saw truth written in physical forms—the age of paper, the composition of ink, the molecular structure of materials.

He examined the wooden floor of the platform, inch by meticulous inch.

There—just at the base of the podium's left leg. A scatter of tiny granules, barely visible against the dark wood. Blue. Crystalline. No larger than grains of sand.

Cornelius's breath caught.

He moved closer, his golden eyes narrowing behind his spectacles. The crystals glittered faintly in the lamplight, their color a distinctive azure that seemed to shift between blue and violet depending on the angle. They formed a small cluster, perhaps a dozen grains, as if someone had spilled a pinch of something and not noticed.

Or had not cared.

His mind began cataloguing possibilities. Blue crystal formations. Magical residue. Alchemical compounds. There were perhaps fifteen substances in Solterra Bay that matched this description, and Cornelius knew the properties of all of them. But he needed closer examination to determine which—

A flash of pale wood caught his attention.

Three inches from the blue crystals, caught in a gap between two floorboards, was a single pencil shaving. Cedar, based on the color and grain pattern. Curled into a perfect spiral, the kind produced by a very sharp blade applied at a precise angle.

Cornelius tilted his head, studying it. A pencil shaving at a formal gala. Incongruous. People used fountain pens for formal occasions, not pencils. And certainly no one sharpened pencils on a ceremonial platform during a major speech.

Unless the shaving had been there before the speech. Or had fallen from someone's pocket. Or—

"Master Drake."

Cornelius's wings snapped tight against his body. He looked up to find Captain Melas standing at the edge of the platform, arms crossed, expression hovering somewhere between exasperation and resignation.

"Captain," Cornelius said with as much dignity as he could muster while crouched behind a podium he was not supposed to be examining. "I was just—"

"Investigating my crime scene without permission." Melas's voice was flat. "Yes. I noticed."

"I prefer to think of it as conducting a preliminary survey to assist your official investigation."

"I prefer to think of it as you ignoring my explicit instructions." The Watch captain climbed onto the platform, his boots heavy on the wooden boards. "I told you to wait in the reception room."

"You told me I could not interrogate witnesses or touch evidence. I have done neither." Cornelius straightened, adjusting his spectacles with one claw. "I have merely observed."

"With your face six inches from my crime scene."

"Observation requires proximity." Cornelius glanced back at the blue crystals and the pencil shaving. "And I have found something you should examine."

Melas's expression shifted slightly. "Found what?"

"Come see for yourself."

The Captain moved to Cornelius's position and crouched, studying the floor where Cornelius indicated. His weathered face revealed nothing, but Cornelius saw the way his eyes narrowed, the subtle shift in his posture that indicated sharp attention.

"Blue crystals and wood shavings," Melas said after a moment. "What am I looking at?"

"Evidence." Cornelius resisted the urge to touch the crystals, though he desperately wanted to examine them more closely. "The blue granules are some form of crystalline compound. The shaving is cedar, freshly cut based on the color preservation. Both are out of place at a formal event."

"Could have been here before the gala. Maintenance oversight."

"Possible but unlikely. This platform was specifically prepared for tonight's event. The wood has been polished recently—I can see the oil residue. Any debris from earlier preparation would have been removed." Cornelius moved his wing to indicate the crystals without touching them. "These were deposited within the last few hours."

Melas pulled a small evidence envelope from his coat and carefully collected the blue crystals using a pair of tweezers. Then he did the same with the pencil shaving, sealing both in separate containers and labeling them with quick, efficient handwriting.

"You should not have been here," he said as he worked. "But I suppose I should thank you for the sharp eyes."

"You should employ me as a formal consultant," Cornelius said. "My visual acuity exceeds that of any human investigator, and my knowledge of potentially relevant substances is encyclopedic."

"I will take that under advisement." Melas stood, pocketing the evidence. "Now get back to the reception room before I decide you are more trouble than you are worth."

Cornelius spread his wings to comply, then paused. "Captain. When you identify what those crystals are, I would appreciate being informed. I have... theories."

"I am sure you do." Melas gestured toward the edge of the platform. "Go. And Master Drake? No more unauthorized investigations."

"Of course not," Cornelius said, in a tone that promised absolutely nothing.

He glided down from the platform and landed near the eastern colonnade, folding his wings with deliberate precision. His mind was already sorting through the catalog of blue crystalline substances, cross-referencing properties and potential applications. The color was distinctive. The size suggested careful grinding or natural formation at a specific temperature range. And the location—scattered at the base of the podium where Lucchesi had stood—

"Master Drake?"

Cornelius turned to find Zeph approaching from the direction of the washrooms. The boy looked marginally better than he had earlier, though his face was still drawn and his movements careful. He also looked miserable in a way that had nothing to do with physical pain.

"Zephyr." Cornelius examined his intern with clinical attention. "Your color has improved. The headache?"

"Fading." Zeph glanced around the Rotunda, his expression wary. "Most people left already. Captain Melas let them go if they were far from the platform and didn't see anything useful."

"Sensible. Detaining two dozen irrelevant witnesses for six hours serves no investigative purpose." Cornelius tilted his head. "You appear distressed beyond your usual level of gala-induced misery. What happened?"

Zeph's jaw tightened. "I tried to talk to Sophia."

"Ah."

"It went badly."

"I surmised as much from your expression." Cornelius glanced across the Rotunda, where Sophia stood with her family near the southern colonnade. The girl was not looking in their direction. "Elaborate."

"I found her in the hallway. Wanted to apologize for earlier, for running out on her mom's questions." Zeph's hands clenched into fists. "Started to explain about the headache, about how the noise gets too much, about—"

He stopped, his breath hitching.

Cornelius recognized the signs immediately. The slight widening of the eyes. The tension in the shoulders. The way Zeph's hands moved to his temples as if to physically hold his skull together.

"The pain returned," Cornelius said.

"Middle of the conversation," Zeph confirmed, his voice tight. "Just slammed into me. Couldn't finish a sentence. Sophia kept asking if I was okay, and I couldn't even answer her properly. Just stood there like an idiot, making these pathetic half-sounds while my head felt like it was splitting open."

"What did she do?"

"Called one of the healers over. They checked me out, said nothing was physically wrong, recommended rest." Zeph's expression was bleak. "Sophia looked at me like—like she doesn't know if I'm actually sick or just looking for excuses to avoid her family."

Cornelius's tail moved in a sharp, irritated gesture. The Doukas girl was operating from fear and ignorance, which made her reaction understandable but not helpful. And Zeph's condition, whatever its ultimate cause, was clearly genuine. Cornelius had seen enough of the boy's episodes to know they were not performance.

"Miss Doukas is struggling to reconcile her established understanding of normal human physiology with evidence that contradicts it," Cornelius said. "This creates cognitive dissonance, which manifests as doubt regarding your veracity."

"She thinks I'm lying."

"She thinks you might be exaggerating, which is different. Though the practical effect on your relationship is similarly detrimental." Cornelius adjusted his book, using the familiar weight to ground his thoughts. "You cannot control her interpretation of events. You can only control your own behavior and truthfulness."

"Great. So I just keep collapsing in front of her until she either believes me or dumps me."

"Or until we determine the actual cause of your condition and address it properly." Cornelius fixed Zeph with a steady gaze. "These headaches are not normal. The sensory overload is not normal. The scent I detect around you during episodes is definitely not normal."

Zeph blinked. "Scent?"

"Like air before a lightning strike. Ozone and electricity." Cornelius kept his voice matter-of-fact. "I noticed it during your first episode tonight and again just now when you mentioned the pain returning. You are manifesting some form of atmospheric change when under distress."

"That's..." Zeph trailed off, looking unsettled. "That's not possible."

"And yet it occurs. Which suggests either a previously undiagnosed magical sensitivity or something more fundamental about your nature that has not yet been properly identified." Cornelius filed away Zeph's reaction for later analysis. "But this is not the time for that investigation. We are currently occupied with determining who killed Fabrizio Lucchesi and why."

"Right. The murder." Zeph straightened slightly, though he still looked drained. "Did you find anything useful?"

"Potentially." Cornelius glanced back toward the platform, where the guards still flanked Lucchesi's covered body. "Blue crystals and a pencil shaving near the podium. Both out of place at a formal event. Captain Melas has collected them as evidence."

"Blue crystals? Like, drugs?"

"Unlikely at this particular social stratum, though I will not rule anything out until chemical analysis is complete." Cornelius's mind was still turning over possibilities, sorting and categorizing. "The color and crystalline structure suggest several possibilities. I will need access to reference materials to narrow the options."

"Which means you want to go back to the Library."

"Eventually. First I intend to remain here long enough to observe the conclusion of Captain Melas's initial interviews." Cornelius moved toward an unoccupied chair near the colonnade and climbed onto it, settling with his book in his lap. "Sit. Rest. Try not to have another episode. And avoid Miss Doukas for the remainder of the evening unless you wish to have an emotional conversation while trapped in a sealed building."

Zeph sat on the floor beside the chair, leaning back against the column. "Avoiding Sophia. Got it."

They lapsed into silence. Around them, the Rotunda maintained its eerie quiet. Guards stood at attention. Remaining witnesses spoke in hushed clusters. Somewhere in the Mayor's reception room, Captain Melas was questioning Valerian about Lucchesi's final hours.

And on the platform, beneath the ceremonial cloth, a man lay dead.

Cornelius's claws drummed thoughtfully against his book's leather binding. Blue crystals. Cedar shavings. A death timed to the precise moment of a toast. The elements were present for a solution. He simply needed to arrange them in the correct pattern.

His mind drifted back to the crystals. That particular shade of blue, shifting to violet in certain light. The size of the granules. The way they had scattered in a loose cluster rather than a uniform distribution.

And then, with the sudden clarity of a reference shelf appearing in his mind's eye, Cornelius knew.

"Judgment Salt," he said aloud.

Zeph looked up. "What?"

Cornelius's golden eyes were fixed on the middle distance, seeing not the Rotunda but the pages of a book he had read fifteen years ago. *Rare Compounds of the Eastern Provinces*, third edition, chapter seven. "The blue crystals. They are Judgment Salt."

"Never heard of it."

"Most people have not. It is exceedingly rare and expensive to produce." Cornelius's tail began moving in slow, thoughtful arcs. "An alchemical compound with very specific properties. When ingested, it has no effect on the innocent. But for those who carry guilt—particularly for serious crimes—it acts as a rapid and potent poison."

Zeph went very still. "It only kills guilty people?"

"In theory." Cornelius's mind was racing now, implications cascading through his consciousness like books falling from an overstuffed shelf. "Though the precise mechanism of how it determines guilt is poorly understood. Some scholars believe it responds to the subject's own moral certainty. Others theorize it detects aetheric disruption caused by deliberate harm to others."

"So someone used magic poison that only kills bad people." Zeph's voice was carefully neutral. "On Fabrizio Lucchesi. Who wrote books about aether theory."

"Yes."

"Which means—"

"Which means," Cornelius finished, his claws tightening on his book, "that either our killer believed Lucchesi was guilty of something worth execution, or Lucchesi actually was guilty, and the Judgment Salt simply enacted its intended function."

His gaze moved back to the covered body on the platform. The famous author. The respected scholar. The man who had signed Cornelius's book with words about truth and knowledge.

What had Fabrizio Lucchesi done to deserve death by Judgment Salt?

And who had known enough to use it?
