# Chapter 3

The Grand Rotunda had descended into barely controlled pandemonium.

Cornelius stood in the service corridor doorway, his book pressed firmly against his chest, and watched as Captain Melas strode into the center of the chaos like a man wading into a tide. The Watch captain raised one hand, and his voice cut through the noise with the authority of someone who had spent three decades shouting orders at people who did not wish to hear them.

"Nobody leaves this building!"

The effect was immediate. Conversations stopped mid-word. A woman near the refreshment tables froze with a wine glass halfway to her lips. Even the string quartet—who had been attempting to pack their instruments in a corner—went still.

Melas gestured sharply to his guards. "Bar the main doors. Post someone at every exit, including the service entrances. If it opens to the street, I want a body in front of it."

Two guards moved immediately toward the Rotunda's grand entrance, a set of bronze-fitted doors that normally stood open to welcome the city's elite. They swung the heavy panels closed with a boom that echoed off the dome overhead. A thick bar—kept in brackets for exactly this purpose—was lifted into place.

The sound of wood settling into iron was unmistakable. Final.

Cornelius's tail twitched. He was trapped. They were all trapped, sealed inside City Hall like specimens in a jar.

He should have felt outraged. Inconvenienced at minimum. He had his book. He had his signed inscription. His evening's objective had been achieved, and now he was being detained by civic bureaucracy and a corpse that was, frankly, no longer his concern.

Instead, Cornelius felt a small, traitorous spark of satisfaction.

If someone had poisoned Fabrizio Lucchesi—and the timing certainly suggested poison—then the killer was now contained within these walls. No escape. No opportunity to dispose of evidence or flee to a convenient alibi. Captain Melas had just created a perfect closed system, all variables accounted for, all elements catalogued and controlled.

It was, Cornelius had to admit, exactly what he would have done.

"This is an outrage!" A man in elaborate silk robes pushed forward from the crowd. Cornelius recognized him as one of the minor shipping merchants, someone who donated to the Library annually in exchange for having his name on a small plaque. "You cannot hold us prisoner! We have done nothing wrong!"

"Nobody said you did anything wrong." Melas's tone suggested he was already exhausted and the night had barely begun. "But a man is dead. Until I know why and how, nobody goes anywhere. Those are the rules."

"What rules?" The merchant's face had gone red. "Show me the statute that allows you to—"

"Maritime Commerce Act, Section Twelve, Subsection Four." Cornelius's voice carried clearly from the doorway. "In cases of suspicious death on civic property, the ranking Watch officer may secure the premises and detain witnesses for a period not to exceed six hours without formal charges. It has been city law since the harbormaster's poisoning of 1847."

Every head in the Rotunda turned toward him.

Cornelius adjusted his spectacles with one claw, his expression carefully neutral. "I believe you will find the Captain is operating well within his legal authority."

The merchant's mouth opened and closed without sound. Melas's gaze found Cornelius across the crowd, and something that might have been grim amusement flickered across the Watch captain's weathered face.

"Thank you, Master Drake." Melas's tone was dry. "I appreciate the legal expertise."

"I contain multitudes of legal expertise." Cornelius remained in the doorway, wings folded tight against his sides. "The Library maintains complete archives of Solterra's civic codes. I have read them all. Twice."

"Of course you have." Melas turned back to the crowd, raising his voice. "Here is what happens next. My guards will take your names and your positions in the room at the time of Signore Lucchesi's collapse. This will be orderly. This will be efficient. The faster you cooperate, the faster you go home. Clear?"

Murmurs rippled through the assembled guests, but the protests had lost their edge. People began organizing themselves into rough groups, clustering by family or business association. The panic was fading, replaced by the resigned irritation of the wealthy forced to endure minor inconvenience.

Cornelius watched the transformation with clinical interest. Humans were herd animals at their core. Give them clear instructions and the appearance of authority, and they would usually comply. It was one of their more useful traits.

"Master Drake." Melas had crossed the Rotunda while Cornelius was observing the crowd. The Watch captain stood just outside the service corridor, his expression carefully controlled. "A word, if you please."

Cornelius glanced at Zeph, who had settled on the floor of the corridor with his back against the wall and his eyes closed. The boy's color had improved slightly, though he still looked like something recently retrieved from the bottom of a harbor.

"Zephyr," Cornelius said quietly. "Remain here. Do not move. Do not speak to anyone. Do not do anything that might result in additional complications."

"Not moving," Zeph mumbled. "Not speaking. Definitely not complicating."

"Excellent." Cornelius tucked his book more securely under one arm and followed Melas a short distance down the corridor, out of the boy's hearing.

The Watch captain turned to face him, arms crossed. "You want to tell me why you were fleeing through the service exit?"

"I was not fleeing. I was escorting my intern to a location with fewer people, less noise, and better air circulation. His condition required it." Cornelius met Melas's gaze without flinching. "You saw him yourself. The boy could barely stand."

"True enough." Melas tilted his head slightly, studying Cornelius the way one might study a particularly complicated knot. "But you chose to leave through the back instead of requesting a healer. Why?"

"Because I am not a physician, and I correctly assessed that the Rotunda would shortly become far more chaotic than it already was." Cornelius's tail flicked once, a sharp gesture of impatience. "I made a tactical decision to remove Zephyr from an environment that was actively worsening his symptoms. There is no mystery here, Captain. Only basic logic."

"Mm." Melas did not look convinced, but he did not press the point. "And the book you're clutching like it's made of solid gold?"

"It is a first edition of *The Theory of Aether*, signed by Fabrizio Lucchesi approximately thirty minutes before his death." Cornelius's claws tightened protectively on the leather binding. "It is worth considerably more than solid gold, and I will not be parted from it under any circumstances short of direct divine intervention."

"Not asking you to give it up." Melas's mouth twitched, though whether toward a smile or a grimace was unclear. "Just making sure you're not hiding evidence in there."

The implication made Cornelius's scales prickle with indignation. "If I were concealing evidence, Captain, I would choose a far less conspicuous location than a rare book I have been visibly protecting all evening. I would also be significantly more subtle in my departure. I am many things, but incompetent is not among them."

"No. You're not incompetent." Melas's expression shifted, becoming more serious. "Which is why I'm going to ask you directly. Did you see anything unusual tonight? Before Lucchesi fell?"

Cornelius considered the question. He could refuse to answer—technically, Melas had not yet taken his formal statement, and this conversation existed in a legal gray area. But there was also value in appearing cooperative. And, more importantly, the question itself was interesting.

"Define unusual," Cornelius said carefully.

"Anything that struck you as wrong. Out of place. Inconsistent with expectations."

Cornelius's mind sorted through the evening's events, cataloguing and cross-referencing. "Lucchesi's speech was vapid but not unusually so for his recent work. His toast followed traditional ceremonial format. The wine was poured from a common decanter and distributed by servers to all the guests simultaneously. I observed no one approaching Lucchesi's glass specifically, though my vantage point was limited."

"Where exactly were you standing?"

"Eastern colonnade. Approximately forty feet from the platform. My attention was divided between the speech and monitoring Zephyr's condition." Cornelius paused, his analytical mind catching on a detail. "Though I did note that Lucchesi's hands were not entirely steady when he opened my book for signing. I attributed this to nerves or excessive wine consumption, but it could indicate an underlying medical condition."

Melas pulled a small notebook from his coat pocket and made a brief notation. "Anything else?"

"The onset of his collapse was extremely rapid. Three to four seconds between drinking and falling. That timing suggests either a very potent poison or a catastrophic failure of a vital organ." Cornelius tilted his head, his golden eyes narrowing behind his spectacles. "You have already reached this conclusion yourself. You would not have sealed the building otherwise."

"Maybe I'm just being thorough."

"You are being thorough and suspicious, which is appropriate given the circumstances." Cornelius adjusted his glasses. "You will check Lucchesi's glass for residue, examine the wine decanter, and interview all the servers who handled the refreshments. You will also speak with everyone who had access to the platform in the hour before the speech. Standard investigative procedure."

"Thanks for the instruction." Melas's tone was bone-dry. "Anything else I should know about my own job?"

"Several things, but you are unlikely to appreciate the input." Cornelius folded his wings more tightly against his body. "I assume we are finished here?"

"For now. I'll need your formal statement later." Melas gestured back toward the Rotunda. "Keep the boy in sight. Keep yourself available. And Master Drake? Do not try to leave again."

"I gave you my legal analysis of your authority." Cornelius started back toward the corridor. "I did not say I planned to test it."

He found Zeph exactly where he had left him, though the boy had slumped further down the wall and appeared to be either sleeping or unconscious. Cornelius nudged him with one wing.

"Still alive?"

"Debatable," Zeph muttered without opening his eyes.

"Can you walk?"

"Why?"

"Because remaining in a corridor while the Captain organizes his investigation is inefficient and exposes you to unnecessary traffic." Cornelius glanced back toward the Rotunda, where guards were beginning to organize the guests into groups. "We are going to relocate to a more defensible position."

"Sure. Fine. Whatever." Zeph pushed himself upright with visible effort, using the wall for support. "Where are we relocating to?"

"I have not decided yet." Cornelius spread his wings and lifted off the ground, hovering at eye level with the boy. "But staying here guarantees we will be interrogated last, after hours of tedious waiting. I prefer to control my schedule rather than have it controlled for me."

They emerged from the service corridor into the Rotunda proper. The chaos had transformed into organized activity. Mayor Barca stood on the platform near Lucchesi's covered body—someone had draped a ceremonial cloth over the corpse—giving instructions to a cluster of assistants. Guards moved through the crowd, separating people into groups. A healer Cornelius did not recognize was speaking quietly with Captain Melas near the main doors.

The crowd itself had sorted into rough social strata. The Tile Families and other prominent citizens clustered near the center of the room, their expressions ranging from impatient to outraged. Lesser merchants and civic officials occupied the middle distance. At the edges, servers and musicians huddled in uncomfortable silence, clearly aware they would be the last interviewed and the first suspected.

Cornelius's gaze swept across the assembly, his mind automatically cataloguing important details. Sophia Doukas stood with her family near the southern colonnade, her face tear-streaked but composed. She did not look in Zeph's direction, which suggested either she had not seen him or she was deliberately ignoring him. Neither option boded well for the boy's romantic prospects.

Near the platform, a woman Cornelius did not immediately recognize was speaking with Mayor Barca. She wore a dark gray gown cut in an academic style, and her hands moved expressively as she talked. Something about her posture suggested distress, though she was controlling it with visible effort.

"Who is that?" Zeph asked quietly, following Cornelius's gaze.

"Unknown. Though given her position near the Mayor and her emotional state, I would speculate she is connected to Lucchesi in some professional capacity." Cornelius adjusted his spectacles, wishing he had a better angle. "She is either deeply affected by his death or an excellent performer."

"Maybe both."

"A possibility worth noting."

A sharp whistle cut through the ambient noise. Captain Melas stood in the center of the Rotunda, two fingers still at his lips. "Attention! The Mayor has provided a private room for key witnesses. The following individuals will come with me now: Imelda Kassiani, Valerian Sphinx, Chloe Karellas, and the woman I just saw speaking with Mayor Barca—that would be you, miss."

The woman in gray nodded, dabbing at her eyes with a handkerchief.

Cornelius's interest sharpened immediately. Those were not random selections. Imelda was the Head Librarian and one of the city's most respected intellectuals. The Karellas name belonged to a prominent shipping family. A Sphinx-kin would be valuable in any investigation—their species could not lie without physical symptoms. And the unknown woman had just been elevated to "key witness" status.

This was the core of the investigation. The people closest to Lucchesi. The ones who might know why someone would want him dead.

The ones Cornelius needed to observe.

He made his decision in the space of two heartbeats.

"Zephyr." Cornelius kept his voice low. "Stay here. Find somewhere to sit. Do not engage with Sophia or her family. When the guards take your statement, provide only factual observations—what you saw and heard, nothing more. Do you understand?"

"Yeah, I understand. Where are you going?"

"To join the key witnesses."

Zeph's eyes widened. "They're not going to let you just walk in there."

"They will absolutely attempt to prevent it." Cornelius adjusted his grip on his book, tucking it more securely against his chest. "Which is why I will not be walking."

Before Zeph could protest, Cornelius launched himself upward. His wings caught the air, and he spiraled up toward the Rotunda's painted dome. Below, a few guests noticed and pointed. Cornelius ignored them with the practiced ease of someone who had spent over a century being stared at.

He reached the stone railing of the second-floor gallery and landed with precision, folding his wings. From this vantage point, he could see the entire Rotunda laid out like a diagram. Captain Melas was leading his selected witnesses toward a corridor on the western side—likely toward the Mayor's private reception room. If Cornelius timed this correctly, he could intercept them before the door closed.

He followed the gallery's curve, moving quickly along the balustrade. His claws clicked softly on the marble. Below, the crowd had returned to nervous waiting, their attention focused on the guards taking statements rather than on the small dragon circumnavigating the upper level.

Cornelius reached the western side just as Melas and his group entered the corridor. He spread his wings and dropped from the gallery, gliding down in a controlled descent that ended precisely in front of the Watch captain.

Melas stopped short, nearly colliding with him. "Master Drake."

"Captain." Cornelius settled on the floor, his book still clutched protectively. "I am joining this group."

"No. You are not."

"I am absolutely joining this group. I possess crucial knowledge of the victim's work, expertise in document analysis that may prove relevant to your investigation, and a demonstrated capacity for logical deduction that exceeds—"

"You're a witness, not an investigator." Melas crossed his arms. "And you're going to turn around and wait with everyone else for your statement to be taken."

"I have already provided you with preliminary observations. I am now offering my services as a consultant." Cornelius drew himself up to his full height, which was admittedly not impressive in absolute terms but which carried a certain rhetorical weight nonetheless. "I am the Library Dragon of Solterra Bay. Fabrizio Lucchesi signed my book tonight because he respected my expertise in aetheric theory. I knew his early work better than anyone in this building, possibly better than he knew it himself. If you are investigating his death, you need my knowledge."

"What I need," Melas said slowly, "is for you to stop being difficult and go wait with the other witnesses."

"I am not being difficult. I am being useful. There is a significant difference."

Behind Melas, Imelda stepped forward. The Head Librarian was an elegant woman who radiated calm authority the way lamps radiated light. Her silver-white hair was wound with copper beads that clicked softly as she moved. Her expression, as always, was serene.

"Theodoros." She placed one hand on the Captain's shoulder. "Let him come."

Melas turned, his expression pained. "Imelda, I am trying to run an investigation here. I cannot have every interested party simply deciding to include themselves because they feel like it."

"Cornelius does not feel like anything. He thinks. Constantly. Often to the point of being insufferable." Imelda's gaze shifted to Cornelius, one eyebrow raised. "You are being insufferable at the moment."

"I am being thorough," Cornelius corrected.

"You are being both." Imelda looked back at Melas. "But he is also correct that his knowledge of Lucchesi's work is unmatched. If you are going to question us about the victim, having Cornelius present may save time. He can verify facts, provide context, and catch inconsistencies."

Melas stared at her for a long moment. Then he sighed, the exhalation of a man who had lost an argument before it truly began. "Fine. He can observe. But Master Drake? You will be silent unless I ask you a direct question. You will not interrogate my witnesses. You will not touch anything. Clear?"

"Perfectly clear, Captain." Cornelius's tail swished once, a gesture of satisfaction. "I shall be a model of decorum."

Melas muttered something that sounded like "doubt that" but gestured for the group to continue down the corridor. They proceeded in silence, their footsteps echoing off the stone walls.

The Mayor's reception room stood at the corridor's end, its door marked with the city's seal. Melas opened it and ushered them inside.

The space was smaller than Cornelius had expected but elegantly appointed. Comfortable chairs upholstered in deep blue fabric ringed a low table. Oil lamps hung from bronze fixtures, casting warm light across walls decorated with framed maps of Solterra Bay's historical development. A sidebar held a tea service, untouched.

Cornelius counted five people in addition to himself and Melas. Imelda settled into a chair near the window with the grace of someone entirely comfortable in any environment. The woman in gray took a seat opposite her, still clutching her handkerchief. A young siren woman—Chloe Karellas, based on the Captain's earlier announcement—perched on the edge of a chair, her expression wary. And there, standing rather than sitting, was a figure Cornelius had not seen clearly in the Rotunda.

The Sphinx-kin was tall and angular, with the golden eyes and tufted ears characteristic of his kind. He wore scholar's robes in deep burgundy, and his expression was carefully neutral. When he noticed Cornelius's attention, he inclined his head in acknowledgment.

"Valerian," he said quietly. "I was Signore Lucchesi's assistant."

"Cornelius Drake." Cornelius moved to an unoccupied chair and climbed onto its seat, settling with his book in his lap. "I am the Library Dragon, and I am here to help Captain Melas understand what happened tonight."

Melas closed the door and turned to face them, his weathered face set in grim lines. "Let me be clear. A man is dead. Until I know why and how, everyone in this room is a witness. Some of you may be suspects. I will be asking questions. You will provide honest answers. If you refuse, I will hold you here until you change your mind or my time limit expires." His gaze swept across them. "Anyone have a problem with that?"

Silence.

"Good." Melas pulled out his notebook. "Then let us begin."

Cornelius settled into the chair, his claws resting lightly on his book. Around him, the key witnesses to Fabrizio Lucchesi's death waited for their interrogation. Outside, the Rotunda was sealed. The investigation had begun.

And Cornelius, despite his repeated insistence that he was merely a librarian, found himself exactly where he had known he would end up.

At the center of the mystery.
