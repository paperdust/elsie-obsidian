# Chapter 6

"This way."

Captain Melas pulled open the door to his temporary office without ceremony. The hinges protested with a soft groan that suggested they had not been oiled in some time. Cornelius made a mental note of the oversight, catalogued it as evidence of City Hall's declining maintenance standards, and followed the Watch captain into the smaller room.

The Mayor's private office was precisely what Cornelius expected: expensive, traditional, and designed to reinforce hierarchies. Dark wood paneling covered three walls. The fourth held floor-to-ceiling shelves containing legal codes, civic records, and what appeared to be a decorative collection of antique maritime instruments that no one had touched in decades. The air smelled of beeswax polish and old leather, with an undertone of pipe tobacco that suggested Mayor Barca spent more time here than in the ceremonial spaces beyond.

A substantial desk dominated the center of the room—solid oak, probably a century old, with carved legs depicting maritime scenes. Two chairs faced it. Behind it sat the mayor's high-backed seat, currently unoccupied.

Melas gestured toward one of the facing chairs. "Sit."

Valerian moved to comply, his burgundy robes rustling. The Sphinx's hands trembled slightly as he lowered himself into the seat. His golden eyes darted between Melas and Cornelius, pupils contracting to vertical slits that marked genuine distress.

Cornelius did not take the second chair. Instead, he spread his wings and launched himself directly onto the desk's surface, landing with deliberate precision in the exact center. His claws clicked against the polished wood as he settled, adjusting his position until he achieved optimal sight lines to all occupants.

Melas's eyebrow rose. "Making yourself comfortable?"

"I am establishing appropriate authority positioning. Given my physical stature, elevation is required to maintain proper interview dynamics." Cornelius arranged his book carefully beside him, spine aligned with the desk's edge. "Proceed with your questioning, Captain. I will observe and contribute as warranted."

"How generous of you." Melas pulled the mayor's chair around to the front of the desk and sat, placing himself at Cornelius's level but facing Valerian directly. He withdrew his notebook and pencil. "For the record, Valerian. Full name and occupation."

The Sphinx's throat worked as he swallowed. "Valerian. No family name. I am—I was—Signore Lucchesi's personal assistant."

"How long did you work for him?"

"Five years. Since he moved to Solterra Bay permanently."

Melas's pencil scratched across paper. Cornelius noted the captain's handwriting was surprisingly neat for someone who spent most of his time managing street patrols and bar fights. "Describe your duties."

"I managed his correspondence. Organized his research materials. Maintained his calendar. Coordinated with publishers, event organizers, and academic institutions." Valerian's ears flicked backward, then forward again in a nervous rhythm. "I also assisted with research for his current manuscript projects."

"Which projects specifically?"

"The *Meditations on Aetheric Resonance* series. He was working on volume four." Valerian's hands clenched together in his lap. "And various shorter works. Essays for academic journals. The occasional commissioned piece for civic events."

Cornelius's tail began moving in slow, analytical arcs. The Sphinx was providing information with careful precision, each answer complete but minimal. He was not volunteering additional context. This suggested either professional discretion or deliberate concealment.

"Tonight's speech," Melas continued. "Did you help prepare it?"

"I compiled the reference materials he requested. Historical documents on Solterra's artistic heritage. Citations for the theoretical framework he wanted to discuss." Valerian's breathing had accelerated slightly. "But the actual composition was his own work. He always wrote his public addresses personally."

"When did you last see him alive?"

"Approximately fifteen minutes before the speech began. He wanted privacy to review his notes and compose himself. I left him in the preparation room behind the platform."

"Was he alone when you left?"

"Yes."

"His behavior—was it normal? Did he seem anxious, ill, distressed?"

Valerian hesitated. The pause was brief but noticeable. "He seemed... tense. But that was typical before public appearances. Signore Lucchesi enjoyed being the center of attention, but he also felt the pressure of maintaining his reputation."

Cornelius leaned forward slightly. "His hands were shaking when he signed my book. Approximately twenty minutes before his death. Was that also typical?"

The Sphinx's gaze shifted to Cornelius, then away. "He had a tremor. It worsened when he was tired or stressed. He took medication for it, usually before major events."

"What medication?"

"I do not know the specific name. A powder he mixed with wine. His physician prescribed it."

"Did he take it tonight?"

"I—" Valerian stopped. His hands unclenched, then clenched again. "I assume so. He kept the medication in his personal effects. I did not observe him taking it directly."

Melas made another note. Cornelius's mind catalogued the information, cross-referencing it with the blue crystals he had found. Medication mixed with wine. The timing aligned too perfectly. If Lucchesi regularly consumed a powder dissolved in wine before public speeches, substituting that powder with Judgment Salt would be straightforward for anyone with access to his preparation routine.

"Who else knew about this medication?" Cornelius asked.

Valerian's ears flattened completely against his skull. "I—many people. His physician, certainly. Anyone who worked closely with him would have noticed the tremor."

"That was not my question. I asked who knew about the medication specifically. The timing of its use, the method of consumption, the routine surrounding it."

The Sphinx's breathing had become audible now, rapid and shallow. "His physician. Myself. Perhaps his housekeeper, though I cannot confirm that."

Cornelius's claws flexed against the desktop. Three people, by Valerian's accounting. A very small circle. Intimate knowledge.

"Let us discuss your relationship with Signore Lucchesi," Cornelius said. His voice remained level, academically neutral, but he watched Valerian's physical responses with absolute focus. "You worked for him for five years. That suggests either exceptional professional compatibility or significant financial dependency. Which was it?"

"I—both. Neither." Valerian's hands were shaking visibly now. "It was complicated."

"Elaborate."

"Signore Lucchesi was a brilliant scholar. Working with him provided access to research I could not have conducted independently. The position was prestigious. The compensation was adequate."

"That is a professional assessment. I asked about your relationship."

Valerian said nothing for several seconds. His golden eyes had gone very still, the kind of stillness that preceded either flight or violence. Then he exhaled slowly, his tufted ears drooping.

"I hated him," he said quietly.

The words fell into the room like stones into still water.

Melas stopped writing. Cornelius's tail went completely motionless.

"You hated him," the captain repeated. "Your employer. The man you worked for daily for five years."

"Yes."

"Why did you continue working for him?"

"Because I had no choice." Valerian's voice had shifted, losing its careful professional neutrality. Raw anger bled through now, controlled but present. "Signore Lucchesi was famous, respected, influential. I was his assistant. In the academic community, that relationship defined me. If I left without his recommendation, I would be unemployable in any comparable position. He knew that. He used it."

Cornelius felt a peculiar sensation in his chest—something that might have been recognition or might have been sympathy. He understood institutional power. He understood being trapped by the very structures one served.

"Used it how?" Melas asked.

"Credit. Recognition. Authorship." Valerian's hands unclenched, spreading flat against his thighs as if he were trying to ground himself. "The research I conducted for him—the citations I found, the frameworks I developed—they appeared in his publications under his name alone. Occasionally I would receive acknowledgment in a footnote. More often I received nothing."

"That is standard academic practice," Cornelius said, though he found the practice distasteful. "Research assistants provide support. Principal authors receive attribution."

"I was not a research assistant." Valerian's gaze locked onto Cornelius, and the dragon saw something cold and hard beneath the Sphinx's nervous exterior. "I wrote his last two books. Entirely. He provided outlines, concepts, general direction. I produced the actual manuscripts. The words, the arguments, the structure—all mine. Published under his name."

Ah.

Cornelius's mind recalibrated. Ghostwriting was not uncommon among popular authors who needed to produce content faster than their actual writing ability allowed. But it created complicated questions of ownership, credit, and recognition. Questions that could fester into genuine grievance.

"Did anyone else know about this arrangement?" Melas's pencil was moving again, taking rapid notes.

"No. Signore Lucchesi insisted on complete confidentiality. He said revealing the arrangement would damage both our reputations—his for not writing his own work, mine for being willing to sell my words. He said we were protecting each other."

"But you did not feel protected."

"I felt exploited." Valerian's voice cracked slightly. "My work. My research. My ideas. Published to great acclaim, reviewed in every major journal, discussed by scholars across three continents. And I received a salary and a footnote."

Cornelius's tail resumed its slow movement. The pattern was clarifying. Motive, certainly—years of accumulated resentment toward an employer who had systematically stolen intellectual credit. Access to Lucchesi's routines, including his medication schedule. Knowledge of rare alchemical compounds that a research-oriented Sphinx might plausibly have encountered in academic contexts.

The framework for murder was present. What remained was confirmation.

"Where were you when Signore Lucchesi collapsed?" Melas asked.

"Standing near the eastern colonnade. Perhaps fifteen feet from the platform."

"Did you see him drink from his glass?"

"Yes."

"Did you see anyone approach him immediately beforehand? Anyone who might have tampered with the wine?"

Valerian's breathing had become ragged. A fine sheen of moisture had appeared on his forehead despite the room's cool temperature. "No. I was not watching the platform continuously. I was—I was trying not to watch him at all."

"Because you hated him."

"Yes."

"Because he had stolen your work."

"Yes."

"Because you wanted him dead."

Valerian flinched as if struck. His ears flattened completely. His hands gripped the chair arms hard enough that his knuckles went pale beneath his fur.

And he sneezed.

It was a violent, explosive sneeze that shook his entire frame. He fumbled for a handkerchief, pressed it to his face, and sneezed again. Then a third time.

Cornelius's attention sharpened to absolute focus. Sphinx-kin sneezed when exposed to lies. Their physiology rejected falsehood with physical symptoms that could not be suppressed or hidden. It was one of the fundamental truths about their kind, as reliable as sunrise.

Valerian had just sneezed three times in immediate succession.

After denying that he wanted Lucchesi dead.

Melas had gone very still. His weathered face revealed nothing, but his gaze had shifted to Cornelius. A silent question passed between them.

Cornelius gave the smallest nod of confirmation. Yes. The sneeze was significant. Yes, it indicated deception.

The captain set down his pencil with deliberate care. "Valerian. Did you poison Fabrizio Lucchesi?"

The Sphinx's handkerchief was still pressed to his face. His golden eyes were wide above the fabric, pupils dilated. His entire body trembled.

"No," he said. The word was muffled by the handkerchief but distinct. "I did not kill him."

He sneezed again. Violently. Then once more.

Cornelius felt certainty settle into his mind like a well-organized index. The pattern was complete. The evidence aligned. Valerian had means—access to Lucchesi's medication routine. Motive—years of stolen credit and suppressed resentment. Opportunity—close proximity during the critical timeframe.

And now, when asked directly if he had committed murder, his own physiology betrayed him.

"I think we have sufficient grounds for formal detention," Cornelius said quietly. His voice carried absolute conviction. "The evidence is clear."

Melas nodded slowly. "Valerian, I am placing you under official Watch custody pending further investigation into the death of Fabrizio Lucchesi. You will be transferred to—"

"Wait."

The voice came from the corner where Zeph had positioned himself. The boy had been so quiet that Cornelius had almost forgotten his presence. Now Zeph pushed away from the wall, his expression troubled.

"Something is wrong," Zeph said.

Cornelius's tail twitched irritation. "The evidence is conclusive. Sphinx physiology does not lie."

"I know. But the timing was off." Zeph moved closer to the desk, his dark eyes focused on Valerian with uncomfortable intensity. "He sneezed after the first question, not the second one. Captain Melas asked if he wanted Lucchesi dead—sneeze. Then he asked if Valerian poisoned him—different question, same answer, also sneeze. That does not make sense."

Cornelius opened his mouth to dismiss the observation, then stopped.

Zeph was correct.

If Valerian's physiology reacted to lying about killing Lucchesi, it should have reacted specifically to that question. But the initial sneezing fit had occurred in response to denial about wanting the man dead. The second set of sneezes might have been continuation of the first reaction rather than response to the murder question specifically.

The pattern was not as clean as Cornelius had initially assessed.

"Valerian," Cornelius said carefully. "Did you want Fabrizio Lucchesi dead?"

The Sphinx lowered his handkerchief. His face was blotchy, his breathing still unsteady. He looked directly at Cornelius.

"No," he said.

He sneezed. Twice.

"Yes," he amended, his voice hoarse. "Sometimes. When I was angry, when he dismissed my work or humiliated me in front of publishers or took credit for ideas I had developed—yes. I wanted him dead. I fantasized about his death. I imagined how it might happen."

No sneeze.

Cornelius's certainty wavered slightly. Truth was more complicated than he had initially calibrated.

"But I did not kill him," Valerian continued. "I did not poison his wine. I did not tamper with his medication. I did not arrange his death in any way."

Sneeze. A single harsh explosion of breath.

"I wanted to survive him," Valerian said desperately. "I wanted to outlast him. I wanted to eventually escape and publish under my own name and have people finally know that I was the one who wrote those books. Death would have freed me from his employment, but it would not have given me that recognition. It would not have restored what he took."

His breathing was coming in gasps now. "I needed him alive long enough to either acknowledge my contribution or to make enough mistakes that people started questioning the quality of his later work. I needed evidence, documentation, some way to prove my authorship. His death destroys all of that. It makes him a martyr to scholarship and locks me into permanent anonymity."

He pressed the handkerchief to his face again, his shoulders shaking.

No sneeze this time.

Cornelius's mind recalibrated with uncomfortable speed. The logic was sound. An aggrieved ghostwriter would indeed have more to gain from eventual exposure than from murder. Death elevated Lucchesi's reputation. It sealed his published works as final testament. It eliminated any possibility of future acknowledgment.

If Valerian truly wanted credit for his intellectual work, killing Lucchesi was the worst possible strategy.

"But you were lying about something," Melas said. His voice had shifted to a different tone—not accusatory, but probing. "The sneezing indicates deception. What were you lying about?"

Valerian did not respond immediately. His hands twisted the handkerchief into tight spirals.

"Valerian," Cornelius said. His analytical mind was sorting through alternatives now, looking for patterns that explained the physical evidence without requiring murder. "What happened between you and Lucchesi that you do not want to reveal?"

The Sphinx's ears drooped until they nearly touched his shoulders. When he finally spoke, his voice was barely audible.

"We were lovers."

The words hung in the air.

Cornelius blinked. Melas's pencil went still.

"Three years ago," Valerian continued. "It lasted eight months. He ended it when he started courting someone else—someone with better connections, someone who could advance his social position. But we continued working together. Professional relationship maintained. Nothing acknowledged publicly."

He looked up, meeting Cornelius's gaze directly.

"So yes. I lied when I said I did not want him dead. Because part of me did want him dead—the part that remembered being discarded, being used, being reduced to convenient resource. But I also still..." He stopped. Started again. "It was complicated. My feelings were complicated. Hate and grief are not mutually exclusive."

Sneeze.

No. Wait.

Cornelius analyzed the timing more carefully. The sneeze had come during discussion of Valerian's feelings, not his actions. The Sphinx was lying about his emotions, not about facts. He was trying to simplify complicated truth into cleaner categories.

"You still loved him," Cornelius said quietly.

Valerian's eyes closed. "I do not know what I felt. I hated him. I resented him. I grieved what we might have been if he had been capable of seeing me as anything more than useful. All of that existed simultaneously." His voice cracked. "And now he is dead, and I will never have resolution for any of it."

The room was silent except for the faint scratching of Melas's pencil resuming its note-taking.

Cornelius's tail had gone completely still. He recognized the phenomenon Valerian described—the cognitive dissonance of holding contradictory truths about the same person. The human tendency to reduce complex relationships to simple narratives. Love or hate. Victim or villain. Reality was messier.

And messy reality did not lead to tidy convictions.

"Did you kill Fabrizio Lucchesi?" Melas asked again. His voice was gentle this time, almost kind.

"No." Valerian's answer was immediate and clear.

No sneeze.

"Do you know who did?"

"No."

No sneeze.

"Do you have any information that might help identify the killer?"

Valerian hesitated. "I know he had enemies. People who felt he had wronged them academically, professionally, personally. The list would be extensive."

"But no one specific comes to mind? No threats, no confrontations, nothing that seemed dangerous?"

"There was..." Valerian stopped. Considered. "Giovanni Conti confronted him two weeks ago. At the Library. I was not present for the entire conversation, but I heard shouting. Something about stolen research and academic fraud."

Cornelius's attention sharpened. "Giovanni was in the reception room. He admitted openly that he hated Lucchesi."

"Giovanni has hated Lucchesi for twenty years," Valerian said. "Their feud is academic legend. But he confronted him specifically two weeks ago, and the argument was more heated than usual."

Melas made a note. "I will follow up on that. Anyone else?"

"The Karellas family had some business arrangement with him. I do not know the details—Signore Lucchesi kept his financial arrangements private. But I know there were letters back and forth with their trade office, and he seemed anxious about maintaining that relationship."

More notes. "Anything else?"

Valerian shook his head slowly. Then stopped. "There was a woman. She came to the house three times in the last month. I never learned her name—Signore Lucchesi always met with her in his private study with the door closed. But she dressed like administrative staff, and she had ink stains on her hands."

Cornelius's mind immediately conjured the woman in gray from the reception room. Ink-stained fingers. Recent tears. Professional bearing.

"Describe her," Melas said.

"Forty, perhaps. Dark hair. Plain clothing, gray or brown, practical rather than fashionable. She always arrived in the early afternoon and stayed for perhaps an hour."

"Did Lucchesi seem concerned about these meetings?"

"He seemed... focused. Intent. Like the meetings mattered to him professionally." Valerian's ears twitched forward slightly. "But I do not know what they discussed."

Melas finished writing and closed his notebook. "Thank you, Valerian. You will still need to remain available for additional questioning, but you are not under arrest at this time."

The Sphinx's entire frame sagged with visible relief. "Thank you."

"You are free to return to the reception room. Please do not discuss this conversation with the other witnesses."

Valerian stood on unsteady legs and moved toward the door. He paused at the threshold, looking back at Cornelius.

"I did not kill him," he said quietly. "But I understand why you thought I might have. The evidence looks damning. I am sorry I could not provide clearer answers."

Then he was gone, the door closing softly behind him.

Cornelius remained on the desk, his mind processing the interview's outcomes. He had been certain. The pattern had seemed complete. And yet Zeph's observation about timing had unraveled that certainty, revealing a more complicated truth beneath.

"He is telling the truth," Melas said. It was not a question.

"Yes. About the murder, at least." Cornelius adjusted his spectacles. "Though his emotional state is genuinely chaotic. Complicated grief makes for unreliable affect."

"But not unreliable facts." Melas reopened his notebook to a fresh page. "So we are back to multiple suspects with motive and no clear mechanism for how the poison was administered."

"Not quite." Cornelius's tail began moving again, slower now, more contemplative. "We have new information. Giovanni Conti's recent confrontation. The Karellas family's business arrangement. The mysterious woman with ink-stained hands."

"Who is probably the woman currently sitting in the reception room."

"Almost certainly."

Zeph had remained silent during the exchange, but now he moved to stand beside the desk. His face was drawn, and Cornelius detected the faintest trace of ozone scent around him—stress response, manageable but present.

"You were right about the timing," Cornelius said to his intern. "Good catch."

Zeph's expression shifted slightly toward surprise. "You are admitting I was right?"

"I am acknowledging that your observation corrected my premature conclusion. That is not the same as admitting fault—I was working with incomplete information and provisional hypothesis. But yes. Your intervention prevented a significant investigative error."

"I will take it." Zeph rubbed his temples briefly, then stopped when he noticed Cornelius watching. "I am fine. Just tired."

"Noted." Cornelius turned back to Melas. "Who do you want to interview next?"

The captain consulted his notes. "Giovanni Conti seems like the logical choice. Recent confrontation, admitted hatred, knowledge of Judgment Salt."

"He also admitted all of that unprompted," Cornelius pointed out. "Which suggests either remarkable honesty or calculated misdirection."

"Or arrogance." Melas stood, tucking his notebook away. "Some people believe being obvious makes them less suspicious."

"Then let us test that theory." Cornelius gathered his book, tucking it securely under one forearm. "Bring in the bitter rival. I am curious to see whether his honesty extends to genuine cooperation or merely to dramatic confession."

Melas moved toward the door, then paused. "Master Drake. That was good work. Noticing the pattern with the sneezing."

"It was adequate work that drew a false conclusion," Cornelius corrected. "Zephyr's intervention made it good work."

"Still. You found physical evidence at the crime scene that my guards missed. You identified Judgment Salt from crystalline residue. You conducted a thorough interrogation that revealed significant context." Melas's weathered face shifted into something that might have been approval. "You are proving useful despite being deeply irritating."

"I will accept that as the highest compliment you are capable of offering."

"It is." Melas pulled open the door. "I will retrieve Conti. Try not to antagonize him so thoroughly that he refuses to answer questions."

"I make no promises."

The captain left. Cornelius remained on the desk, organizing his thoughts into clear categories. Suspects. Motives. Evidence. Connections.

The pattern was still there, waiting to be discovered.

He simply needed to look at it from the correct angle.
