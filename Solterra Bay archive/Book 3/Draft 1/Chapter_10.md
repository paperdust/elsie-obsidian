# Chapter 10

The Rotunda had been transformed into something approaching a proper tribunal, though Cornelius noted with private satisfaction that it lacked the formality of a true courtroom. Guards had arranged chairs in semicircular rows facing the platform where Lucchesi's shrouded body still lay. The positioning was deliberate—suspects and witnesses would be forced to look at the evidence of the crime while hearing the accusation.

Cornelius approved. Psychological pressure served investigation as surely as physical evidence.

He had positioned himself on one of the upper gallery columns, where his elevated vantage point would allow observation of every face, every reaction. His tail was wrapped neatly around his feet. His spectacles sat precisely centered on his snout. He had even straightened his bow tie twice to ensure maximum dignified effect.

Everything was arranged. The puzzle was solved. Now came the elegant demonstration.

Below, Captain Melas stood on the platform beside the covered corpse, his weathered face set in professional neutrality. He had agreed to lead the interrogation, but Cornelius knew who had constructed the logical framework. This was his theory. His deduction. His restoration of order to chaos.

The suspects filed in under guard supervision. Cornelius catalogued them with clinical precision.

Giovanni Conti entered first, his academic robes rumpled from hours of confinement. He moved with the irritated energy of someone who considered this entire proceeding beneath his dignity. He took a seat in the front row, crossing his arms.

Chloe Karellas and her mother Irene followed, the young siren's face pale but composed. They sat together, a unified family front that suggested careful coaching. Pavlos Karellas had been separated for additional questioning about his smuggling operation—a small tactical victory that pleased Cornelius's sense of order.

Other minor witnesses filled the remaining seats. The catering supervisor who had discovered the wall symbol. Several servers who had been on duty near the platform. A handful of civic officials who had attended the gala and remained trapped in the lockdown.

And finally, Valerian.

The Sphinx entered slowly, flanked by two guards who maintained careful distance. His leonine features were drawn, the fur around his muzzle looking somehow disheveled despite its natural texture. His hands—human in form despite his otherwise Sphinx body—trembled slightly as he took the seat indicated in the front row, directly facing the platform.

Directly facing Lucchesi's covered body.

Cornelius studied him with professional interest. Valerian looked exhausted. More than exhausted—hollowed out, as if the night had carved something fundamental from his center. His eyes kept drifting to the shrouded form, then jerking away as if the sight caused physical pain.

Guilt, Cornelius concluded. Unmistakable markers of conscience confronting consequence.

Movement at the back of the room drew his attention. Zeph had arrived, slouching against the curved wall near the entrance. Even at this distance, Cornelius could see the boy was unwell. His face was too pale, the shadows under his eyes pronounced even in the uncertain lamplight. He held himself with peculiar stillness, as if movement might shatter something fragile.

The ozone scent reached Cornelius's sensitive nose—faint but present. Another stress episode building.

Cornelius felt a flicker of concern, quickly suppressed. Zeph would endure. The boy was stronger than he credited himself. And once this matter was resolved, once order was restored, they could both rest.

First, the demonstration.

Melas raised one hand, commanding attention. The low murmur of conversation died instantly. Guards stationed at each exit stood at alert posture. The room settled into expectant silence.

"Thank you for your patience," Melas began. His voice carried clearly through the vast space, pitched for authority without aggression. "I know this has been a difficult night for everyone present. The death of Fabrizio Lucchesi was shocking and tragic. But I can now report that we have made significant progress in our investigation."

He paused, letting that settle. Cornelius approved of the pacing. Build anticipation. Allow observers to focus completely.

"We have identified the poison that killed Maestro Lucchesi," Melas continued. "And we have determined both the method of administration and the identity of the person responsible."

A ripple moved through the assembly—sharply indrawn breaths, slight shifts in posture. Cornelius watched faces carefully. Giovanni's expression remained skeptical. The Karellas women showed appropriate surprise but no particular alarm. Others registered varying degrees of shock and horrified fascination.

Valerian had gone completely still, his leonine body frozen in an attitude that might have been prayer or paralysis.

"The poison," Melas said, "was a rare alchemical compound known as Judgment Salt, or *Sal Judicium*. This substance has a unique property. It remains harmless to those without significant guilt. But for those who have committed serious wrongs—acts they themselves know to be morally or legally transgressive—it becomes a rapid and lethal poison."

More murmuring. Cornelius heard the word "guilt" repeated in whispers, saw understanding dawn on various faces. They were beginning to grasp the implication.

Lucchesi had been guilty of something serious enough to trigger the compound.

"This tells us several things about our killer," Melas continued. He had moved to stand directly beside the shrouded body, positioning himself as prosecutor beside the evidence. "First, they had access to extremely rare alchemical knowledge. Second, they chose this specific method for a reason—not simple assassination, but judgment. And third, they had intimate knowledge of Maestro Lucchesi's personal habits, particularly his medication routine."

Cornelius's tail twitched once. This was the foundation, the careful construction of context before the accusation. Well executed.

"Maestro Lucchesi," Melas said quietly, "regularly took a physician-prescribed powder mixed with wine before major public events. This was a private routine, known to very few people. His physician. His household staff. And his personal assistant."

Every eye in the room turned toward Valerian.

The Sphinx made a small sound—not quite speech, more a strangled exhalation. His hands gripped the edge of his seat with white-knuckled intensity.

"Valerian," Melas said, his tone shifting into formal accusation. "You had motive. Maestro Lucchesi exploited you professionally, claiming credit for your intellectual work. He betrayed you personally, ending your romantic relationship for reasons of social advantage while retaining you in a subservient professional position. You spent years watching him profit from your labor, receive acclaim for your writing, build a reputation on foundations you constructed."

Valerian was shaking his head slowly, a repetitive denial that looked almost involuntary.

Cornelius decided it was time to contribute his analysis. He spread his wings slightly, drawing attention to his elevated position.

"You also had means," he said, his voice cutting through the charged atmosphere with academic precision. "Through your work organizing Maestro Lucchesi's research materials, you encountered references to Judgment Salt. Perhaps in one of his rare alchemical texts. Perhaps in documents related to his early theoretical work on aetheric compounds. Regardless, you gained knowledge of a poison that would serve dual purpose—it would kill your target and psychologically justify the killing by proving the victim's guilt."

Valerian's leonine head turned upward, his eyes finding Cornelius on the column. The expression was difficult to parse—horror mixed with something that might have been desperate appeal.

"I did not—" he began, voice cracking.

"You had opportunity," Cornelius continued, overriding the protestation. "You prepared Maestro Lucchesi's schedule. You knew he would take his medication before the speech. You had access to his private preparation room. Replacing or adulterating the powder would have been simple for someone with your position and knowledge."

"No." Valerian's voice was stronger now, edged with desperation. "I hated him, yes. I wanted recognition. But I did not kill him. I would never—"

He sneezed violently. Once, twice, three times in rapid succession.

The room went utterly silent.

Cornelius felt satisfaction settle through his frame. There it was. The biological tell. Sphinxes could not lie without physical symptoms, and Valerian had just sneezed at the precise moment of denial.

"The evidence speaks clearly," Cornelius said. His voice carried the weight of certainty, the calm assurance of logic meeting proof. "Your body betrays the lie even as you speak it. You killed Fabrizio Lucchesi using Judgment Salt administered through his medication. You created the theatrical wall symbol to misdirect investigation toward imagined zealots. And now you sit before us attempting denial while your own physiology contradicts you."

Valerian was weeping. Tears streamed down his leonine face, matting the fur. His breathing came in ragged gasps that might have been the prelude to sobs or screams.

"I did not kill him," he repeated. His voice broke completely. "I hated him. I wanted him to suffer as I suffered. But I did not want him dead. I needed him alive—alive long enough to force him to acknowledge what I had done, to prove to the world that those books were mine. His death accomplishes nothing. It leaves me forever invisible."

Another sneeze punctuated the declaration.

Cornelius's analytical mind registered the timing, cross-referenced it with the content of Valerian's statement. The sneeze had occurred after the emotional claim about needing Lucchesi alive, not after the factual denial of murder.

A small inconsistency. But emotions were often tangled, self-deceptive. Valerian might genuinely believe his rationalizations while still having committed the act. Murderers frequently constructed elaborate psychological justifications.

The theory held. The logic was sound.

Valerian reached for something on the small table beside his chair—Cornelius's enhanced vision identified it as a glass of water, probably provided by guards for the witnesses' comfort during the long night. The Sphinx's hands shook so badly that water sloshed against the sides as he lifted it.

From the back of the room, a sharp sound—halfway between gasp and cry.

Cornelius's attention snapped toward the source.

Zeph had pushed away from the wall. His face was no longer merely pale but bone-white, slicked with sudden sweat. One hand pressed against his temple. His eyes were wide, pupils dilated to the point that they looked almost black.

The ozone scent hit Cornelius like a physical force. Not the faint background presence from before, but overwhelming atmospheric charge—the electrical density that preceded lightning strikes.

"Don't!" Zeph shouted. The word tore from him with desperate urgency. "Valerian, don't drink that!"

But the warning came one second too late.

Valerian had already raised the glass to his lips. Already tilted it back. Already swallowed.

For a frozen moment, nothing happened.

Valerian lowered the glass slowly, confusion replacing terror on his leonine features. He looked at Zeph, then at the glass, then opened his mouth as if to ask a question.

The convulsion hit him like a physical blow.

His entire body went rigid. The glass fell from spasming hands, shattering against marble with crystalline precision. Valerian's mouth opened in a soundless scream, foam already bubbling at the corners. His leonine form jerked backward against the chair with such force that it tipped, spilling him onto the floor.

Someone screamed. Multiple someones. The assembly erupted into chaos—people surging to their feet, guards shouting for order, Melas vaulting from the platform toward the seizing Sphinx.

Cornelius remained frozen on his column perch, wings half-spread in an aborted motion toward flight.

His mind processed with terrible clarity:

The reaction was identical to Lucchesi's death. Same onset speed. Same convulsive pattern. Same foam at the mouth indicating respiratory collapse.

Judgment Salt.

In the water glass.

Prepared and positioned before the assembly. Before the accusation. Before anyone knew Valerian would be sitting in that specific seat.

The logical implications cascaded through Cornelius's thoughts with mechanical inevitability:

If Valerian was poisoned, Valerian was not the poisoner.

If Valerian was a target, Valerian was not the killer.

If Valerian was dying the same way Lucchesi died, then someone else had administered Judgment Salt to both of them.

And if Judgment Salt only killed the guilty, then Valerian—whatever his other crimes of exploitation or ghostwriting—had been telling the truth about not committing murder.

All of which meant Cornelius's perfect theory was catastrophically, mortally wrong.

Melas had reached Valerian's collapsed form, was shouting for the healer, attempting to position the convulsing body for treatment. Imelda appeared from somewhere, her ancient face set in grim lines as she knelt beside the Sphinx. Other guards were trying to restore order, to prevent the panicked assembly from stampeding toward the exits.

Cornelius could not move. His claws gripped the column with rigid force. His wings remained half-extended in useless paralysis.

He had been so certain. Ninety percent probability. The evidence had aligned so perfectly. The motive clear. The means established. The opportunity confirmed. And the Sphinx sneeze—biological proof of deception.

All of it meaningless. All of it worse than meaningless—it had been misdirection that he had accepted blindly, constructed elaborate logic to support, and then announced with absolute authority in front of everyone.

He had accused an innocent person. Had assembled the court, delivered the condemnation, ignored the warnings.

Had ignored Zeph's warning specifically. The boy who said Valerian seemed "scared of something bigger." Who questioned why theatrical demonstration was necessary. Who expressed clear doubt even while deferring to Cornelius's supposed expertise.

Movement at the back of the room registered peripherally. Zeph had sagged against the wall, his face buried in both hands. His shoulders shook—whether from sobs or simply physical collapse from the sensory overload, Cornelius could not determine.

On the floor, Valerian's convulsions were slowing. Not improvement—the terrible stillness of systems shutting down. Imelda's expression confirmed what Cornelius's analytical mind had already concluded.

Another death. Another victim of Judgment Salt.

Which meant another guilty party. Someone else who had committed acts serious enough to trigger the compound's lethal properties.

And it meant the actual killer was still here. Still in this room. Still one step ahead of the investigation.

Still ahead of Cornelius.

The thought felt like physical pain—a sensation he had not experienced since his manifestation from the library's accumulated knowledge. His analytical mind, his pattern recognition, his logical deduction—all the tools he trusted absolutely, that defined his fundamental nature—had failed.

Worse than failed. Had been manipulated. Used against the investigation like a weapon the killer had placed in his claws and aimed at an innocent target.

The killer who was currently watching with satisfaction as chaos consumed the Rotunda. Who had predicted or hoped for exactly this outcome. Who had prepared the poisoned water glass and waited for the trap to spring.

Cornelius forced himself to scan the assembly. Every face was turned toward Valerian's dying form and the cluster of people attempting futile aid. Expressions of shock, horror, fear. No obvious satisfaction. No visible triumph.

But the killer was here. Had to be. Had positioned the glass. Had known or predicted that Valerian would be accused. Had prepared for this specific scenario.

The perfect crime compounded. First Lucchesi, now Valerian. Both guilty of something, both killed by a poison that only confirmed their guilt while making the actual murderer appear righteous.

And Cornelius had helped. Had constructed the very accusation that drove Valerian to reach for the poisoned water. Had assembled the witnesses, created the psychological pressure, forced the sequence of events that led inexorably to this moment.

He had not killed Valerian with his own claws. But his certainty, his arrogance, his absolute conviction in his own intellectual superiority—those had been the weapons that maneuvered the Sphinx into position for execution.

Melas straightened from Valerian's still form. The captain's weathered face looked older suddenly, carved with lines of exhaustion and grim recognition. His gaze swept the assembly, then rose to find Cornelius on his column perch.

Their eyes met across the chaotic space.

Cornelius saw the question forming. Saw Melas's professional mind already pivoting to next steps, new theories, revised approach. The captain would not waste time on recrimination—there was still a killer to catch, still an investigation requiring resolution.

But Cornelius could not move. Could not speak. Could not formulate response or contribute observation or construct hypothesis.

His perfect order had collapsed into chaos. His restoration of truth had cemented lies. His absolute certainty had killed an innocent person.

And somewhere in this locked building, the actual Judge was watching his failure unfold with satisfaction that Cornelius could only imagine but could not, despite all his vaunted analytical power, identify or prevent.
