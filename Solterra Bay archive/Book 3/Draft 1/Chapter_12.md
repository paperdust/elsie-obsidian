# Chapter 12

The corridors beyond the Rotunda blurred together. Zeph kept one hand against the wall as he walked, letting cool stone guide him through the maze of City Hall's service passages. His headache had faded to a dull throb behind his left eye—not gone, never really gone these days, but manageable if he didn't think too hard about it.

He'd left the chaos behind. The guards shouting orders. The witnesses crying or demanding answers. Captain Melas trying to restore some kind of order while Valerian was carried off on a stretcher, still breathing but barely.

Zeph had tried to warn him. Had felt that horrible electric buildup in his skull, that certainty that something was about to go very, very wrong. And he'd been too late. Again.

The story of his whole stupid night.

His legs felt like they belonged to someone else. Each step required conscious effort, as if he'd forgotten how walking worked and had to reinvent it from scratch. The ozone smell was gone now—it always faded after the worst passed—but he could still taste metal at the back of his throat.

He needed to find Sophia. Needed to explain why he'd shouted like that, why he'd been standing at the back instead of sitting with her, why he looked half-dead and probably smelled like he'd been struck by lightning.

Needed to explain the unexplainable, basically.

Great plan.

The service corridor opened into a wider hallway—still utilitarian, still bare stone and exposed beams, but with higher ceilings. A few oil lamps flickered in wall sconces, casting more shadow than light. Zeph's footsteps echoed against the floor.

Movement ahead made him stop.

Sophia stood near a recessed doorway, her dark hair escaping its careful arrangement, her formal dress looking wilted despite the expensive fabric. She had her arms wrapped around herself, shoulders hunched in a way that made her look smaller than usual.

When she heard his footsteps, her head jerked up. Her expression cycled through relief, anger, and exhaustion in the space of a breath.

"Zeph." Her voice was flat. Not the warm greeting he'd hoped for. Not even the sharp anger he'd expected. Just... tired.

"Hey." He stopped a few feet away, suddenly unsure if he should close the distance. "I was looking for you."

"Were you." Not a question. She pressed one hand to her forehead, fingers massaging her temple. "Or were you looking for somewhere quiet to have another headache?"

The words stung more than they should have. Probably because they were fair.

"That's not—" He swallowed. Tried again. "I wanted to make sure you were okay. After everything that happened in there."

"After the tribunal fell apart? After someone nearly died in front of everyone?" Sophia's laugh had no humor in it. "After you screamed at a suspect not to drink water and somehow turned out to be right?"

"I didn't—" Zeph's head throbbed. He winced, hated himself for wincing. "I just knew something was wrong. I can't explain how, but—"

"You never can." Sophia dropped her hand, and he saw how red her eyes were. She'd been crying. Recently. "Explain, I mean. It's always 'I don't know' or 'I can't help it' or 'it just happens.' Do you have any idea how that sounds?"

"Like I'm making excuses." His voice came out quieter than intended.

"Like you're not even trying." She moved away from the wall, her formal shoes clicking against stone. "I spent three hours tonight explaining to my mother why you disappeared from our introduction. Three hours, Zeph. And that was before the murder and the chaos and everything else. Before you screamed in the middle of a formal tribunal and somehow saved someone's life while looking like you were about to pass out."

Zeph's hands clenched at his sides. "I didn't ask to—"

"To what? To ruin every important moment we have together?" Sophia's composure cracked, voice rising. "Because that's the pattern, isn't it? Every time something matters—really matters—you have a headache. Or you need air. Or you disappear to the washroom and don't come back for an hour."

"That's not fair."

"Fair?" She stared at him. "You know what my mother said after you ran off? She said I shouldn't waste time on someone who clearly doesn't value our family enough to endure a ten-minute conversation. And my father—he didn't even look at me for the rest of the night. Just sat there with that disappointed expression, like I'd brought home a stray dog that wouldn't stop tracking mud through the house."

The comparison hit like a fist. Zeph felt his face heat, shame and anger mixing in his chest.

"I'm not a dog," he said.

"I know that." Sophia's voice cracked. "But they don't. They see a library intern who can't hold a basic conversation, who makes their daughter look foolish for caring about him, who shows up to formal events and then vanishes at the first sign of pressure."

"It's not pressure, it's—" How could he explain? The way crowds made his skin feel too tight? The way loud voices scraped against the inside of his skull? The electric buildup that meant danger was coming, that someone was about to get hurt, that he needed to pay attention right now or people would die?

He couldn't. Because he didn't understand it himself.

"It's what?" Sophia asked. "A medical condition that no healer can find? A sensitivity that only affects you at the worst possible times? Or is it just that you don't want to be there?"

"Of course I want to be there." The words burst out before he could stop them. "I wore that stupid formal jacket. I memorized facts about your family's mosaics. I practiced what to say a dozen times with Cornelius. I tried, Sophia. I really tried."

"I know." Her shoulders sagged. "That's the worst part. I know you try. But trying isn't enough when you physically cannot function in the spaces I need you to function in."

The corridor felt colder suddenly. Zeph wrapped his arms around himself, mirroring Sophia's defensive posture.

"So what are you saying?" he asked.

Sophia looked at him. Really looked, like she was trying to memorize his features. When she spoke again, her voice was soft. Gentle. Which somehow made it worse.

"I'm saying that I'm exhausted. I'm saying that I spent tonight being questioned by the City Watch about a murder I didn't commit, watching you save someone's life in the most dramatic way possible, and then explaining to my parents—again—why the boy I'm dating is currently helping investigate a crime instead of sitting beside me like a normal partner would."

"I didn't—"

"Choose to help investigate. I know." She held up one hand. "But you did anyway. Because that's what you do. When there's a mystery or a puzzle or something that needs your specific kind of attention, you're there. You're focused. You're competent. You're not the person who needs to leave every ten minutes."

Zeph's throat felt tight. "Are you saying I care more about books than I do about you?"

"No." Sophia shook her head. "I'm saying you do better with books than you do with people. Including me. And I don't know if that's something that can change, or if I'm asking you to be someone you're not."

The admission hung between them. Zeph wanted to argue. Wanted to promise he could change, could be better, could learn to handle her world if she just gave him more time.

But the words stuck.

Because she was right. He'd been miserable from the moment he'd arrived at the gala. Had spent the entire night fighting headaches and crowd-induced panic and the constant fear that he'd say something wrong. The only time he'd felt remotely useful was when he'd been analyzing evidence with Cornelius. When he'd been using his brain instead of trying to make small talk about tile patterns and shipping contracts.

"I don't fit," he said finally. "In your world. With the Tile Families and the formal dinners and the politics. I don't fit, and I don't know if I ever will."

Sophia's eyes welled up. She blinked hard, forcing the tears back.

"I know," she whispered.

The confirmation hurt worse than any accusation.

"My mother wants to postpone introducing you to the extended family," Sophia continued. Her voice had gone flat again, like she was reciting facts for a particularly unpleasant report. "Indefinitely. Until you're more... stable."

"Stable." The word tasted bitter.

"Her word, not mine." Sophia twisted her hands together. "But Zeph, she's not entirely wrong. You need to figure out what's happening with you. These headaches, the sensitivity, whatever it is that makes you shut down in certain situations—you need answers. Real answers. Not just 'I don't know' and hoping it gets better."

"And until then?"

Sophia closed her eyes. When she opened them again, they were dry but devastated.

"Until then, I think we need space. Both of us. I need to deal with my family and the fallout from tonight. You need to deal with... whatever's happening with you. And we need to stop pretending that trying harder will magically fix this."

Space. The word hung in the air like a death sentence dressed up as a temporary solution.

"Is this a breakup?" Zeph asked. His voice sounded distant to his own ears.

"I don't know." Sophia's composure finally shattered. One tear escaped, tracking down her cheek. "I don't want it to be. But I can't keep doing this. Defending you to my family while not understanding what I'm defending. Watching you suffer at events that should be enjoyable. Feeling like a liability—"

She stopped. The word had slipped out accidentally, Zeph could tell. But it was out now, floating between them.

Liability.

The same word Captain Melas had probably used for Cornelius. The same concept that Sophia's parents clearly held about Zeph. The fundamental truth that he made things harder, not easier. That his presence caused problems instead of solving them.

He was a liability. To Sophia's family. To Sophia's reputation. Maybe even to Sophia herself.

The headache pulsed behind his eye, a dull reminder of all the ways his body betrayed him at the worst moments.

"Okay," he said.

Sophia blinked. "Okay?"

"You're right. You need space. I need..." What? Answers he didn't have? A different body that didn't fall apart under pressure? A personality that fit better with tile mosaics and formal dinners? "To figure things out. So let's do that."

"Zeph—"

"No, it's fine." He took a step backward. The distance felt important suddenly. Like if he stayed too close, he'd say something he'd regret. Or worse, he'd try to talk her out of this when she was clearly, painfully right about everything. "You should get back to your family. They're probably wondering where you are."

"What about you?"

"I'll figure it out." Another step back. His heel hit the wall behind him. "I'm good at figuring things out. Just not the social stuff, apparently."

Sophia's face crumpled. "I don't want to hurt you."

"I know." And he did. That was the worst part. She wasn't being cruel. She was being honest. Which hurt so much more. "But this hurts anyway. So maybe just... let me go. Before we say anything else we can't take back."

She nodded. Wrapped her arms tighter around herself. Looked like she wanted to say something more but couldn't find the words.

Zeph turned and walked away before she could try.

His legs moved on autopilot, carrying him deeper into the service corridors. Away from the Rotunda. Away from Sophia. Away from the disaster that tonight had become.

The voices in his head were loud now. All the things he should have said. All the ways he could have defended himself better. All the promises he could have made about trying harder, being better, figuring out the headache situation once and for all.

But none of it would have mattered. Because Sophia was right. He didn't fit. Couldn't fit. Wouldn't fit no matter how many facts he memorized or how many formal jackets he wore.

He was a library intern who ate noodles from questionable street vendors and got electric headaches before people got poisoned. Not exactly Tile Family son-in-law material.

The corridor opened into a junction with three possible directions. Zeph stopped, suddenly unsure where he was going. The service exit was... left? Or was it straight ahead?

Did it matter? He could just leave. Walk out whatever door led outside. Go back to his tiny rented room above the bakery. Sleep for twelve hours and then decide if he was going to quit the internship or just pretend tonight never happened.

Quitting seemed easier. Cleaner. He could find work somewhere else. Somewhere that didn't involve murder investigations and Tile Family politics and dragons who expected him to be useful when he clearly wasn't.

Somewhere he could be a liability in peace.

The thought should have been comforting. Freedom from expectations. From constant failure. From watching people look at him with disappointment or pity or thinly veiled contempt.

Instead it just felt hollow.

Zeph chose the left corridor. His footsteps echoed against stone, the only sound in the empty passage. The oil lamps were spaced farther apart here, leaving pools of shadow between circles of dim light.

He turned a corner and stopped.

There was a bench built into an alcove. Simple stone, probably meant for guards to rest between shifts. And sitting on that bench, looking smaller than Zeph had ever seen him, was Cornelius.

The dragon wasn't perched. Wasn't posed with wings arranged for maximum dignified effect. Wasn't even wearing his usual expression of haughty academic superiority.

He just sat. Slumped, actually, with his wings hanging loose and his tail curled limply beside him. His spectacles sat crooked on his snout, like he'd put them on without his usual careful precision. The bow tie was rumpled.

He looked like a prop that had been used for a play and then discarded in the backstage area. Forgotten. Unwanted.

The word came back, unbidden. Liability.

Captain Melas had kicked Cornelius off the investigation. Zeph had been there for part of it, had heard the anger in the captain's voice. Had seen the way Cornelius went absolutely still, the way his wings froze mid-spread.

The dragon had been wrong. Catastrophically wrong. And someone had nearly died because of it.

But Cornelius had been trying to help. Had been using all his knowledge and logic and pattern-recognition to solve the puzzle. Had genuinely believed he was restoring order.

He'd just been wrong.

Like Zeph had been wrong to think he could function at a formal gala. Like he'd been wrong to think memorizing facts about mosaics would make him fit into Sophia's world. Like he'd been wrong about a lot of things tonight.

Two liabilities, Zeph thought. One tiny dragon who loved being right more than being careful. One headache-prone intern who couldn't handle an introduction to his girlfriend's parents.

Ex-girlfriend's parents, probably.

Zeph stood at the edge of the lamplight, watching Cornelius sit in miserable silence. He could keep walking. Could head for that exit. Could leave City Hall and the investigation and all of it behind.

Could let the dragon sit alone in the dark, processing his failure without witnesses.

But the thing was, Zeph knew what that felt like. The sitting alone part. The processing failure part. The being a liability part.

And it sucked.

He stepped into the alcove. His footsteps announced his presence, but Cornelius didn't look up.

"Hey," Zeph said.

Cornelius's tail twitched. A barely-there acknowledgment.

Zeph sat down on the bench. The stone was cold through his formal pants. He leaned back against the wall, matching Cornelius's slumped posture.

"Captain Melas is an ass," he said finally.

That got a reaction. Cornelius's head turned slightly, one golden eye visible behind crooked spectacles.

"Captain Melas is correct," the dragon said. His voice was quiet. None of the usual precise enunciation. "My certainty resulted in harm. My methods proved dangerous. I am—" He stopped. Started again. "I was wrong."

"Yeah." Zeph didn't see the point in arguing. "But you were trying to help."

"Intention does not mitigate consequence."

"Maybe not. But it should count for something." Zeph rubbed his face with both hands, exhaustion hitting him in waves. "Sophia just told me I'm basically too broken to meet her extended family. Said I need to figure out what's wrong with me before we can keep dating. Which is basically a breakup with extra steps."

Cornelius was quiet for a moment. Then, "I am sorry."

"Yeah, well. She's not wrong either." The admission hurt, but it was true. "I can't function at those events. I tried, and I failed, and honestly I don't know if I can ever be what she needs."

Another silence. Somewhere in the distance, voices echoed. The investigation continuing without them.

"I was considering returning to the Library permanently," Cornelius said. His tail curled tighter. "Restricting myself to archival work. Declining future investigative consultations. I am evidently not suited for fieldwork."

Zeph thought about that. About Cornelius permanently hidden in the Library stacks. About himself finding some different job, maybe in a different city entirely. Both of them retreating from the world because the world had made it clear they didn't quite fit.

It would be easier. Safer. Less painful than constantly trying and failing.

But it also felt like giving up.

"Or," Zeph said slowly, "we could accept that we're both kind of a mess and keep going anyway."

Cornelius's head tilted, curiosity breaking through dejection. "Explain your reasoning."

"I don't have reasoning. I have spite." Zeph leaned his head back against the wall, staring at the stone ceiling. "Sophia called me a liability. Melas probably called you one too. And they're both right, technically. But screw that. I don't want to be the guy who quits because things got hard."

"You are suggesting we continue despite demonstrated incompetence?"

"I'm suggesting that two liabilities are better than one." Zeph looked at the dragon. "You know stuff I don't. I see stuff you don't. Yeah, we both screwed up tonight. But we also helped. You figured out the Judgment Salt thing. I warned Valerian before he could drink enough to die. That's not nothing."

Cornelius adjusted his spectacles with one claw, a ghost of his usual fastidious gesture. "The investigation proceeded adequately before my involvement. Captain Melas is competent."

"Captain Melas is tired and overworked and dealing with politics we don't have to deal with." Zeph felt something solidifying in his chest. Not quite hope. Not yet. But maybe the foundation for it. "There's still a killer in this building. And yeah, you got the Valerian thing wrong. But you were right about the Judgment Salt. Right about it being calculated. Right about a lot of stuff."

"Being partially correct is insufficient when the error results in near-fatal consequences."

"Okay, but sitting here feeling sorry for yourself is also insufficient." Zeph stood up. His legs protested, exhausted and sore. "Look, I don't know if we can actually help. Maybe we're both just liability-prone disasters who should stick to books and avoid people. But we're here. We know stuff. And I'm pretty sure Captain Melas doesn't have anyone who can taste the air before something goes wrong."

That was the first time he'd said it out loud. The thing he couldn't explain to Sophia or healers or anyone else. The knowing.

Cornelius looked at him with both eyes now, analytical focus returning to his features.

"You warned Valerian before you could have logically known the water was poisoned," he said carefully.

"Yeah."

"And you have experienced similar... premonitions before. The headaches. The ozone scent. The physical symptoms that precede incidents."

"Yeah." Zeph's face heated. "I know it sounds crazy—"

"It sounds diagnostic." Cornelius straightened on the bench, wings shifting into their usual precise position. "We should document the pattern. Cross-reference with known magical conditions. There may be literature on precognitive sensitivity or danger-sensing abilities."

"Or I'm just weird and broken."

"Those categories are not mutually exclusive." But Cornelius's voice had lost its hollowness. He was thinking again. Puzzling. Being himself. "However, 'broken' implies malfunction. Perhaps your condition is simply unidentified functionality."

Zeph felt something unknot in his chest. Not quite hope. Not yet. But something.

"So we're doing this?" he asked. "Staying? Helping?"

Cornelius was quiet for a moment. Then he spread his wings, shook himself once, and straightened his bow tie with careful precision.

"Captain Melas removed me from official involvement," he said. "He said nothing about independent observation."

"Pretty sure he meant for you to go home."

"I am aware of what he meant. However, I am also aware that his investigation would benefit from analysis he currently lacks." Cornelius's tail swished once. "And you are correct. Two liabilities may prove more useful than one."

Zeph grinned despite everything. "You just quoted me. That's basically admitting I was right about something."

"I admitted no such thing. I merely acknowledged the pragmatic value of continued collaboration." But there was something in Cornelius's tone that might have been humor. "Now. Where is the nearest access to City Hall's records storage? If we are to investigate independently, we will require documentation."

"You're going to break into the records room?"

"I am going to conduct research in municipal archives that are technically accessible to Library personnel." Cornelius launched from the bench, gliding to Zeph's shoulder. His weight was substantial but somehow comforting. "That is entirely different from breaking in."

"If you say so." Zeph started walking back the way he'd come. Away from the exit. Back toward the heart of City Hall and the investigation and all the complicated disaster the night had become.

Sophia was right about him. Cornelius was a mess. Melas probably should have kicked them both out.

But they were here. They knew things. And maybe that was enough.

Or maybe they'd fail again. Maybe Zeph would get another headache at exactly the wrong moment. Maybe Cornelius would construct another perfect theory that turned out to be perfectly wrong.

But at least they wouldn't fail alone.

"For the record," Cornelius said from his shoulder perch, "your warning did save Valerian's life. Partial success is still preferable to complete failure."

"You're just saying that because you feel guilty."

"I am saying it because it is accurate." The dragon's weight shifted as he adjusted his position. "Though I do also feel considerable guilt. Both things can be true simultaneously."

Zeph navigated another turn, heading toward where he thought the records storage was located. "So what's the plan? We find proof of who did it and hand it to Melas?"

"We gather information. We observe. We document." Cornelius's claws gripped Zeph's shoulder carefully, not quite tight enough to hurt. "And we do not announce conclusions until we are considerably more than ninety percent certain."

"That's pretty much the opposite of your usual approach."

"Yes. Well." The dragon's voice went quiet again. "Perhaps it is time I revised my methodology."

They walked through the dim corridors together. Two liabilities. One tiny dragon and one headache-prone intern. Heading back toward the investigation that had already gone wrong so many times.

But heading back anyway.

Because maybe that was what mattered. Not being perfect. Not fitting in. Not even being right.

Just showing up and trying again.

Even when it hurt.
