# Chapter 13

Footsteps echoed from the junction ahead. Measured. Heavy. The distinctive rhythm of someone who had walked too many corridors in too many bad situations.

Cornelius recognized Captain Melas before the man fully entered the lamplight. His weathered features looked worse than they had in the Mayor's office—darker shadows under his eyes, deeper lines bracketing his mouth. His uniform jacket hung open, revealing ink stains on his shirt where his pocket had leaked.

The captain stopped at the bench. Looked down at both of them. His expression was unreadable.

"Still here," he said.

It was not quite an accusation. Not quite a question. Cornelius could not determine which would have been preferable.

"Yes," Cornelius said. The word emerged small. Insufficient. He cleared his throat and tried again. "We were... discussing next steps."

"Were you." Melas pulled a wooden chair from the wall—one of several scattered alcove furniture pieces meant for guard rest periods—and sat down with the careful movements of someone whose joints protested every shift in position. "And what steps did you conclude were appropriate after being removed from an active investigation?"

Zeph shifted beside Cornelius. The bench creaked. "We were thinking about going to the records storage. To research."

"Research what, exactly?"

"Magical conditions that present as precognitive sensitivity," Cornelius said. His tail curled tighter against the stone. "Zeph's warning about the poisoned water was not random. There is a pattern to his episodes. One that warrants formal documentation and cross-reference."

"That is what you are researching." Melas's tone suggested profound skepticism. "The intern's headaches. Not the murder investigation I explicitly told you to leave alone."

"The two subjects may be related," Cornelius said. "If Zeph possesses some form of danger-sensing ability, understanding its parameters could prove relevant to—"

"No." Melas held up one hand. "Stop. I do not have energy for parsing your justifications right now."

Silence settled over the alcove. Somewhere distant, a door slammed. Voices rose and faded. The investigation continuing without them.

"How is Valerian?" Zeph asked quietly.

"Stable. Unconscious. Imelda says he should wake within a few hours, barring complications." Melas rubbed his face with both hands. "At which point I will question him about what he is actually guilty of, since the Judgment Salt proved he carries serious transgression even if he did not kill Lucchesi."

"You are still planning to file charges," Cornelius said.

"I am planning to do my job. Which includes detaining suspects who demonstrate clear evidence of criminality." Melas dropped his hands. "The warrants will be ready within the hour. Attempted suicide by poison. Conspiracy to commit murder pending further investigation. Obstruction of justice if I can make it stick."

"But he is innocent." The words burst out before Cornelius could evaluate their strategic value. "Of this murder. The Salt proved—"

"The Salt proved he is guilty of something serious enough to nearly kill him." Melas's voice remained level. Dangerously level. "That is sufficient legal ground for detention while we determine what that something is. And it gives the Mayor an answer she can present to the Tile Families and the press and everyone else demanding we restore order."

"An answer built on partial truth," Cornelius said.

"Better than no answer built on catastrophic error." Melas stood. His chair scraped against stone. "I am not arguing this with you again, Drake. The decision is made. The paperwork is being prepared. You have one hour before everything becomes official and permanent."

Cornelius's claws scraped against the bench. "One hour to do what?"

"Whatever you want. Go home. Conduct your research into magical headaches. Fly to the harbor and watch ships if that brings you comfort." Melas's weathered face was exhausted. "Just stay out of the official investigation. I have witnesses to re-interview, evidence to catalogue, and approximately six different political pressures to navigate. I cannot also manage a disgraced dragon who thinks theory is more important than procedure."

The words should have stung. Would have stung, an hour ago.

Now they just felt accurate.

"Captain." Zeph's voice was careful. "What happens after the hour?"

"The warrants are filed. Valerian remains in custody. The investigation continues along proper channels." Melas moved toward the corridor. "And you two go back to being librarian and intern instead of playing detective."

"We were not playing," Cornelius said.

Melas stopped. Turned. Something in his expression softened slightly. Not forgiveness. Not even approval. Just weariness.

"I know you were trying to help," he said. "I know your intentions were good. But intentions do not undo harm, Drake. Remember that before you insert yourself into another situation that requires more caution than cleverness."

He walked away. His footsteps faded down the corridor until only silence and lamplight remained.

Cornelius sat very still. His wings felt heavy. His spectacles needed adjustment but he could not summon the energy to fix them.

One hour. Sixty minutes before everything became permanent. Before Valerian was officially charged with crimes that served political necessity more than actual justice. Before the investigation sealed around a convenient answer that satisfied procedure while ignoring truth.

Before Cornelius's greatest failure was immortalized in legal documentation.

"We should go," he said. "To the Library. You need rest. I need to... process."

"Process what?" Zeph asked.

"My removal from future investigative consultation. My demonstrated incapacity for field work. The fundamental flaws in my methodology that nearly resulted in—" His throat closed. He could not finish the sentence.

"In you being wrong about something." Zeph's tone was matter-of-fact. "Yeah. That happened. You were catastrophically wrong. We established that already."

"Your point?"

"My point is sitting here feeling bad about it does not actually help anyone." Zeph shifted on the bench, turning to face Cornelius more directly. "You have one hour. Melas basically gave you permission to keep poking at this as long as you stay out of his way. So poke."

"To what end? I have already demonstrated that my deductions are—"

"Sometimes wrong. Yeah. Like I said, we established that." Zeph leaned forward, elbows on knees. "But you were not wrong about everything. The Judgment Salt. The method of administration. The fact that someone smart is running this whole thing. You got a lot of stuff right. You just got the wrong person."

"An error that nearly proved fatal."

"But did not. Because I warned him in time. Because Imelda is good at healing. Because we got lucky." Zeph's dark eyes were serious. "And yeah, luck is not methodology. I know you hate that. But maybe the problem was not your logic. Maybe it was just... incomplete data."

Cornelius wanted to argue. Wanted to explain that incomplete data was precisely the issue, that certainty required comprehensive evidence, that his failure represented fundamental flaws in—

"The Salt did not kill Valerian," Zeph said.

The non sequitur broke Cornelius's spiral of self-recrimination. He blinked. "What?"

"The Judgment Salt. It did not kill him. He survived." Zeph's hands moved as he talked, gesturing in the way he did when working through problems aloud. "Imelda said it only kills people who are genuinely guilty. Guilty of serious stuff. Real crimes or moral whatever."

"Yes. We established that Valerian carries guilt for something, even if not for Lucchesi's murder."

"Okay, but here is the weird part." Zeph's brow furrowed. "When I was watching him during the tribunal? He felt greasy."

"Greasy." Cornelius adjusted his spectacles with one claw. "Please clarify."

"Like... dishonest. Slippery. The way people feel when they are hiding something or lying about stuff." Zeph's nose wrinkled. "I thought it meant he was guilty. That he had done it and was just good at pretending."

"A reasonable interpretation given available evidence."

"Except he did not die." Zeph stood up, pacing the small alcove. "The Salt judged him guilty of something. Something serious enough to activate. But it did not kill him instantly like it killed Lucchesi."

Cornelius's analytical mind engaged despite himself. "The compound's lethality depends on the severity and specificity of guilt. Lucchesi died within seconds. Near-instantaneous system failure. Valerian survived long enough for healing intervention, suggesting his guilt triggered the Salt but at lower threshold."

"So what does that mean? Different crimes get different levels of poison?"

"No. The same compound, the same dosage." Cornelius's tail began its familiar thinking-swish. "But Judgment Salt responds to the subject's own moral state. Their genuine belief in their guilt regarding the specific accusation. Lucchesi died because he knew—at a fundamental level—that he was guilty of whatever the Salt was judging him for."

"And Valerian?"

"Valerian's reaction was slower. Less catastrophic. Which suggests..." Cornelius paused. The logic assembled itself with careful precision. "Which suggests that while he carries guilt for something, he did not believe himself guilty of the primary accusation. Of murdering Lucchesi."

"Because he did not do it."

"Because he did not do it," Cornelius confirmed. "The Salt judged him for secondary transgression. Something real, something serious enough to activate the compound. But not the murder."

Zeph stopped pacing. "What secondary transgression?"

Cornelius thought back to the interrogation. To Valerian's sneezing. To the careful way the Sphinx had navigated questions about his relationship with Lucchesi.

"Theft, perhaps," he said slowly. "Of a different nature than we initially theorized. Valerian stole time. Stole credit for work. Stole..."

"Stole what?"

"I do not know. But something significant enough that he felt genuine guilt about it when accused." Cornelius's claws tapped against stone. "The sneeze timing. He did not sneeze when denying murder. He sneezed when discussing his need for Lucchesi to remain alive. When explaining his motives."

"So he was lying about the motives?"

"Or simplifying them. Or omitting details." Cornelius's wings shifted slightly. "Sphinx biology punishes outright falsehood but also punishes misleading truth. Valerian wanted something from Lucchesi beyond simple recognition. Something he could not admit publicly."

"Okay, but how does that help us?" Zeph returned to the bench. Sat. "Valerian is guilty of something. We still do not know what. And we definitely do not know who actually killed Lucchesi."

Cornelius was quiet. The pieces were assembling. Not into certainty. Not into ninety percent probability. But into... possibility.

"The Salt killed Lucchesi instantly," he said.

"Yeah. We saw that."

"Which means Lucchesi was profoundly guilty. The accusation—whatever it was—struck at fundamental truth about his moral state." Cornelius straightened on the bench, his academic posture returning. "And the tribunal accusation I made against Valerian centered on intellectual theft. On stealing credit. On exploiting a collaborator's work."

"Right. Which Lucchesi actually did do. To Valerian."

"Precisely." The logic clicked into place with satisfying precision. "I accused Valerian of murdering Lucchesi for stealing his work. But what if the Judgment Salt was not judging Valerian's guilt regarding murder? What if it was judging Valerian's guilt regarding theft?"

Zeph blinked. "But Valerian did not steal anything. Lucchesi stole from him."

"Exactly." Cornelius's tail swished faster. "Valerian is the victim of theft. His guilt must derive from something else. Some other transgression unrelated to intellectual property. But Lucchesi..."

"Lucchesi died instantly when he drank the Salt. Because he was guilty." Zeph's eyes widened. "Holy shit. The Salt killed him because he was the thief."

"Not merely a thief. The thief. The primary guilty party in whatever crime the Salt was calibrated to judge." Cornelius felt his analytical framework rebuilding itself. "The compound was not randomly deployed. It was specifically prepared to judge intellectual theft. Academic fraud. The theft of ideas and credit and work."

"So someone poisoned Lucchesi with Salt specifically designed to kill intellectual thieves?"

"Which means the killer knew about Lucchesi's theft. Knew the specifics. Knew enough to calibrate the Salt's judgment parameters." Cornelius's wings spread slightly. "And knew that Lucchesi's guilt was profound enough to trigger immediate lethality."

"Okay, but wait." Zeph held up one hand. "If the Salt was judging intellectual theft, why did it also hurt Valerian? He is the victim, not the thief."

Cornelius paused. The question was valid. The logic required adjustment.

"Valerian is guilty of something," he said slowly. "The Salt proved that. But perhaps not guilty of the same category of crime. Perhaps the killer prepared the Salt with multiple judgment parameters. Or perhaps..."

He stopped. Memory surfaced—Valerian's face during interrogation. The way he had described his relationship with Lucchesi. The exploitation. The ghostwriting. The uncredited work.

"Conspiracy," Cornelius said.

"What?"

"Valerian participated in the fraud. Not as primary perpetrator, but as accomplice. He wrote the books. He provided the intellectual labor. He allowed Lucchesi to claim credit in exchange for salary and occasional acknowledgment." Cornelius's analytical mind turned the theory over, examining it from multiple angles. "He was victim and participant both. Exploited, yes. But complicit in the exploitation."

"That is messed up."

"That is complicated moral reality." Cornelius's tail curled. "The Salt judges guilt, not victimization. Valerian carries genuine guilt for his participation in academic fraud. Enough guilt to trigger the compound. But not enough to kill him instantly because his role was secondary. Coerced."

"So Lucchesi died because he was the primary thief. Valerian nearly died because he helped. And the killer..." Zeph trailed off. "The killer knew about all of it. About the theft. About Valerian's complicity. About everything."

"The killer knew enough to weaponize Lucchesi's guilt," Cornelius confirmed. "Which suggests intimate knowledge of his academic career. His methods. His crimes."

They sat in silence for a moment. The alcove felt smaller suddenly. More focused.

"Giovanni," Zeph said finally. "Lucchesi's old collaborator. He would know about the theft. He accused Lucchesi of stealing his work."

"Giovanni is a viable suspect." Cornelius's claws tapped stone in thinking-rhythm. "But so is anyone else who had access to Lucchesi's academic history. His published collaborators. His research assistants. His—"

"His publisher?" Zeph suggested. "The woman in gray with the ink stains? Valerian said she visited Lucchesi privately multiple times."

"Publishers would have intimate knowledge of authorship questions. Of ghostwriting arrangements. Of intellectual property disputes." Cornelius felt certainty building again. Not ninety percent. Not yet. But stronger than hypothesis. "They would know who actually wrote what. Who deserved credit. Who was being defrauded."

"So we are back to suspects with knowledge and motive."

"We are back to logic." Cornelius adjusted his spectacles. "Proper logic. Based on evidence rather than elegant narrative. The Salt killed Lucchesi for intellectual theft. The killer knew about that theft in sufficient detail to calibrate the judgment. Therefore the killer has access to information about Lucchesi's academic fraud."

"Which is still like six different people."

"Which is a manageable suspect pool requiring systematic investigation." Cornelius spread his wings, shook himself once. "We need to access the records. Publication history. Collaboration documentation. Correspondence between Lucchesi and anyone involved in his research."

"Captain Melas said we have one hour before everything becomes official."

"Then we should not waste time sitting in alcoves." Cornelius launched from the bench, gliding to Zeph's shoulder. His weight settled into the familiar perch position. "The records storage is three corridors east. We can access the municipal archives using my Library credentials."

"You really think we can solve this in one hour?"

"No." Cornelius's honesty surprised him. "But we can gather evidence. We can document patterns. We can prepare a proper case built on data rather than assumption. And when Melas finishes his political maneuvering, we can present findings that merit actual investigation."

"So we are doing this." Zeph stood. Started walking. "Even though you got kicked off the case. Even though I am just an intern. We are really doing this."

"We are conducting independent research that happens to intersect with an ongoing investigation," Cornelius corrected. "That is entirely different from interfering with official procedure."

"If you say so."

They navigated the corridor in comfortable silence. Zeph's footsteps provided rhythm. Cornelius's weight shifted with each step, maintaining balance through long practice.

"Cornelius?" Zeph said after a moment.

"Yes?"

"You listened to me. About the Salt not killing Valerian. You actually listened and changed your theory based on what I said."

"Your observation was logically sound and evidentially supported. Ignoring it would have been foolish."

"Yeah, but you would have ignored it six hours ago. Before the tribunal thing."

Cornelius had no response to that. Because Zeph was correct. Six hours ago, Cornelius would have dismissed the observation as insufficient to override his elegant solution. Would have constructed rationalization for why the data fit his existing theory rather than revising the theory to match the data.

"Perhaps I am learning," he said finally.

"Good. Because two liabilities learning together is better than one liability being stubborn alone."

"That is not how the expression— " Cornelius stopped. Recognized the teasing tone. "You are deliberately misquoting our agreement."

"Maybe. But it is still true." Zeph turned a corner. The records storage entrance appeared ahead—solid door marked with official City Hall insignia. "So. We break in, find proof of who knew about Lucchesi's theft, and solve the murder before Melas files his fake charges. Easy."

"We do not break in. We utilize appropriate access protocols." But Cornelius felt something unfamiliar stirring in his chest. Not quite hope. Not yet.

But possibility. The glimmer of logic reassembling itself into useful structure. The familiar comfort of pattern-recognition turned toward truth rather than narrative elegance.

They had one hour.

It would have to be enough.
