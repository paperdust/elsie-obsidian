# Chapter 1

"You are certain the vintage is authentic?"

Cornelius Drake adjusted his spectacles with one bronze claw and squinted at the leather binding cradled in his other forearm. The first edition of *The Theory of Aether* deserved better than the crush of bodies currently threatening its existence. He tucked the volume closer to his chest, shielding it from the chaos of the Grand Rotunda.

The Mayor's assistant—a nervous human woman with ink stains on her fingers—nodded so hard her elaborate hairpins rattled. "Yes, Master Drake. Signore Lucchesi confirmed the book's provenance himself. He is quite eager to sign it for you."

"Eager." Cornelius allowed himself a small sniff of satisfaction. "As he should be."

The woman's smile wavered. She clearly wanted to escape. Cornelius permitted it with a slight incline of his head, and she fled toward the refreshment tables with unseemly haste.

Humans. Always in such a hurry to be elsewhere.

Cornelius spread his wings—each a careful three feet from tip to tip—and glided from the marble pedestal where he had been holding court to a more defensible position near the eastern colonnade. The motion drew stares, as it always did. He ignored them with the practiced ease of one hundred and twenty-seven years of being exceptional.

The Grand Rotunda of City Hall was, he had to admit, an acceptable venue for the Solterra Annual Gala, even if the event itself was a tedious exercise in social obligation. The space rose three stories, crowned by a dome painted with scenes of maritime commerce and mythological allegory. The floor was a geometric marvel of white marble and black basalt, arranged in patterns that pleased his sense of order. Columns ringed the space, their capitals carved with acanthus leaves and the symbols of the three Tile Families: the wave of House Kallistos, the flame of House Doukas, the geometric precision of House Veneti.

But the architecture could not compensate for the people.

They filled the Rotunda like a plague of well-dressed locusts, their voices echoing off the stone in a cacophony that set his teeth on edge. Silk rustled. Jewelry clinked. Somewhere, a satyr bellowed laughter that made Cornelius's ear-slits flatten against his skull.

He pressed himself against a column's cool surface and tried to calculate the fastest route to Fabrizio Lucchesi's signing table.

The author stood on a raised dais at the far end of the Rotunda, surrounded by admirers like a particularly verbose spider in a web of fawning flies. Lucchesi was tall for a human, with an elaborate mustache and the sort of flowing silk cravat that suggested a man who took himself very seriously indeed. He gestured broadly as he spoke, his rings catching the light from the oil lamps suspended overhead.

Cornelius's claws tightened on his book. All he needed was two minutes of the man's time. A signature. Perhaps a brief exchange of intellectual pleasantries. Then he could return to the Library, to the blessed silence of the stacks, to the cool darkness where books stayed precisely where one placed them and did not speak unless opened.

"Cornelius!"

He turned his head with deliberate slowness. The voice belonged to Cassius Nerva, the satyr-kin baker whose shop occupied the street three flights below the Library. Cassius waved from across the Rotunda, his curling horns adorned with small brass bells that chimed as he moved.

Cornelius pretended not to see him. It was not personal—Cassius made an acceptable mint tea and kept his ovens appropriately clean—but Cornelius had no intention of being drawn into conversation. Not when freedom was so close.

He tucked his wings tight against his body and slipped between two conversing couples, his small size finally an advantage. The trick to navigating human crowds, he had learned, was to move with purpose. Humans expected dragons to take up space, to demand attention. By staying low and quick, he could pass almost unnoticed.

Almost.

"Is that the Library Dragon?"

"Oh, how darling! Look at his little spectacles!"

Cornelius suppressed a hiss. He was not *darling*. He was a manifestation of pure knowledge, a guardian of civilization's collected wisdom, a creature of—

"Excuse me." A hand reached toward him. "May I pet you?"

"You may *not*." Cornelius bared his teeth—small, sharp, and numerous—in what was most definitely not a smile. "I am neither a cat nor a curiosity. I am consulting on a matter of extreme bibliographic importance, and if you value the structural integrity of your fingers, you will remove them from my personal space immediately."

The hand retreated. Its owner, a young elf woman in a gown that cost more than the Library's annual budget, looked appropriately mortified.

Cornelius continued his advance.

The signing table loomed closer. Fifteen feet. Ten. He could see the stack of Lucchesi's latest novel on the corner of the table, the covers garish with gilt lettering. *The Merchant's Gambit*. Trashy commercial fiction, but the man's earlier theoretical work had been groundbreaking. That was what mattered. That was what made this intolerable evening worthwhile.

"Master Drake!"

This voice, at least, was familiar. Cornelius paused and glanced up.

Zephyr Taraki threaded through the crowd with the graceless urgency of a sixteen-year-old who had grown three inches in the past month and had not yet adjusted to his new center of gravity. His intern. His responsibility, however temporary. And, judging by the boy's expression, his current problem.

Zeph's dark skin had gone gray at the edges, the way it did when the boy was about to be sick. His black hair—which gleamed with an odd bronze sheen in certain lights, though Zeph always dismissed this as "the oil I use"—stuck up at wild angles, as if he had been running his hands through it repeatedly. He wore his best tunic, the dark green one without any stains, and had even attempted to tame his collar.

He looked miserable.

"Boy." Cornelius kept his voice low. "You appear to be approximately thirty seconds from vomiting on a city official. Please tell me you have not been sampling the wine."

"I'm sixteen." Zeph's voice cracked halfway through the sentence. He winced. "I'm not drinking. I just... my head. The noise. It's so loud."

Cornelius tilted his head, studying the boy with the clinical detachment he usually reserved for damaged manuscripts. Zeph's pupils were dilated. His pulse—visible in the vein at his throat—was elevated. His breathing was shallow. Classic symptoms of a panic response, or possibly a migraine.

"Did you take the willow bark extract I provided?"

"Two doses." Zeph swallowed hard. "It's not helping. Maybe I should just go home. Tell Sophia I'm sorry. Tell her family—"

"You will do no such thing." Cornelius shifted his book to his other arm and used his tail to nudge Zeph toward a slightly less crowded corner. "You have been preparing for this social engagement for three weeks. You have memorized the names and business interests of Sophia Doukas's entire extended family. You have bathed. You have dressed. You are not retreating now because of a headache."

"Easy for you to say." Zeph leaned against the column, closing his eyes. "You don't have to meet your girlfriend's terrifying relatives while your brain tries to escape through your eye sockets."

"I do not have a girlfriend because I have sense." Cornelius peered at the boy more carefully. There was something odd about Zeph's scent tonight. Normally, the boy smelled of cheap soap, the particular mustiness of old paper, and whatever he had eaten for lunch. Tonight, there was an undercurrent of something sharper. Ozone, perhaps. The smell of a storm that had not yet broken.

Strange.

"Where is Miss Doukas currently?" Cornelius asked.

Zeph gestured vaguely toward the southern end of the Rotunda without opening his eyes. "Over there. With her mom. I'm supposed to join them in five minutes for the formal introduction thing, but I don't think I can—"

"You can." Cornelius made his voice firm. "Breathe. Focus on a fixed point. Allow your equilibrium to stabilize."

"I'm not gonna stabilize. I'm gonna throw up on the Matriarch of House Doukas and then Sophia will never speak to me again and I'll have to change my name and move to the coast and—"

"Zephyr." Cornelius waited until the boy opened one eye. "The human body is a remarkably resilient instrument. You are experiencing a stress response. It will pass. In the meantime, you will smile, you will bow at the appropriate depth, and you will make the entirely accurate observation that the Doukas family mosaics are the finest examples of modern geometric tile-work in the entire bay."

Zeph managed a weak smile. "You wrote that line for me."

"Because it is true. And because you require all the assistance you can acquire." Cornelius adjusted his spectacles again. "Now. I am going to obtain Signore Lucchesi's signature. You are going to remain here, practice your breathing exercises, and prepare to dazzle your beloved's family with your impeccable manners and sudden knowledge of decorative arts. Are we in agreement?"

"Yeah. Sure." Zeph slid down the column until he was sitting on the floor, knees drawn up. "Good luck with the signature."

"Luck is for the unprepared." Cornelius sniffed. "I am merely collecting what I am owed."

He left Zeph there and resumed his approach to the signing table. Three more steps. Two. One.

And then the crowd shifted.

A wave of silk-clad bodies surged around Lucchesi's table, all of them angling for the author's attention. Cornelius found himself trapped behind a wall of perfumed fabric and gesticulating hands. He craned his neck, trying to see over—or through—the obstacle, but it was useless. He was twelve pounds of dragon in a sea of enthusiastic humanity.

This would not stand.

Cornelius spread his wings, calculated the angle, and launched himself upward in a single powerful stroke. He caught the air, rose above the crowd, and landed with precise grace on the edge of Lucchesi's signing table.

The conversations around him stopped.

Lucchesi himself blinked, his pen frozen halfway to a book. Up close, the author was less impressive than his reputation suggested. His mustache was waxed to sharp points, and his cologne was aggressively floral. His eyes—a watery blue—fixed on Cornelius with an expression that hovered between delight and alarm.

"Ah," Lucchesi said, recovering quickly. His accent was thick, rolling vowels in the Valdesian style. "The famous Library Dragon. Master Drake, yes? I have heard much of you."

"Have you." Cornelius placed his own book on the table between them, positioning it with care. "Then you will understand why I have come."

Lucchesi glanced at the book. Something flickered across his face—too quick for Cornelius to identify—before the smile returned. "A first edition. How marvelous. You wish for me to sign it?"

"I do."

"But of course! It would be my honor." Lucchesi reached for the book.

Cornelius placed one claw on the cover. "Carefully."

The author's smile tightened, but he nodded. He opened to the title page with adequate respect, though Cornelius noted the man's hands were not as steady as one would expect from someone who made his living with a pen. Nerves, perhaps. Or wine.

Lucchesi uncapped his fountain pen—mother of pearl, ostentatious—and paused. "Should I inscribe it to you personally?"

"That will be acceptable."

The pen touched paper. Ink flowed. Cornelius watched with the intensity of a raptor observing prey, ensuring that each letter formed correctly, that no drops fell, that the signature itself matched the authenticated samples he had reviewed in preparation for this moment.

*To Cornelius Drake, a fellow scholar of the mysteries. With admiration, Fabrizio Lucchesi.*

The author blotted the signature, closed the book, and slid it back across the table.

"There. I hope it pleases you."

Cornelius inspected the inscription. The handwriting was adequate if somewhat florid. The ink was archival quality. The spelling was correct. He nodded once. "It is acceptable."

"High praise from a dragon." Lucchesi's smile warmed slightly, becoming almost genuine. "Tell me, do you plan to stay for my speech? I will be discussing the relationship between aetheric theory and narrative structure. It should interest you."

Cornelius had already tucked his book securely under one arm. "I had not intended—"

"Oh, but you must!" Lucchesi gestured broadly, nearly knocking over his inkwell. "A mind such as yours would appreciate the nuances. In fact, I insist. I will mention you by name. 'Even the esteemed Master Drake has honored us with his presence!' How would that be?"

Trapped. Cornelius felt the jaws of social obligation closing around him like a snare. If he refused now, he would appear rude. If he appeared rude, there would be talk. If there was talk, Imelda would hear of it. If Imelda heard of it, she would give him that look. The one that suggested profound disappointment without a single word.

"I suppose I could remain for a short while," Cornelius said, each word extracted like a tooth.

"Excellent!" Lucchesi beamed. "The speech begins in ten minutes. I promise not to bore you."

Cornelius very much doubted that, but he had made his choice. He gathered his book, spread his wings, and glided back down into the crowd.

The Rotunda had grown more crowded in his absence, if such a thing were possible. Servers in white tunics circulated with trays of wine and small savory pastries that left grease stains on fingers. A string quartet had set up near the eastern colonnade and was attempting something complicated by Veraldi, though the cellist kept speeding up at the cadences.

Cornelius retreated to his previous position by the column where he had left Zeph, only to find the boy missing. A scan of the room revealed him standing stiffly near a cluster of well-dressed humans who could only be the Doukas family. Sophia stood at the center, radiant in pale blue silk that complemented her dark hair. Her hand rested on Zeph's arm, but the boy looked like he was facing an execution rather than a social introduction.

As Cornelius watched, Zeph's face went from gray to nearly green. The boy said something, bowed with desperate formality, and fled toward the corridor that led to the washrooms.

Sophia watched him go, her expression unreadable.

Cornelius sighed. Young humans and their complicated emotional entanglements. He would have to speak with the boy later about managing his physical responses to stress. One could not be a successful scholar—or a successful anything—if one's body betrayed one at every moment of pressure.

A bell chimed. The conversations around the Rotunda quieted.

Mayor Tanit Barca stepped onto a small platform near the center of the room. She was an imposing woman, an orc with the kind of presence that commanded attention without effort. Her formal robes were embroidered with the seal of Solterra Bay, and her tusks had been decorated with silver caps for the occasion.

"Honored guests," she began, her voice carrying easily across the space. "Welcome to the Annual Solterra Gala. We gather tonight to celebrate not only our prosperity but also the arts and sciences that make our city a beacon of culture in these uncertain times."

Cornelius tuned out the speech. He had heard variations of it every year for the past three decades. The Mayor always praised the Tile Families. She always mentioned the importance of tradition and innovation in equal measure. She always expressed hope for the future while honoring the past.

It was boring, predictable, and entirely unnecessary.

He looked down at his book, running one claw gently along the spine. The leather was cool under his touch, worn smooth by a century of careful hands. Inside were theories that had changed the way scholars understood the fundamental nature of reality. Lucchesi had been young when he wrote this, barely thirty, but already brilliant.

The later works had been... less impressive. More commercial. Cornelius suspected the man had sold out, chasing popular acclaim rather than truth. But this book, this first edition, represented something pure. Knowledge for its own sake.

That was what mattered.

The Mayor concluded her remarks to polite applause and introduced Lucchesi with the kind of effusive praise that made Cornelius's scales itch. The author mounted the platform, bowing to the crowd with theatrical grace.

"My friends," Lucchesi began, spreading his arms wide. "Tonight, we celebrate the power of stories. Not merely to entertain, but to reveal. To transform. To connect us to truths that lie beyond the mundane!"

Cornelius settled in for what would undoubtedly be a long night.

The speech was, as predicted, largely empty rhetoric dressed up in flowery language. Lucchesi spoke of "the marriage of art and science," of "the aetheric resonance in narrative structure," and other phrases that sounded profound without actually meaning anything specific. 

Around the Rotunda, guests nodded and murmured appreciation. Cornelius remained still, his focus divided between the speech and the exits. The moment this performance concluded, he would make his escape. Imelda could not accuse him of rudeness if he had stayed for the entire—

Zeph stumbled back into the Rotunda, looking marginally less green but no happier. The boy spotted Cornelius and made his way over, moving carefully through the crowd as if any sudden motion might shatter him.

"How did it go?" Cornelius whispered.

"Her mom asked me about my career prospects." Zeph leaned against the column and closed his eyes again. "I said I was a library intern. She asked what my 'real' plans were. I said I hadn't decided. Then my head exploded and I had to run away."

"Metaphorically exploded."

"Feels pretty literal right now."

Cornelius frowned. The boy's distress seemed disproportionate to a simple headache, even a severe one. "Perhaps you should see a healer."

"After. Can't leave now. Sophia would..." Zeph trailed off, grimacing. "I'll be fine. How much longer?"

"He is beginning his conclusion." Cornelius gestured toward the platform with his tail. "Five minutes at most."

They waited in silence, or as close to silence as the crowded Rotunda allowed. Lucchesi built toward his finale, his voice rising with practiced emotion. Servants began circulating with trays of wine glasses, preparing for the traditional toast.

"And so," Lucchesi declared, accepting a glass from a nearby server, "I invite you all to raise your glasses. To Solterra Bay! To art! To science! To the beautiful marriage of both!"

The crowd reached for glasses. Cornelius, lacking both hands and interest, remained where he was. Beside him, Zeph tensed.

"You alright?" Cornelius asked quietly.

"Yeah. Just... the noise. Everyone moving at once. It's—" Zeph pressed his palms against his temples. "It's really loud."

Lucchesi raised his glass high. The light from the hanging lamps caught the wine, turning it deep red. "To truth!" he proclaimed.

"To truth!" the crowd echoed.

Cornelius watched with detached interest as Lucchesi brought the glass to his lips. The author drank deeply, his throat working.

Then stopped.

Lucchesi's eyes widened. His free hand went to his collar, clawing at the silk. The wine glass slipped from his fingers and shattered on the platform, red liquid spreading across white marble like blood.

The author tried to speak. Only a choked gasp emerged.

Then Fabrizio Lucchesi fell.

The crowd's cheer died. For one long, impossible moment, the Rotunda was silent except for the faint tinkling of the last shards of glass settling.

Then someone screamed.

Cornelius's claws tightened on his book as chaos erupted around him. His evening, he realized with profound irritation, had just become considerably more complicated.
