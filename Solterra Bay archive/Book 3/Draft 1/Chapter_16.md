# Chapter 16

The infirmary occupied a converted council chamber on City Hall's second floor. Cornelius had passed it dozens of times during previous visits to the municipal archives. He had never paid particular attention to the space. Council chambers were fundamentally uninteresting—designed for procedural meetings and administrative tedium.

Now the chamber functioned as emergency medical facility. The wooden doors stood closed. Two guards flanked the entrance in standard protective formation. Their posture suggested exhaustion tempered by professional discipline. Long night. Longer still before the lockdown ended.

Cornelius perched on Zeph's shoulder approximately thirty feet down the corridor. The position offered adequate visual access while maintaining reasonable distance. Not ideal for detailed observation. But sufficient for their immediate purpose.

Which was preventing Chloe Karellas from murdering Valerian.

Captain Melas stood between them and the infirmary entrance. His back was to Cornelius and Zeph. His attention focused on the guards and the closed doors beyond. He had listened to their theory with visible skepticism. Had questioned the logic. Had demanded evidence they could not provide.

But he had also accompanied them to the infirmary. Had positioned himself as barrier between potential threat and unconscious victim. Had ordered the guards to deny entry to anyone except authorized medical personnel.

Cornelius appreciated procedural caution. It was sensible. Defensible. Entirely inadequate.

"She will not simply announce herself," he said quietly. His voice carried just far enough for Zeph and the Captain to hear. "She will use pretense. False credentials. Siren influence if necessary."

Captain Melas did not turn around. "So you have said. Multiple times."

"I am ensuring clarity of expectations."

"You are repeating yourself." The Captain's shoulders rose and fell in slow breath. "I understand your theory. Young Siren believes Valerian threatened her family. Executed Lucchesi for adultery but the Salt judged intellectual theft instead. Attempted to kill Valerian at the tribunal. Will try again if given opportunity."

"That is not theory," Cornelius corrected. "That is evidence-supported hypothesis with approximately seventy-three percent certainty."

"Which is considerably less than one hundred percent." Captain Melas finally glanced back. His expression was unreadable in the dim corridor lighting. "You were ninety percent certain about Valerian. That did not end well."

The words landed with physical weight. Cornelius's tail curled tight against his body. The shame was fresh. Immediate. He had been wrong. Had been catastrophically wrong. Had nearly killed an innocent man through arrogant certainty.

But this was different. Had to be different.

"I am aware of my previous error," he said. Each word emerged with careful precision. "I am adjusting methodology accordingly. Current hypothesis accounts for new evidence including Zeph's danger sense and the timing of—"

"The magical headaches I am supposed to trust despite having no documentation or verification." Captain Melas turned fully now. His weathered face showed every hour of the investigation. Every political pressure. Every impossible decision. "You understand my position. Multiple conflicting theories from an analyst I officially removed from the case. A supposed magical sensitivity from a teenage intern with no formal training. All presented as justification for preventative detention of a Tile Family daughter based on speculation."

"Based on logic," Cornelius insisted.

"Based on your logic. Which has been wrong before." The Captain's voice was not unkind. Just exhausted. "I am here as precaution. As professional courtesy because Imelda vouched for you and because your previous errors do not negate your occasional usefulness. But if Chloe Karellas approaches this infirmary, I will speak with her. I will assess her stated purpose. I will deny entry if circumstances warrant. I will not arrest her on your hypothesis alone."

Cornelius wanted to argue. To insist that seventy-three percent certainty was sufficient for protective action. That the cost of inaction outweighed the risk of premature intervention.

But he had lost that argument already. His credibility was spent. His authority revoked. He was here on Captain Melas's tolerance and Imelda's reputation. Nothing more.

Zeph shifted beneath him. The movement was subtle but Cornelius felt it in the changing tension of shoulder muscles. Preparing to speak. Choosing words carefully.

"What if she tries to use Siren magic?" Zeph asked. "To influence the guards? To make them let her in?"

"Then I will be present to observe and intervene if necessary." Captain Melas's hand rested on his belt near the weighted baton. Standard Watch equipment. Non-lethal but effective. "I have worked with Sirens before. I know the signs of active influence."

"Do you?" Cornelius could not help the question. Could not suppress the analytical doubt. "Siren magic operates below conscious perception for most species. You might feel unusually sympathetic to her request. Might find her reasoning compelling. Might decide that allowing brief visit to unconscious patient serves no harm."

"I might." The Captain's expression hardened. "Or I might simply use professional judgment to assess legitimate versus suspicious behavior. You do not have monopoly on analytical thinking, Cornelius."

The rebuke was deserved. Cornelius forced his wings to fold properly. Forced his claws to relax their grip on Zeph's jacket. Forced himself to acknowledge that other people possessed functional intelligence.

"My apologies," he said. "I am... concerned about potential outcomes."

"As am I." Captain Melas turned back toward the infirmary. "Which is why I am standing here instead of processing witness statements. Now be quiet. If someone approaches, I need to hear them before they see me."

Cornelius fell silent. The corridor stretched in both directions. Empty now. Most witnesses had been released hours ago. Only key suspects and essential personnel remained in the lockdown. The building felt hollowed out. Waiting.

Zeph's breathing was audible in the quiet. Deeper than usual. The deliberate rhythm Cornelius had taught him for managing anxiety. In for four counts. Hold for four. Out for four. The pattern helped. Cornelius had observed the technique working multiple times tonight.

Though tonight was rapidly becoming this morning. The hour approached half past two. Nearly six hours since Lucchesi's death. Nearly four since Valerian's poisoning.

Time enough for plans to solidify. For desperate logic to justify terrible action.

If Cornelius's hypothesis was correct.

Seventy-three percent. Not ninety. Not certainty. Just probability weighted by available evidence. By Zeph's musical headache. By Chloe's bare ears at the tribunal. By the timing and targeting that suggested family protection rather than abstract justice.

It was enough to warrant precaution. Enough to justify standing guard over unconscious potential victim. But was it enough to—

Footsteps.

Cornelius's ear-tufts swiveled toward the sound. Coming from the eastern corridor. The direction of the main Rotunda. Measured pace. Not hurried. Not sneaking. Someone walking with purpose but not emergency.

Captain Melas heard it too. His posture shifted. Not aggressive. Just alert. Ready.

The footsteps grew closer. Resolved into visual presence.

Chloe Karellas rounded the corner.

She looked exactly as Cornelius remembered from the tribunal. Young. Composed. Her dark hair was pinned back in formal style that had loosened slightly over the long night. Her gala dress was still immaculate despite hours of lockdown. Sirens maintained appearances even under pressure. Cultural expectation. Personal discipline.

Her eyes were red. Not dramatically so. But enough to indicate recent tears. Her hands twisted together at her waist. The webbing between her fingers caught the lamplight. Translucent. Distinctive.

She walked straight toward the infirmary. Noticed Captain Melas. Stopped approximately ten feet from the entrance.

"Captain." Her voice was steady. Polite. "I need to see Valerian."

Not a request. A statement of need. Cornelius's analytical framework catalogued the phrasing. The certainty. The absence of pleading or negotiation.

Captain Melas did not move from his position. "The infirmary is restricted to authorized medical personnel. I cannot allow visitors at this time."

"He is my partner." Chloe's hands tightened. "I have right to see him. To know his condition. To be present if—" Her voice caught. Genuine emotion or excellent performance. "If his situation worsens."

Partner. The word choice was specific. Deliberate. Designed to invoke both emotional and legal standing.

"I was not informed of any registered partnership," Captain Melas said. His tone remained neutral. Professional. "My records indicate Valerian listed no family or designated contacts in Solterra Bay."

"We kept the relationship private." Chloe's chin lifted. "For professional reasons. He was assistant to a famous author. I am student. People would have assumed inappropriate power dynamics. Would have questioned his ethics. Our discretion protected both reputations."

The logic was plausible. Well-constructed. Exactly the kind of careful reasoning that would make sense to procedural authority.

Cornelius felt his certainty tick upward. Not dramatically. Perhaps seventy-five percent now. Because the lie was too smooth. Too prepared. Valerian had described his relationship history during interrogation. Had mentioned Lucchesi. Had revealed the exploitation and betrayal.

He had not mentioned Chloe. Had not indicated current romantic attachment. Had spoken of isolation and professional ambition. Not partnership.

"I will need verification," Captain Melas said. "Documentation of the relationship. Confirmation from Valerian himself when he regains consciousness. Until then, I cannot—"

"He might not regain consciousness." Chloe took a step forward. Her voice gained intensity. "The healer said his condition is unstable. That the poison damaged something internally. That the next few hours will determine whether he survives."

"All the more reason to maintain medical isolation. To prevent contamination or interference with treatment." The Captain's hand moved fractionally closer to his baton. "I sympathize with your concern. But my orders are clear. No visitors."

"Your orders." Chloe's expression shifted. Something harder underneath the grief. "Your orders are keeping me from the man I love. From being present for him when he needs me. When he—"

Her voice broke. She pressed one hand to her mouth. The other hand reached toward the infirmary doors. The gesture was pleading. Desperate.

And her ears were bare.

Cornelius saw it clearly now. No cuffs. No dampeners. Just small silver earrings with blue stones. Decorative rather than functional. The same configuration she had worn at the tribunal.

His wings spread slightly. The movement was involuntary. Physical response to analytical conclusion solidifying.

She was not wearing dampeners. Was not suppressing her magic. Was allowing—was encouraging—her Siren nature to influence the emotional resonance of this conversation.

Captain Melas might feel unusual sympathy. Might find her grief compelling. Might decide that brief compassionate visit served minimal harm.

"Please." Chloe's voice dropped to whisper. "Please let me see him."

The word carried weight. Texture. Not magical compulsion. Nothing so crude. Just emotional truth rendered through Siren vocal control. The sound made Cornelius want to help her. Made him feel her pain as immediate. Urgent.

Made him want to make exception.

He was library dragon with considerable resistance to magical influence. If he felt the pull, Captain Melas—fully human with compassionate nature—would feel it significantly more.

"You should let her in," Zeph said quietly.

Cornelius's head whipped around. "What?"

Zeph was not looking at Cornelius. His gaze was fixed on Chloe. His expression was strange. Distant. The way he looked when processing something through his developing guardian senses.

"She needs to see him," Zeph continued. His voice was flat. Analytical. "She is not going to leave until she does. She will keep trying. Keep pushing. Eventually someone will let her in."

"That is precisely why we are preventing access," Cornelius hissed.

"No. I mean..." Zeph's hand moved to his temple. Not pressing. Just touching. "The headache is back. Musical. Like at the tribunal. But it is not danger this time. It is... determination? Like she has already decided. Already committed. She is going to do this whether we stop her here or not."

Cornelius felt cold certainty slide down his spine. "Then we maintain barrier. We keep her away from Valerian until—"

"Until what? Until she finds another route? Another method? Until she influences different guard during different shift?" Zeph's dark eyes finally met Cornelius's golden gaze. "Or until we let her in and actually see what she does?"

The suggestion hung in the quiet corridor.

Captain Melas had not moved. His attention was still on Chloe. But Cornelius noticed the slight tilt of his head. The minute adjustment that indicated he was listening to the conversation behind him.

"You are proposing we allow potential murderer access to intended victim," Cornelius said slowly.

"I am proposing we confirm your theory instead of just standing here arguing about it." Zeph's voice was steady. "She is either here to mourn her partner or here to finish the job. If we let her in under controlled circumstances, we find out which."

"And if she succeeds in killing him during those controlled circumstances?"

"Then we stop her before she can." Zeph gestured toward Captain Melas. "We have Watch Captain right here. We have you watching. We have guards. And if she tries to use more Judgment Salt, we will see it. We will intervene."

The logic was sound. Terrible. Pragmatic. Exactly the kind of reasoning Cornelius himself might have employed before his spectacular failure at the tribunal.

Before he learned that elegant theories could kill innocent people.

"Captain Melas will not agree to this," Cornelius said.

"Actually." The Captain's voice was quiet. Thoughtful. "It has merit."

Cornelius's wings flared fully. "You cannot be serious."

"I am extremely serious." Captain Melas turned to face them partially. His expression was calculating. Professional. "Current situation: We have hypothesis that Chloe Karellas attempted to murder Valerian. We have no proof. No evidence that would support arrest or formal charges. No grounds for detention. If I deny her access and she departs, we learn nothing. We wait for her next attempt with no additional information or preparation."

"Or we maintain defensive position until you gather actual evidence through proper investigation," Cornelius argued.

"What investigation? What evidence?" The Captain's voice held frustrated edge. "I have no witnesses to her administering poison. No documentation linking her to Judgment Salt acquisition. No confession. Nothing except your logic and the boy's magical headaches."

"Guardian sense," Cornelius corrected automatically.

"Which I cannot verify. Cannot document. Cannot present to Mayor or Tile Families as justification for action." Captain Melas looked back at Chloe. She was still standing in that pleading posture. Still waiting for answer. "But if I allow supervised visit. If I maintain direct observation. If she attempts something actionable in my presence..."

"Then you have evidence," Zeph finished.

"Then I have grounds for intervention based on witnessed behavior rather than hypothesis."

Cornelius's analytical mind spun through implications. Through risks and potential outcomes. Through everything that could go catastrophically wrong with this plan.

"You are proposing to use Valerian as bait," he said.

"I am proposing to confirm or eliminate him as target." Captain Melas's jaw tightened. "Either Chloe visits unconscious partner and behaves appropriately, in which case your theory is wrong and we reassess. Or she attempts something suspicious, in which case I have justification to detain her and press charges. Either way, we gain information."

"Or she kills him before you can intervene."

"That is why you will be watching." The Captain's gaze was steady. "Your forensic vision. Your ability to identify substances and compounds. If she produces Judgment Salt or any other poison, you alert me immediately. I stop her before administration."

"I am thirty feet away down a dim corridor."

"Then move closer." Captain Melas gestured toward a recessed doorway approximately fifteen feet from the infirmary. Empty office or storage room. Shadowed. Adequate concealment for small dragon. "Position yourself there. Maintain visual line through the open door. The moment you see anything suspicious, you signal. I act."

Cornelius looked at the doorway. At the angle it provided. At the clear line of sight into the infirmary once the doors opened.

At the terrible elegant logic of using observation to generate evidence.

"This is dangerous," he said.

"Yes."

"This could result in Valerian's death."

"Many things could result in Valerian's death. Including denying access and waiting for Chloe to try again under less controlled circumstances." Captain Melas's expression was grim. "I am making tactical choice. Use current opportunity to confirm threat and gather evidence. Or lose opportunity and wait for next attempt with no additional information."

Zeph was very still on the bench where he sat. His hand had dropped from his temple. His eyes were closed. Breathing in the four-count pattern.

"What does your sense tell you?" Cornelius asked quietly.

Zeph opened his eyes. "That she is going to do it. Going to try. Whether we let her in now or she finds another way later. At least this way we are ready."

The certainty in his voice was absolute. Not analytical. Not theoretical. Just bone-deep knowing.

Guardian sense. Lamassu-touched awareness of threat and intention. The same sense that had screamed warning when Valerian reached for poisoned water.

Cornelius adjusted his spectacles with one claw. The familiar gesture helped settle his thoughts into working order.

Seventy-three percent certainty that Chloe was the killer. Perhaps eighty percent now with the bare ears and false partnership claim. Sufficient probability to warrant action. To justify risk.

"If I see poison," he said carefully, "if I identify Judgment Salt or any harmful compound, I will alert you immediately. You will stop her before administration."

"Agreed."

"And if I am wrong. If she truly is here to mourn. If my hypothesis is incorrect and we have just allowed grief-stricken partner access to dying loved one..." Cornelius's tail curled tight. "Then we will have caused unnecessary pain for no purpose."

"Then we will have eliminated suspect and redirected investigation appropriately." Captain Melas turned back toward Chloe. "Take your position. Stay hidden. Watch carefully."

Cornelius spread his wings. Glided from Zeph's shoulder to the recessed doorway. The angle was adequate. Not perfect. But sufficient for monitoring infirmary interior once doors opened.

He settled onto the stone threshold. Adjusted his spectacles. Focused his forensic vision.

Captain Melas walked toward Chloe. Her expression shifted from pleading desperation to cautious hope.

"I will allow brief visit," the Captain said. "Under strict conditions. You will be supervised. You will not touch medical equipment. You will not interfere with treatment. You will leave when I instruct. Any violation results in immediate removal and potential charges. Do you understand?"

Chloe nodded. Tears tracked down her face. Gratitude. Relief.

Cornelius watched her ears. Still bare. Still allowing influence.

Captain Melas gestured to the guards. "Open the door. Remain stationed inside. If I give signal, restrain Miss Karellas immediately."

The guards moved to comply. The wooden doors swung inward.

Beyond them, Cornelius saw converted council chamber. Saw cot against far wall where Valerian lay unconscious. Saw healer seated near the bedside with diagnostic equipment and notations.

Saw Chloe Karellas step across the threshold with Captain Melas close behind.

Saw the door remain open. Perfect sight line from concealed position.

The trap was set.

Now they would discover whether Cornelius's seventy-three percent certainty was sufficient.

Whether his adjusted methodology was improvement over previous arrogance.

Whether they would prevent murder or witness it.

Cornelius forced himself to breathe. To watch. To trust that logic and observation and carefully maintained distance would be enough this time.

Would have to be enough.
