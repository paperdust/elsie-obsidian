# Chapter 8

The evidence bag sat on the Mayor's desk like an accusation.

Cornelius had positioned it precisely in the center of the leather blotter, aligned with the edges at perfect right angles. The blue crystals inside caught the lamplight, refracting it into tiny violet sparks against the translucent material. Beautiful, in an abstract sense. Deadly, in a very concrete one.

Captain Melas had released Pavlos Karellas fifteen minutes ago. The man's alibi was airtight—surrounded by family and prominent witnesses during the entire critical window. His evasive answers about business dealings had been noted for future investigation, but they were not germane to the immediate question of murder.

Which left Cornelius sitting on a desk, staring at crystals, waiting for scientific confirmation of what his instincts had already concluded.

He did not enjoy waiting.

"She should be here by now," he muttered.

Melas glanced up from his notebook. The captain had commandeered the corner of the desk for his own workspace, spreading his notes into organized piles that suggested military training. "Imelda said an hour. It has been forty-seven minutes."

"Forty-eight." Cornelius adjusted his spectacles with one claw. "And she said approximately an hour, which could mean anywhere from fifty-five to sixty-five minutes depending on her interpretation of acceptable variance."

"You are aware that normal people do not calculate conversation timeframes to that degree of precision."

"I am aware that normal people make imprecise commitments and then wonder why coordination fails." Cornelius's tail moved in small, agitated arcs. "If one says 'an hour,' one should mean exactly sixty minutes. Language exists to convey specific meaning."

"Language also exists to avoid sounding like a timepiece." Melas made another notation. "She will arrive when she arrives. Your anxiety will not accelerate the process."

"I am not anxious. I am appropriately impatient given the gravity of the situation and the necessity of timely information."

"Right. That is a completely different thing."

Cornelius opened his mouth to deliver a lecture on the distinction between anxiety and justified impatience, then stopped. The captain was baiting him. Deliberately using conversational tactics to distract him from productive analysis.

It was working, which was irritating.

He forced his attention back to the evidence bag. The crystals were distinctive—that particular shade of blue-violet occurred in very few natural compounds, and even fewer alchemical preparations. The crystalline structure was regular, suggesting intentional formation rather than accidental precipitation. The size distribution was uniform, indicating careful grinding and sifting.

Someone had prepared this poison with skill and deliberation.

The thought settled uncomfortably in his mind. Premeditation suggested planning. Planning suggested motive strong enough to justify not just murder, but this specific method. And if his hypothesis about the crystals' identity was correct, the method itself carried implications that extended far beyond simple assassination.

The door opened without ceremony.

Imelda Kassiani entered as she did everything else—with absolute authority and no wasted motion. She wore her formal librarian's robes, the deep green fabric embroidered with copper thread in patterns that marked her rank. Her silver-white hair was still arranged in its traditional braided crown, though several hours of crisis management had loosened a few strands around her temples. She carried a leather document case that Cornelius recognized as coming from the Library's secure archive.

"Head Librarian," Melas said, standing. "Thank you for coming personally."

"I would not have delegated this." Imelda set the case on the desk beside Cornelius, her movements precise. She smelled faintly of reagents—sulfur and copper salts, the distinctive markers of alchemical testing. "The analysis required verification through three separate methodologies. I conducted all of them myself."

Cornelius felt his breathing accelerate slightly. "And?"

Imelda opened the case and withdrew a sheet of heavy paper covered in her meticulous handwriting. Chemical formulas. Test results. Comparative analysis against archived samples.

"Your identification was correct." She met his gaze directly, her ancient eyes steady. "The substance is *Sal Judicium*. Judgment Salt."

The words hung in the air like a pronouncement.

Cornelius had suspected. Had analyzed the crystalline structure and the method of death and arrived at the hypothesis through logical deduction. But having it confirmed—hearing Imelda say it with absolute certainty—transformed suspicion into horrible fact.

"You are certain?" His voice came out quieter than intended.

"I am never uncertain about alchemical identification." Imelda's tone carried the weight of nearly two centuries of scholarship. "I tested against authenticated samples from the Archive. The composition matches exactly. Rare earth minerals in specific proportion, ritually prepared according to methods documented in only five known texts. This is not a substance that occurs naturally or can be synthesized accidentally."

Melas had gone very still. "Explain what this means. For those of us without alchemical training."

Imelda turned to face him fully. When she spoke, her voice carried the cadence of lecture—clear, authoritative, designed to convey complex information to attentive students.

"Judgment Salt is an ancient compound with a unique property. When consumed, it remains completely inert in individuals who bear no significant guilt. They experience no symptoms whatsoever. The substance passes through their system harmlessly and is eliminated without consequence."

She paused, letting that information settle.

"However, when consumed by someone who carries genuine moral or legal guilt—someone who has committed acts they themselves recognize as wrong, or who has violated laws they understand to be just—the compound becomes violently toxic. Death occurs rapidly, usually within seconds of ingestion."

Melas's weathered face had shifted into an expression that Cornelius could not entirely parse. Something between horror and grim recognition.

"So it is not poison in the traditional sense," the captain said slowly. "It is a test."

"It is a judgment." Imelda's voice remained level, but Cornelius detected the undercurrent of professional distaste. "An alchemical manifestation of moral consequence. The guilty condemn themselves through the very act of consumption."

Cornelius's mind was already racing through implications. "The mechanism—is it psychological? Does it respond to the subject's own perception of guilt?"

"That is one theory. Another suggests it reacts to objective moral transgression independent of the subject's awareness or remorse." Imelda withdrew a second document from her case—this one older, the paper yellowed and covered in archaic script. "The texts disagree on the exact mechanism. What they agree on is the result. Only the guilty die."

"Which means Lucchesi was guilty." Melas said it flatly, establishing the obvious conclusion.

Cornelius felt something twist in his chest. The signed book sat beside him, its inscription still visible through the protective covering he had applied. *Knowledge is the foundation upon which all truth must rest.* Such noble words. Such certainty in the value of intellectual pursuit.

"Guilty of what?" he asked.

"That would be the relevant question." Imelda reclaimed the document, returning it carefully to her case. "Judgment Salt does not discriminate between types of guilt. Murder and fraud would trigger the same reaction. So would serious betrayal, deliberate harm, calculated exploitation. Any act the perpetrator understands to be genuinely wrong."

"Valerian said Lucchesi stole his intellectual work," Cornelius said. His analytical mind sorted through possibilities even as he spoke. "Claimed credit for research and writing that was not his own. That could constitute the kind of knowing wrong that would trigger the compound."

"It could," Imelda agreed. "Though one would need to determine whether Lucchesi himself felt genuine guilt over such actions. Many people rationalize their behavior into righteousness."

Melas had started pacing—short, controlled movements that suggested a military background trying to impose order on disturbing information. "How rare is this substance? You said it requires ritual preparation."

"Extremely rare. The base minerals are difficult to source even with unlimited funds. The preparation process requires both alchemical expertise and access to specific texts that describe the methodology. Those texts exist in perhaps a dozen collections worldwide." Imelda's gaze shifted to Cornelius. "We have one in the restricted archives. It has not been accessed in forty-three years."

"Meaning the killer either found another source for the information or has had access to that knowledge for decades," Cornelius said.

"Or brought the compound with them from elsewhere," Melas added. "If it is as stable as you suggest, it could have been prepared years ago and stored until needed."

"It is exceptionally stable. Properly sealed, it would remain potent indefinitely." Imelda folded her hands. "Which makes it ideal for patient planning."

Cornelius's tail had gone completely still. His mind constructed and deconstructed theories with mechanical precision. Someone had poisoned Lucchesi with a substance that only killed the guilty. That suggested the killer either knew about Lucchesi's wrongdoing specifically or was conducting a test to expose it. Either way, the method itself carried a message.

This was not murder for profit or passion. This was execution.

"We are dealing with someone who believes they are administering justice," he said quietly.

"That would be my assessment as well." Imelda's ancient eyes held his. "Judgment Salt is not a weapon of convenience. It is a weapon of moral certainty. The killer chose this method because they wanted Lucchesi judged."

The room felt colder suddenly. Cornelius adjusted his position on the desk, his claws clicking against wood as he redistributed his weight. The signed book seemed to mock him—this artifact of admiration for a man who had apparently died because his own conscience condemned him.

"How many people in Solterra Bay would have the knowledge to use this compound?" Melas had stopped pacing, his posture shifted into the alert stillness of active hunting.

"Hard to say with certainty. Academic alchemists definitely. Anyone with serious classical education might have encountered references. And of course, anyone who specifically researched methods of... moral enforcement." Imelda's mouth tightened slightly—the closest she came to visible disapproval. "There are traditions that value this kind of thing. Secret societies. Religious orders committed to rooting out corruption through supernatural means."

"Wonderful," Melas muttered. "So we are looking for either an academic with access to rare texts, or a religious fanatic with alchemical training, or possibly someone from a secret society dedicated to magical vigilantism."

"Those categories are not mutually exclusive," Cornelius pointed out. "Giovanni Conti has the academic background. So does Valerian, though we have largely eliminated him as a suspect. The Karellas family deals in rare imports—they could have sourced the compound through trade connections."

"Or the killer could be someone we have not yet identified." Melas retrieved his notebook, flipping to a fresh page. "Someone who attended the gala specifically to execute this plan."

Cornelius's mind rejected that hypothesis instinctively. "The timing was too precise. Access to Lucchesi's medication routine suggests intimate knowledge of his habits. This was an inside attack."

"Agreed. Which brings us back to our current suspect pool." Melas's pencil moved across paper with sharp, decisive strokes. "I will need to re-interview everyone with that framework in mind. Not looking for ordinary motive, but for moral crusading."

The door opened again—slowly this time, without the confidence of Imelda's entrance.

Zeph slipped into the room like a shadow trying not to be noticed. His face was pale, the kind of bloodless pallor that suggested either illness or shock. His dark hair stuck up at odd angles as if he had been running his hands through it repeatedly. The ozone scent that characterized his stress episodes clung to him faintly—not the overwhelming electrical charge from earlier, but present enough that Cornelius's sensitive nose detected it immediately.

Cornelius felt his attention sharpen with concern he would not have acknowledged aloud. "You look terrible."

"Thanks. That's helpful." Zeph closed the door behind him and leaned against it, his breathing slightly uneven. "Are you done with the Karellas interview?"

"For now." Melas was studying Zeph with the professional assessment of someone who spent his career reading physical distress. "Are you unwell? Do you require medical attention?"

"No. I'm fine. Just..." Zeph waved one hand vaguely. "Long night."

Cornelius did not believe that for a moment. Zeph's heart rate was elevated—he could hear it from across the room, faster than exhaustion alone would explain. The boy's hands were shaking slightly despite obvious efforts to control them.

Something had happened while he was wandering the corridors.

"What did you need to tell me?" Cornelius asked.

Zeph's gaze flicked to Imelda, then Melas, then back to Cornelius. "Is it okay to talk in front of everyone?"

"Head Librarian Kassiani has full clearance for any Library-related matters. Captain Melas is conducting the official investigation. Unless you witnessed something requiring strict confidentiality, general disclosure is appropriate."

"Right. Okay." Zeph pushed away from the door, moving to stand near the desk. His hands found his pockets—a defensive posture Cornelius recognized. "I overheard Pavlos Karellas talking to someone. One of his staff, I think. They were by the Records Storage area."

Melas's attention focused with predatory intensity. "When?"

"Maybe twenty minutes ago? I was trying to find a quiet place to—it doesn't matter. Point is, Karellas was giving orders about pushing through some delayed shipment. Told his guy to pressure the dockmaster, avoid Harbor Authority inspection, keep the family name off official documents using shell companies."

The captain's pencil was already moving. "Did he reference what the shipment contained?"

"No. But he mentioned keeping 'documents' secured with limited access. And he specifically said everything needed to look legitimate 'given tonight's unfortunate event with Lucchesi.'" Zeph's voice gained steadiness as he focused on the information rather than whatever was distressing him. "He's worried the murder investigation will create extra scrutiny that could expose whatever he's hiding."

Cornelius felt his analytical mind shift into a different configuration. Parallel crimes. Intersecting timelines. The possibility that Lucchesi's death had value beyond simple revenge—that it might serve to distract official attention from other illegal activities.

"Did Karellas see you?" Melas asked.

"No. I was around the corner. He walked right past without noticing."

"Good." The captain made several more notations. "That gives us leverage for a follow-up interrogation. Suspicion of customs fraud, document tampering, possible bribery of port officials. We can apply pressure there."

"But is it connected to the murder?" Zeph looked to Cornelius for confirmation. "Or is it just... separate criminal enterprise happening at the same time?"

Cornelius considered the question with appropriate seriousness. "The timing is suspicious, but correlation does not establish causation. Karellas's smuggling operation—assuming that is what we are discussing—could be entirely independent of Lucchesi's death. However, the killer's use of Judgment Salt suggests they may have been targeting other guilty parties as well."

He felt the theory crystallize as he spoke. "What if Lucchesi was not the only intended victim? What if the killer is working through a list?"

The room went silent.

Imelda's ancient eyes narrowed. "You are suggesting an orchestrated campaign rather than isolated revenge."

"I am suggesting that someone willing to use Judgment Salt is someone who has appointed themselves arbiter of moral worth. That kind of certainty rarely limits itself to a single target." Cornelius's tail began moving again, tracing patterns in the air as he thought aloud. "If the killer believes they are administering righteous judgment, they would logically continue until their mission was complete."

Melas swore quietly. "Which means everyone at that gala could be a potential target. Anyone guilty of anything the killer considers worthy of execution."

"Not anyone," Cornelius corrected. "Judgment Salt requires consumption. The killer needs access, opportunity, and method. They cannot simply distribute poison randomly—they need to place it where specific targets will ingest it."

"Lucchesi's medication routine," Zeph said. His voice had steadied further, falling into the collaborative pattern of investigation that seemed to ground him. "That was targeted and specific. The killer knew exactly when and how he would consume wine mixed with powder."

"Correct. Which means they studied him. Learned his habits. Waited for optimal opportunity." Cornelius looked at the evidence bag again, those beautiful deadly crystals catching lamplight. "And if they prepared that carefully for one victim, they might be preparing equally carefully for others."

A sound echoed from the corridor beyond the office—distant but clear in the late-night quiet of mostly-empty City Hall.

A scream.

Not the theatrical shriek of manufactured drama. This was genuine terror, raw and immediate.

Melas was already moving, his hand dropping to the truncheon at his belt as he crossed to the door in three long strides. Cornelius spread his wings and launched himself from the desk, gliding after the captain with Zeph close behind. Imelda followed at a more measured pace, her expression unreadable but her body language alert.

The corridor outside was dimly lit, most lamps turned down to conserve fuel. Their footsteps echoed on marble as they followed the source of the scream toward the Rotunda's entrance hall.

A woman stood frozen in the doorway—one of the catering staff based on her simple uniform. Her face was bone-white, one hand pressed to her mouth as if trying to force back further screaming.

She was staring at the wall beside the entrance.

Cornelius dropped to the floor and moved closer, his enhanced vision picking out details in the uncertain lamplight.

Someone had drawn a symbol on the wall. Fresh ink—still wet enough to gleam. The design was simple but precise: a perfect circle containing a stylized eye, its pupil rendered as a vertical slash reminiscent of certain reptilian species. Around the circle's perimeter, text in ancient script that Cornelius recognized from archival documents.

"*Culpa purgata sanguine,*" he read aloud. His voice sounded strange to his own ears—distant and academic even as his heart rate accelerated. "Guilt purged by blood."

Beneath the symbol, in the same careful hand: "Justice comes for all who deserve it."

Melas was already scanning the area, his professional instincts overriding shock. "When was this discovered?"

The catering woman managed to lower her hand from her mouth. "I—just now. I was checking the entrance hall to see if we could start cleaning. The wall was blank when we locked down the building."

"Making this very recent." The captain's weathered face had gone hard. "Within the last three hours."

Cornelius moved closer to the symbol, analyzing the ink composition through his specialized vision. Standard commercial ink, nothing exotic. The application was confident—no hesitation marks, no smudging. Whoever drew this had done so quickly and competently under time pressure.

"This confirms your theory," Imelda said quietly, standing beside him. "This is not murder. This is crusade."

Cornelius stared at the eye symbol, feeling certainty settle into his mind with the weight of documented fact.

They were not hunting an ordinary killer.

They were hunting someone who believed absolutely in their own righteousness. Someone who saw themselves as divine instrument. Someone who had killed once and was promising, with ancient script and fresh ink, to kill again.

The Judge.

And somewhere in this locked building, surrounded by guards and witnesses and official scrutiny, they were waiting to choose their next victim.
