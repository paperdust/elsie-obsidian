# STRUCTURAL STORY PLAN
*Based on RDL v1.0, Story Bible, and Cozy Mystery Module v1.2*

## STRUCTURE OVERVIEW
*   **Structure Type:** 4-Act Cozy Mystery Grid (Fixed 20 Chapters).
*   **Justification:** The cozy mystery genre relies on a rigid "beat sheet" to ensure fair play, pacing, and the correct distribution of clues/red herrings.
*   **Chapter Count:** 20 Chapters (approx. 2 scenes per chapter).

## NARRATIVE PHASES

### Phase 1: The Setup (Ch 1-5)
*   **Function:** Destabilization. Moving from "Daily Order" to "Murder Chaos."
*   **Dominant Axis:** Internal Axis (IA) bumps to +7 (Social Annoyance) then drops to 0 (Murder).
*   **Entropy:** Spikes from Low (1) to High (8).
*   **Major Decision:** Cornelius chooses to investigate rather than wait for the police (to save his book/Zeph).

### Phase 2: The Investigation (Ch 6-10)
*   **Function:** Escalation & False Confidence.
*   **Dominant Axis:** Relationship Axis (RA) fluctuates as Zeph/Cornelius bond over clues but clash over methods.
*   **Entropy:** Decreases slightly (simulated order) before spiking at Midpoint.
*   **Major Decision:** Cornelius focuses entirely on Valerian (Suspect D) as the culprit.

### Phase 3: The Crunch (Ch 11-15)
*   **Function:** Collapse & Reorientation.
*   **Dominant Axis:** External Axis (EA) drops to negative (Failure imminent).
*   **Entropy:** Steady High (6-8).
*   **Major Decision:** Cornelius admits his "Intellectual" approach failed and asks for help (Community).

### Phase 4: Showdown & Restoration (Ch 16-20)
*   **Function:** Synthesis & Resolution.
*   **Dominant Axis:** IA/RA stabilize at higher levels (Growth).
*   **Entropy:** Drops to 0 (stable) after resolution.
*   **Major Decision:** Using the "Illogical" clue (Zeph's migraine) to trap the killer.

## GENRE MODULE TOPOLOGY (The Attractors)
*   **Attractor A (Cozy Equilibrium):** **Chapter 1.** Establish City Hall magnificence & Cornelius's discomfort (He hates parties).
*   **Attractor B (The Intrusion):** **Chapter 2.** The Body Drop (Lucchesi).
*   **Attractor C (False Lead/Midpoint):** **Chapter 10.** Valerian Poisoning Event.
*   **Attractor D (Community Rally):** **Chapter 14.** The town helps Cornelius.
*   **Attractor E (Restoration):** **Chapter 20.** Back to the Library.

## SUBPLOT ARCHITECTURE (The Headache Date)
*   **Type:** Complicating / Romantic Subplot (Mirroring "Hidden Identity").
*   **Arc:**
    *   *Setup (Ch 1):* Zeph picks up Sophia; he is terrified.
    *   *Rising (Ch 4, 7):* The migraine starts at the Gala. Zeph looks rude/flaky fleeing conversations.
    *   *Crisis (Ch 12):* Sophia gently postpones "Meeting the Parents" because Zeph is clearly unwell. Zeph catastrophizes this as a total failure of his "Presentable Boyfriend" audition.
    *   *Resolution (Ch 19):* Zeph is revealed as a Hero (Lamassu). Sophia forgives him.
*   **Valley Placement:** Beats land in **Ch 1, 4, 7, 12, 19**.

## THRESHOLD MAP & CHAPTER FUNCTION OUTLINE

### ACT 1: THE SETUP
*   **Ch 1 (Equilibrium):** Intro Cornelius (At City Hall / Grumpy). Intro Zeph & Sophia (Date Nerves). **Backdrop:** The Gala begins.
*   **Ch 2 (The Intrusion):** **Threshold: Body Drop.** Lucchesi dies. Zeph's *First Migraine* spikes.
*   **Ch 3 (Complication):** Lock down. Theo takes charge. Initial simple theories fail.
*   **Ch 4 (Valley/Subplot):** Zeph tries to apologize to Sophia, but has to run off again (pain). Cornelius finds the first clue (Pencil lead).
*   **Ch 5 (The Big Push):** Cornelius decides to investigate. **Constraint:** All 6 Suspects on page.

### ACT 2: THE INVESTIGATION
*   **Ch 6 (Reaction):** Interviews start. Cornelius uses "Dragon Eyes" on the guest list/letters.
*   **Ch 7 (Valley/Subplot):** Deepening tension between Zeph/Sophia. Cornelius investigates Suspect F (Pavlos).
*   **Ch 8 (Pinch 1):** Obstacle. The "Judgement Salt" is identified, but the source is unknown.
*   **Ch 9 (False Confidence):** Clues pile up against Valerian (Sneeze interpreted as guilt, not allergy).
*   **Ch 10 (MIDPOINT):** **Threshold: The Second Poisoning.** Chloe realizes her mistake (Lucchesi wasn't the lover) and targets Valerian. Valerian drinks, collapses, but survives (Necessity). Zeph's *Second Migraine* spikes.

### ACT 3: THE CRUNCH
*   **Ch 11 (Reaction):** Valerian lives (Surprise). Cornelius's theory ("He killed for credit") is ruined.
*   **Ch 12 (Valley/Subplot):** **Crisis:** Sophia tells Zeph to "just go rest," postponing the intro. Zeph spirals, believing he ruined his chance.
*   **Ch 13 (Pinch 2):** "Dark Night of the Soul." Theo threatens to arrest Valerian anyway. Time is running out.
*   **Ch 14 (Rally):** Imelda steps in. She helps Cornelius re-examine the "Salt" logic. Diagnosis of Zeph's migraine as *Guardian Sense*.
*   **Ch 15 (The Twist):** **Threshold: The Realization.** The Salt kills *Guilty* people. Lucchesi died because he was a thief. Valerian survived because he was acting out of *Necessity*. The killer made a mistake.

### ACT 4: THE SHOWDOWN
*   **Ch 16 (Rising Challenge):** Killer (Chloe) is cornered. She thinks Valerian is still a threat to her family.
*   **Ch 17 (Epiphany):** Cornelius realizes the motive isn't *Professional* (Art Theft) but *Personal* (The Affair). Chloe isn't healing Valerian; she's trying to finish the job.
*   **Ch 18 (Confrontation):** The Trap. Zeph feels the *Third Headache*. Cornelius signals. Chloe is caught trying to spike the tea.
*   **Ch 19 (The Reveal):** Public confession (or parlor room explain). Subplot Resolution (Zeph/Sophia).
*   **Ch 20 (Restoration):** Return to Library. Book signed (by Valerian, the real author).

## DRAFTING STRATEGY
*   **Mode:** Chapter-by-Chapter.
*   **Focus:** Maintain the rigid grid. Ensure "Valley Chapters" give breathing room for the Zeph/Sophia drama.
*   **Next Step:** Begin Drafting Chapter 1.
