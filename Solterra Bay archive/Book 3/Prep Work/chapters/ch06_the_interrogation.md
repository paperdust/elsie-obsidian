# Chapter 6: The Interrogation

The interviews take place in the Mayor's Office. Cornelius sits behind the massive mahogany desk, looking for all the world like he owns the city. Theo leans against the wall, annoyed.
Valerian is questioned. The setting intimidates him—it's a seat of power.
Zeph sits on a velvet couch, far from the desk.
The dynamic is the same, but the "Official" weight of the room adds pressure to Valerian (+2 Fear).
