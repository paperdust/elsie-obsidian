# Chapter 12: The Valley (Crisis)

While Cornelius sulks, Zeph goes out to the corridor to find fresh air.
He runs into Sophia. She looks exhausted and embarrassed.
"Zeph," she says. "Just go home."
"I can't," Zeph says. "I have to finish this."
"There is nothing to finish!" Sophia explodes (quietly, because she is a lady). "A man is half-dead. You look like a ghost. My father is asking why I brought a... liability... to the Gala."
The word hangs there. *Liability.*
"I'm postponing the introduction," she says. "We can talk tomorrow. If you're feeling better."

It is a polite break-up. Zeph knows it.
He watches her walk back towards the VIP room (where Pavlos is charmed by her).
Zeph leans against the cold marble wall. His **V_Romance** crashes to 0. His **V_Shame** spikes to +8.
He considers leaving. Just walking out the service exit and going back to his efficiency apartment and his noodles.

But then he sees Cornelius. The great dragon is sitting on a bench, looking small.
Zeph realizes: "He's a liability too."
And strangely, that makes Zeph stay. Two liabilities are better than one.
