# Chapter 17: Epiphany

Chloe sits by Valerian's bedside. She is weeping.
Cornelius listens (eavesdrops) with his superior hearing.
"Why aren't you dead?" Chloe whispers. "You ruined everything. My mother cries every night because of you."
She pulls out a small vial.
Cornelius tenses.
"I'll make it right," she sobs. "I'll finish what I started."

Cornelius realizes: She isn't trying to heal him. She's trying to *correct her mistake*. She thinks he survived because she missed, or the dose was wrong. She doesn't understand that the Salt judged him *less guilty* because his part in the affair was out of necessity, not malice.
If she gives him more, she will kill him.
"She's not a monster," Cornelius whispers to Zeph. "She's a grieving daughter."
"We can't just tackle her," Zeph says. "She's a Siren. She'll scream. The whole building will shatter."
"We need to interrupt her," Cornelius says. "With kindness."

The Plan: They will enter the room not as police, but as hosts.
They will offer her Tea.
"Siren Law," Cornelius says. "If you are offered hospitality while tending the sick, you must accept."
It's a deep obscure rule, but Cornelius knows it.
"You're going to have tea with a killer?" Theo asks, horrified.
"I'm going to have tea with a lady," Cornelius corrects. "And then I'm going to arrest her."
