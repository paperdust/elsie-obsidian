# Chapter 20: Restoration

The Grand Library. Morning.
The sun streams through the stained glass. The "Invasion" of the Gala is being cleaned up by the staff.
Cornelius sits in his favorite chair. He has a cup of peppermint tea (unpoisoned) and a plate of crickets (high quality).
On his lap is *The Theory of Aether*.
Valerian (recovering, arm in a sling) stopped by earlier. He signed it.
*“To Cornelius - Who saw the truth. — Valerian (The Real One).”*

Imelda walks in. "The Mayor sent a thank you note. And a fine for the carpet you ruined."
Cornelius sniffs. "Small price to pay for Justice."
Zeph walks in, carrying a stack of books. He looks tired but happy.
"Headache?" Cornelius asks.
"Gone," Zeph says.
"Good," Cornelius says. "Because we have an inventory to finish. Chop chop."

Zeph smiles and starts shelving.
Cornelius watches him. He doesn't say "Good job" or "I'm proud of you."
He just pushes the plate of crickets slightly towards Zeph.
"Have a snack, boy. You look peaky."
It is the highest honor a dragon can bestow.
