# Chapter 18: The Confrontation

Cornelius knocks on the open door. "Miss Karellas? Might I offer you some tea? It's been a long night."
Chloe freezes. Vial in hand.
She looks at Valerian (unconscious). She looks at Cornelius (holding a silver tray).
The ancient law kicks in. She cannot refuse. She nods, trembling.
"Thank you," she whispers.

They sit. It is the most tense tea party in history.
Zeph stands by the door, acting as the waiter (and the radar).
Cornelius pours. "Peppermint. Good for the nerves."
He chats about the weather. About the Gala. About the unfortunate death of Signor Lucchesi.
"A tragedy," Cornelius says. "To die of such a... specific ailment."
Chloe's hand shakes. The teacup rattles.
"He was a thief," she whispers. "He stole it."
"Yes," Cornelius says. "We know."
Chloe looks up, eyes wide. "You know?"

"And we know you tried to fix it," Cornelius says gently. "But the Salt is tricky stuff, my dear. It judges the soul, not the deed."
Chloe reaches for her pocket (the vial).
Zeph gasps. A sharp **+8 Spike**.
"Don't!" Zeph shouts. "It's poison!"
Chloe uncorks the vial. "It's not poison! It's Truth!"
She tries to drink it herself (Suicide/Cleansing).

Cornelius moves faster than a cat. He swipes the vial from her hand with a dragon claw.
It shatters on the floor. The salt hisses as it eats the carpet.
"That," Cornelius says, "is a waste of good flooring."
Chloe collapses into sobs. The fight is over.
Theo steps in to handcuff her (gently).
