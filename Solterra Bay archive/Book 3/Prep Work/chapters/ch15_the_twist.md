# Chapter 15: The Twist (Threshold)

Cornelius is feeling triumphant. "It's Chloe! She killed Lucchesi to avenge Valerian!"
But Zeph shakes his head. "No. That doesn't make sense."
"Why?"
"Because of the headache," Zeph says. "It spiked when Valerian drank the toast. Today."
"Because he was poisoned," Cornelius says.
"No," Zeph insists. "Because the *danger* was near *him*."

Zeph closes his eyes. He traces the memory of the pain.
"The Salt," Zeph says. "Chloe bought it. She's a Siren. She loves her family."
"Yes," Cornelius says.
"But Valerian... is a fraud too," Zeph says.
Cornelius stops. "What?"
"Imelda said the book had *his* warmth. But Valerian is... hiding something. Not just the book."
"So?"
"So maybe... Lucchesi wasn't the only one lying," Zeph whispers.

Silence in the office.
If Valerian didn't write it... and Lucchesi didn't write it...
Who did?
And if Chloe *thought* Valerian was the genius... and found out he was a fraud...
"She didn't try to kill Lucchesi," Cornelius breathes. "She tried to kill the *Lover*. The man destroying her family."

The Salt was in Valerian's glass. Lucchesi took it by accident (or Valerian swapped them?).
No. The Salt was *Judgement*.
It killed Lucchesi because he *was* a thief.
It barely hurt Valerian because... he wasn't the thief? Or because he was *less* guilty?
No.
"We have to ask her," Cornelius says. "Before she realizes we know."

Act 3 Ends. They know *Who*. They are wrong about *Why*.
