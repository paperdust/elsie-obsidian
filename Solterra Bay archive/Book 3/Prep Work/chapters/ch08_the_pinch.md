# Chapter 8: The Pinch

Cornelius's "Assistant" (a small clockwork courier he keeps in the back office) returns with the analysis of the sample he stole.
**Result:** *Sal Judicium*. Judgement Salt.
**Properties:** Harmless to the innocent. Fatal to those with "heavy souls" (Guilt).
Cornelius reads the report and goes still. This changes everything.
"Lucchesi wasn't just murdered," Cornelius murmurs. "He was executed."
Zeph shudders. "So the killer thinks they're... justice?"
"Precisely," Cornelius says. "And it means Lucchesi was guilty of something terrible. High crimes. Only high crimes trigger the reaction."

Cornelius realizes he is looking for a Moral Crusader, not a petty criminal.
He looks at his suspect list again.
*   **Valerian:** Petty jealously. (Unlikely to use Judgement Salt).
*   **Pavlos:** Greed. (Unlikely).
*   **Chloe:** Love?
*   **Imelda:** The Critic. *Judgment* is her profession.
*   **Jasper:** The Fence. Pragmatic.
*   **Elara:** The Fan.

Cornelius's bias shifts instantly to **Imelda**. Or maybe still **Valerian** if he felt his work was "stolen" (a moral crime?).
But then, a constable bursts in. "Mr. Drake! You need to see this."
They rush to the main hall.
Someone has painted a symbol on the floor in spilled wine. An eye.
The killer is taunting them.

The chapter ends with the stakes raised. It's not just a murder; it's a ritual cleansing.
