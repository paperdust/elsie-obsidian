# Chapter 13: The Pinch (2)

Theo finds Cornelius and Zeph on the bench.
"Valerian is stable," Theo says. "I'm writing up the warrant. Attempted murder-suicide. Case closed."
"It doesn't fit," Cornelius croaks.
"It fits enough for the Mayor," Theo says. "He wants this over. The press is outside."
Theo gives them a deadline. "You have one hour before I file the paperwork. Then you both go home."

One hour.
Cornelius looks at Zeph. "We missed something."
"The Salt," Zeph says. "You said it judges the Guilty. Valerian survived."
"Barely," Cornelius says. "Because he was... mostly innocent?"
"No," Zeph says. "Because the salt wasn't meant for him? Or because... wait."
Zeph remembers the "Greasy" feeling from Valerian.
"Valerian *is* a thief," Zeph says. "He admitted it. So the salt *should* have killed him instantly if he stole the book."
"Unless," Cornelius realizes, wide-eyed. "Unless stealing the book wasn't a crime."
"How can stealing a book not be a crime?"
"If the book... belonged to him?"

The logic shifts.
If Valerian wrote the book, he didn't steal it.
If Lucchesi *stole* it from Valerian... then Lucchesi was the Thief.
The Salt killed Lucchesi because he was GUILTY of theft.
The Salt hurt Valerian but didn't kill him because he was INNOCENT (of theft).

The victim was the villain.
