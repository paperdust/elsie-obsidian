# Chapter 14: The Rally

Cornelius needs proof. He calls Imelda (who is in the waiting room).
"Imelda," Cornelius says via the intercom. "I need you to tell me about Valerian's prose style."
Imelda, confused but professional, answers. "It's derivative. Flowery. Over-emotional."
"And Lucchesi's?"
"Precise. Cold. Academic."
"Wait," Imelda pauses. "Actually... in *The Theory of Aether*, the style shifts. The emotional core is surprisingly... warm."
Cornelius grins. "Like Valerian's?"
Imelda gasps. "You think Lucchesi didn't write it?"

Confirmation.
Lucchesi was a fraud. He stole Valerian's work.
This explains why the Salt killed him.
And it explains why someone wanted him dead.
Not Valerian (who wanted credit).
But someone who wanted to *punish* Valerian? Or someone who hated Liars?

Zeph rubs his temples. "The headache," he says. "It wasn't Ozone. It was... Singing."
"Singing?" Cornelius asks.
"Like a voice. Trying to be heard. Trying to scream."
Imelda looks at the suspect list. "Chloe. The Siren."
"She's Irene's daughter," Zeph says.
"And Sirens... they are fiercely protective of their family," Imelda adds. "If she thought Lucchesi was the one destroying her home..."
"She would judge him," Cornelius finishes.

The Team is fully assembled (Cornelius, Zeph, Imelda). The Community has rallied to solve the puzzle.
