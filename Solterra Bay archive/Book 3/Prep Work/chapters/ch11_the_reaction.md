# Chapter 11: The Reaction

Pandemonium in the Rotunda. Medics are swarming Valerian.
Cornelius stands on the podium, looking utterly defeated. The "Great Detective" just poisoned a suspect in front of the town's elite.
Theo grabs Cornelius by the arm. "Office. Now."
The team retreats to the Mayor's Office. Valerian is carried out on a stretcher—alive, but barely.

Cornelius is in shock. His internal monologue is a mess of self-doubt (**IA -5**). "I was wrong. The logic was sound, but the result was... chaos."
Zeph is recovering from the +10 Migraine. He looks at Cornelius not with "I told you so" smugness, but with pity. "You didn't listen," Zeph whispers.
"I know," Cornelius snaps. "Do not lecture me, boy."

Theo delivers the ultimatum: "You are off the case, Drake. I'm arresting Valerian for murder-suicide attempt as soon as he wakes up."
Cornelius knows this is wrong. If Valerian drank the wine to prove his innocence, he didn't know it was poisoned. Someone *else* poisoned it.
But Cornelius has lost his credibility. He has no authority left.

The chapter ends with Cornelius stripped of his "Dignitary" status, sitting alone in the dark office while Theo manages the crowd.
