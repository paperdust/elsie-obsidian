# Chapter 16: Rising Challenge

Valerian has been moved to a temporary infirmary in the Mayor's Conference Room. A medic is watching him.
Chloe Karellas is pacing outside. She demands to see him. "I'm his partner! I need to know if he's okay!"
Theo is blocking the door. "He's unconscious, ma'am. No visitors."

Cornelius and Zeph watch from down the hall.
"She's desperate," Cornelius notes. "She knows he survived. And she knows that when he wakes up, he might realize who poisoned him."
"Or worse," Zeph says. "She realizes that the Salt didn't kill him... which means he's not the 'Man of Honor' she thought he was."
"So she needs to silence him?" Cornelius asks.
"No," Zeph says, rubbing his temple. "She needs to *save* him. In her mind. She used the Salt to purge the bad people. If Valerian isn't dead, maybe she thinks she didn't use enough?"
It's a twisted logic, but Siren logic is based on absolute devotion.

The danger isn't that she's a cold killer; it's that she's a "Fixer." And she's going to try to "Fix" the mistake.
Cornelius nods. "We need to let her in. But on our terms."
They approach Theo. "Let her see him," Cornelius whispers. "But leave the door open."

The chapter ends with Theo reluctantly stepping aside. Chloe rushes in. She doesn't have a weapon. She has a flask. Tea? Or more Salt?
