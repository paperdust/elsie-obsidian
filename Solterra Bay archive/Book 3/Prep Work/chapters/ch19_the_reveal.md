# Chapter 19: The Reveal

The aftermath. The police are taking statements.
Cornelius holds court in the Rotunda (now safe). He explains the logic to the Mayor, Theo, and the gathered guests (Parlor Room Scene).
"The Salt kills the Guilty. Chloe believed Lucchesi was the man destroying her family—her mother's secret lover. But she was mistaken. Lucchesi died because he was a thief of *words*, not hearts. Valerian, the true lover, survived the second dose because his heart was heavy with necessity, not malice."
The crowd is impressed. Cornelius preens.

Zeph stands to the side. He feels... fine. The headache is gone.
Sophia approaches him. She looks ashamed.
"Zeph," she says. "I heard what you did. You stood in front of her."
"She had salt," Zeph says, shrugging. (He doesn't mention he was terrified).
"You were brave," Sophia says. "I was... superficial."
She tries to take his hand.
Zeph looks at her. He looks at Cornelius, who is arguing about a parking ticket with the Mayor.
"I think," Zeph says, "I'm not really a Gala person, Sophia."
It's a gentle rejection. He realizes he doesn't want to be a Trophy Boyfriend. He wants to be a Detective.
Sophia nods, respecting him for the first time. "Okay. Friends?"
"Friends."

Zeph walks over to Cornelius.
"Ready to go, boy?" Cornelius asks. "This place smells like politics."
"Ready," Zeph says.
