# Chapter 3: Lockdown

Theo Melas orders the City Hall doors barred. The heavy oak doors boom shut.
"This is a municipal building, Theodore!" Cornelius shouts from the balcony. "You can't just lock the Mayor inside!"
"I just did," Theo barks.
Cornelius is actually impressed.

The guests are corralled into the main floor. The VIPs (suspects) are moved to the Mayor's Reception Room.
Cornelius joins them. "I am aiding the investigation," he declares.
Theo sighs. "Fine. But don't touch anything."

Zeph is slumped on a velvet bench in the hallway, the marble floor cold under his feet.
