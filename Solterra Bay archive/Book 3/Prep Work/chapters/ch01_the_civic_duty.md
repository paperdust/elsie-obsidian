# Chapter 1: The Civic Duty

Cornelius Drake, the Great Dragon of Solterra Bay, is "pleased" to be the guest of honor at the Solterra Annual Gala, in the sense that a cat is pleased to be given a bath. The event is held at **City Hall**, specifically the Grand Rotunda, a space Cornelius finds "acoustically offensive" and "poorly shelved."
He spends the opening scene critiquing the architecture and the flower arrangements, his **V_Superiority (+7)** rampant. He is only here because the Mayor insisted, and because he wants Lucchesi's signature on his first edition. He clutches the book like a shield.

Meanwhile, Zeph Taraki is vibrating with anxiety (**V_Anxiety +8**) as he picks up Sophia Doukas. He is terrified of entering the high-society world of the Gala. As they approach City Hall, the massive marble steps feel like a judgment. He gets his first "migraine" spike as they cross the threshold—a sharp, ozone-scented stab that nearly makes him trip. He covers it up, determined not to ruin the night.

The chapter establishes the contrast: Cornelius is the confident (but annoyed) outsider; Zeph is the desperate (and pained) insider-wannabe. The City Hall is filled with light, music, and potential suspects.
