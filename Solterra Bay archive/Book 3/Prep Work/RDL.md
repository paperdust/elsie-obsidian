RDL_VERSION: 1.0
SOURCE: Normalized from raw human brain dump (mystery_brainstorm_aether.md, world_bible.md, voice_guide.md) and cozy_mystery.md module.

CANON FACTS
(Explicit statements that must not change later)
- Protagonist is Cornelius Drake, a "Library Dragon" (size of a large house cat, non-combatant, hoard = books).
- Setting is Solterra Bay, a "sun-baked", "Stone/Heat/Light" Mediterranean-inspired fantasy town.
- Magic is "Cozy": restricted to domestic/mending utility (healing, repair, cooling). No fireballs/resurrection.
- "The Three Tile Families" (Kallistos, Doukas, Veneti) dominate local politics/industry.
- Cornelius's breath weapon is a tiny blue flame (pencil-thin) used for utility, not war.
- Imelda Kassiani (Elf) is Head Librarian and the only authority Cornelius respects.
- Zepher "Zeph" Taraki (Human/Lamassu-touched) is the intern/sidekick.
- Captain Theodoros "Theo" Melas is the Town Watch captain and primary institutional obstacle.
- "The Theory of Aether" is the specific book Cornelius wants signed by the victim.

SOFT PREFERENCES
(Strong author intent, flexible if needed)
- Sensory signature must emphasize "Heat, Light, Stone, and Salt" (Golden Hour aesthetic).
- Humorous contrast between Cornelius's haughty internal monologue and his actual size/power.
- "Competence Porn": Characters should be shown being skilled at their jobs (mending, baking, organizing).
- Food descriptions should be "Scarcity turned to Art" (simple, high-quality ingredients).
- Avoid generic fantasy tropes (taverns are guest houses, stew is fish soup).

OPEN QUESTIONS / AMBIGUITIES
(Unresolved, contradictory, or missing elements)
- The specific mechanics of "Judgement Salt" poison need precise definition (how it detects "guilt" vs. "shame").
- Valerian's specific "truth-allergy" reaction details (sneeze vs. cough vs. hives) needs consistency.
- The exact timeline of the Gala lockdown needs to be mapped to the 4-Act structure.

BOOK-LEVEL DATA
- Genre: Cozy Fantasy Mystery (NPE Module: COZY_MYSTERY v1.2)
- Tone / emotional register: Witty, warm, sunny, low-stakes violence but high social stakes. "Sherlock Holmes if he were a cat-sized dragon."
- Central tension (conflicting forces): Cornelius's Desire for Order/Book Signature vs. The Chaos of Murder/Investigation.
- Stakes (emotional and/or external):
  - External: Solterra Bay's reputation, the safety of the Gala guests.
  - Internal: Cornelius's need to complete his collection (The Signature) vs. his growing care for his "hoard" of people.
- Ending intention: Order restored, villain removed (not killed), Cornelius gets his signature (or a meaningful substitute), community bond strengthened.

CHARACTER OPERATING DATA
(Force-based, minimal, NPE-compatible)

PROTAGONIST: Cornelius Drake
- want: To obtain a valid signature from Fabrizio Lucchesi for his first edition.
- fear: Disorder, loss of books, being perceived as merely a "pet".
- wound: The indignity of being a small dragon in a world built for humans/humanoids.
- mask: "The Haughty Academic" (Hides his affection for his librarians).
- dominant vectors: 
  - V_Hoarding (+9): Obsessive protection of books/collection.
  - V_Efficiency (+8): Disdain for human messiness.
  - V_Duty (+6): Obligation to solve the puzzle (intellectual vanity).

PRIMARY COUNTERFORCE: The Murder / The Killer's Deception
(Systemic pressure: The Gala Lockdown / The Mystery)
- want: To conceal the specific nature of the guilt (The intended target vs. the actual victim).
- fear: Exposure of the family secret (Chloe saving the family).

RELATIONSHIP DYNAMICS
- Cornelius vs. Zeph: Mentor/Student (Grumpy/Sarcastic). Vector: Mutual Annoyance evolving into Protectiveness.
- Cornelius vs. Theo: Frenemies. Vector: V_Order (Shared goal) but frictional methods.
- Cornelius vs. Imelda: Pet/Owner (Denial). Imelda holds higher status (V_Authority +10).

WORLD / SETTING ANCHORS
- Fixed Locations:
  - The Library (The Hoard/Sanctuary).
  - The Gala (Event Location, likely Town Hall/Loggia).
  - Cassius's Bakery (The Hearth/Info Hub).
  - The Oar & Anchor (The Tavern/Docks).
- World Rules:
  - "The Episodic Invariant": Status quo must be restorable.
  - Magic dissolves/decays; physical clues persist.
  - Gossip travels faster than light (Field Strength 8/10).

SERIES DATA
- Long-arc tension: Cornelius defining his own nature (Dragon vs. Librarian).
- Recurring elements: The "Tile Family" feuds, The Library as a growing entity.
- Unresolved after this book: Zeph's full heritage/powers (Lamassu) is a slow-burn reveal.

GENRE-SPECIFIC EXTENSIONS (COZY MYSTERY)
- Extension name: The Solterra Mystery Framework
  - Justification: Mystery plots require rigid structural and character constraints.

  - THE CRIME:
    - Victim (Suspect A): Dr. Fabrizio Lucchesi (The Fraudulent Scholar).
    - Cause: "Judgement Salt" (Poison that kills only the guilty).
    - Twist: Intended for Valerian (The Lover/Ghostwriter), killed Lucchesi (The Fraud) due to unexpected "Grevious Guilt".

  - THE SUSPECT FLOWER (Venn Diagram of Secrets):
    - Suspect A (Victim): Lucchesi. Secret: He is a fraud.
    - Suspect B (Rival): Prof. Giovanni Conti. Motive: Jealousy. Secret: Public threats.
    - Suspect C (Killer): Chloe Karellas (The Daughter). Motive: Misguided Protection. Secret: Bought the poison for Valerian.
    - Suspect D (Red Herring/Ghostwriter): Valerian (Sphinx-kin). Motive: "Credit". Secret: Is the actual writer & Irene's lover. Midpoint: Poisoned but survives.
    - Suspect E (Cheater): Irene Karellas. Motive: Blackmail/Love. Secret: Affair with Valerian.
    - Suspect F (The Cuckold): Pavlos Karellas (Orc). Motive: Reputation. Secret: Alibi constraints (Old Code honor).

  - CONSTRAINTS:
    - Field: The Content Filter (10/10). No gore. "Blue veins" asphyxiation only.
    - Field: Gossip Network (8/10). Sleuth assumes everyone knows public secrets instantly.
    - Attractor: The Midpoint Twist. Valerian must survive the poison to prove "Lesser Guilt" or unique physiology.

NPE READINESS NOTES
- RDL completeness score: 8/10.
- Most underdefined force: The specific mechanism of the "Judgement Salt" – needs rules to prevent it being a "solve everything" device.
- Highest risk ambiguity: The "Gala" location details are sparse in the Bible; needs fleshing out as a "Closed Circle" environment.
- Recommended next step: Proceed to Story Bible / Scene Planning to map the 4 Acts to the Gala timeline.
