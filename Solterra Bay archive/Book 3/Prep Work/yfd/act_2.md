**act_purpose:** To complicate the simple murder into a "moral execution" by revealing the nature of the poison. Create a false narrative where Cornelius believes Valerian is the killer due to his nervousness and motive (stolen work). End with the Midpoint Disaster where Cornelius's arrogance leads to a second poisoning, proving his theory wrong.

**major_act_reveals:**
*   **The Weapon:** The poison is "Judgement Salt" (Sal Judicium), which only kills the guilty.
*   **The Motive (False):** Cornelius deduces Valerian killed Lucchesi to reclaim credit for his work.
*   **The Motive (Real - Hinted):** The killer is targeting "sinners."
*   **The Symbol:** An "Eye" is painted in wine, suggesting a ritual aspect.
*   **Valerian's Secret:** He *is* the ghostwriter and the lover of Irene Karellas.

### tentpole_events

**tentpole_event_1:** **The Interrogations (Fun & Games).** Cornelius interviews the suspects in the Mayor's office. The contrast between his small physical stature and his massive intellectual presence drives the scenes.

**tentpole_event_2:** **The Pinch (The Science).** The analysis of the salt reveals it is *Sal Judicium*, changing the crime from a simple poisoning to a targeted execution of the "Guilt-Ridden."

**tentpole_event_3:** **The Midpoint Disaster (The Accusation).** Cornelius gathers the suspects to accuse Valerian. Valerian drinks (or is poisoned) and collapses, proving he was a *victim*, not the killer (or at least, that the killer is still active).

**tentpole_tag:** The Interrogation Begins

**characters_in_this_chapter:** Cornelius, Zeph, Valerian (Suspect D), Captain Theo.

**pov_details:** Cornelius Drake, Third Person Limited, Past Tense.

**setting_and_timeline:** Mayor's Office. 22:00.

**emotional_shift:** From **Suspicion** to **Conviction**.

**authorial_intent_and_subtext:** Establishing Valerian as the "Perfect Suspect." He is nervous, sweaty, and hiding something (his affair/ghostwriting). Cornelius interprets this as "Murderer's Guilt."

**key_information_and_world_building_revealed:**
*   **Character:** Valerian is a Sphinx-kin (can't lie without physical symptoms, like sneezing/hives). He is sneezing constantly.
*   **Plot/Mystery:** Valerian admits he was "close" to Lucchesi but hated him.
*   **World-Building:** Sphinx-kin physiology is a known truth-detector.

**subplot_advancement:** Zeph is taking notes but keeps rubbing his temples (migraine). He feels sorry for Valerian.

**end_of_chapter_hook:** Valerian sneezes violently when asked if he killed Lucchesi. Cornelius takes this as a confession.

**chapter_summary_for_writer:** Cornelius interrogates Valerian in the Mayor's plush office, using the desk to impose authority despite his size. Valerian is a wreck—sweating, shaking, and sneezing. Cornelius presses him on his relationship with Lucchesi. Valerian admits Lucchesi was a tyrant who stole credit, but denies killing him. He sneezes immediately after the denial. Cornelius exchanges a look with Theo; the "truth allergy" seems to confirm Valerian's guilt. Zeph, however, looks doubtful, noting the sneeze didn't feel "right" (it was too delayed).

### chapter_7

**setting_and_timeline:** Hall of Mayors (Portrait Gallery). 22:30.

**emotional_shift:** From **Shame** to **Defensiveness**.

**authorial_intent_and_subtext:** Contrast the high-stakes murder with the high-stakes relationship drama. Zeph feels unworthy of Sophia.

**key_information_and_world_building_revealed:**
*   **Character:** Sophia is disappointed, not angry. She thinks Zeph is just weak/flaky.
*   **Plot/Mystery:** Zeph overhears Pavlos Karellas talking to a "shadow" (implied lackey) about "keeping the shipment quiet."
*   **World-Building:** The Hall of Mayors shows the history of the Tile Families.

**subplot_advancement:** Sophia confronts Zeph about abandoning her. He can't tell her about the danger sense.

**end_of_chapter_hook:** Zeph returns to the office to find Cornelius interrogating Pavlos, who is arrogant and dismissive.

**chapter_summary_for_writer:** Zeph escapes the stifling office to clear his head. He wanders into the Hall of Mayors, where Sophia finds him. She confronts him about his disappearance, accusing him of not caring about meeting her parents. Zeph, crippled by the migraine, can't explain the magical danger without sounding crazy. They fight. Sophia leaves him there. As Zeph composes himself, he spots Pavlos Karellas in the shadows, making a hushed, aggressive deal with a subordinate. Zeph realizes the "Aristocracy" has secrets unrelated to the murder.

### chapter_8

**instructions:** Write Chapter 8. The POV is strictly **Cornelius Drake** in **Third Person Limited**. Follow the outline's chapter summary and emotional shift precisely.

**setting_and_timeline:** Mayor's Office / Back Room. 23:00.

**emotional_shift:** From **Procedural** to **Horror/Awe**.

**key_information_and_world_building_revealed:**
*   **Character:** Imelda (Head Librarian) arrives with the test results. She is competent and scary.
*   **Plot/Mystery:** The blue crystals are **Judgement Salt** (*Sal Judicium*). It is harmless to the innocent, fatal to the guilty.
*   **World-Building:** Magic that judges morality is ancient and strictly regulated.

**subplot_advancement:** Zeph returns, pale. Cornelius actually asks if he's okay (a moment of care), then dismisses it.

**end_of_chapter_hook:** A scream from the hallway. They find the "Eye" symbol.

**chapter_summary_for_writer:** Imelda Kassiani arrives, bypassing the police line to deliver a report to Cornelius. She has analyzed the sample Cornelius "acquired." It is Judgement Salt. Cornelius is stunned; this poison requires intent and a heavy soul to work. It implies Lucchesi wasn't just a victim, but a sinner. The mood shifts from a whodunit to a thriller. If the killer is using Judgement Salt, they believe they are a righteous executioner. Suddenly, a scream echoes from the corridor.

### chapter_9

**instructions:** Write Chapter 9. The POV is strictly **Cornelius Drake** in **Third Person Limited**. Follow the outline's chapter summary and emotional shift precisely.

**tentpole_tag:** False Confidence

**key_information_and_world_building_revealed:**
*   **Character:** Cornelius loves the theatricality of a "Summing Up."
*   **Plot/Mystery:** Cornelius weaves a story: Valerian wrote the books, Lucchesi stole them, Valerian snapped and used the Salt to "Judge" the thief.
*   **World-Building:** The "Eye" symbol is dismissed by Cornelius as dramatic flair, but the reader should worry.

**subplot_advancement:** Zeph tries to warn Cornelius that Valerian feels "Wrong" (not dangerous), but Cornelius is too busy being right.

**end_of_chapter_hook:** Cornelius orders everyone to the Rotunda for the revelation.

**chapter_summary_for_writer:** They find a crude eye painted in wine near the scene. Cornelius dismisses it as Valerian trying to look like a fanatic to cover his tracks. He outlines his "Perfect Theory" to Theo: Valerian, the ghostwriter, killed his oppressor, Lucchesi. The sneezing was guilt. The motive is intellectual theft. It fits perfectly. Cornelius, high on his own brilliance, decides to gather the suspects in the Rotunda to unveil the truth and force a confession. He ignores Zeph's weak protest that Valerian seems "too scared to be a judge."

### chapter_10

**instructions:** Write Chapter 10. The POV is strictly **Cornelius Drake** in **Third Person Limited**. Follow the outline's chapter summary and emotional shift precisely.

**tentpole_tag:** Midpoint Disaster / The Accusation

*   **Plot/Mystery:** Valerian drinks (water or wine) and collapses, frothing.
*   **World-Building:** The poison acts fast.

**subplot_advancement:** Zeph's migraine hits a crescendo right before Valerian drinks—the "Danger Sense" maxing out.

**end_of_chapter_hook:** Valerian is down. Cornelius realizes he was wrong. The killer is still in the room.

**chapter_summary_for_writer:** The suspects are gathered under the dome. Cornelius delivers his accusation, laying out Valerian's motive and method with merciless logic. Valerian weeps, denying it, but looks guilty. He reaches for a glass of water on the table to calm his nerves. Zeph shouts "Don't!" but it's too late. Valerian drinks. He immediately convulses and collapses, foaming at the mouth. The crowd screams. Cornelius stands frozen on the podium, his perfect theory shattered. Valerian wasn't the killer; he was the next victim.

### subplot_tracking

**subplot_development_1:** Zeph's migraine serves as a truthful counterpoint to Cornelius's logic, but is ignored.

**subplot_development_2:** Zeph and Sophia's relationship hits a low point; she thinks he's unreliable.
