*   **Scene:** Chapter 8. The Salt Connection.
*   **Action:** The "Judgement Salt" is identified as the weapon, but its source is unknown.

**beat_5_second_pinch (Dark Night of the Soul):**

**beat_6_the_twist (Epiphany):**
*   **Scene:** Chapter 15/17. The Motive Realization.
*   **Action:** Cornelius realizes the "Judgement Salt" targets *guilt*. Lucchesi died because he was a thief. Valerian survived because his guilt was "Necessity" (feeding family). The killer *missed* their target (The Lover/Writer) the first time. The motive is *Personal* (Affair), not *Professional*.

**beat_7_showdown (The Trap):**
*   **Scene:** Chapter 18. The Tea Service.
*   **Action:** Cornelius sets a trap. Zeph feels a "Third Headache" (signalling the killer's intent). Cornelius signals. Chloe (The Daughter) is caught trying to spike the tea.

### subgenre_specific_scenes (Cozy Mystery)

**signature_scene_1 (The Discovery):**
*   **Description:** The "Clean" Death. Lucchesi falls. No blood, just a "wrongness" to the pose. Cornelius notices the *paper* in his pocket vs the *ink* on his fingers (Forensic Vision).
*   **Genre Relevance:** Focus on the *puzzle* and the *anomaly*, not the horror.

**signature_scene_2 (The Community Rally):**
*   **Description:** Chapter 14. Imelda and the town helps Cornelius re-examine the logic, showing that "Solo Genius" (Sherlock style) is less effective than "Community Wisdom" (Cozy style).
*   **Genre Relevance:** Reaffirms the "Cozy" value of community.

**signature_scene_3 (The Parlor Reveal):**
*   **Description:** Chapter 19. Cornelius explains the crime to the assembled guests (or just Theo/Zeph/Sophia). The "How-Catchem" moment.
*   **Genre Relevance:** Fulfills the intellectual promise of the genre.
