### overview_setting_summary
**overview_setting_summary:** Solterra Bay is a vertical, sun-drenched coastal town built of white stone and terracotta. It is a place of "Scarcity turned to Art," defined by the smell of salt, hot stone, and old paper. The population is a cosmopolitan mix of Humans, Mythological Kin (Sirens, Satyrs, Sphinxes), Elves, and Orcs, all integrated into a bustling merchant society dominated by the rival Tile Families.

### key_world_details

**key_world_detail_1:** **The Tile Families:** Three rival houses (Kallistos, Doukas, Veneti) control the economy and politics. Their feuds regarding tradition vs. innovation drive the social tension.

**key_world_detail_2:** **Mythological Coexistence:** "Kin" species (Sirens, Gorgons, Satyrs) are not hidden/magical creatures but everyday citizens with specific roles (e.g., Gorgons as masons, Sirens as fishermen).

**key_world_detail_3:** **Draconic Ecology:** Library Dragons like Cornelius are not born biologically but "manifest" from a Critical Mass of Knowledge. They bond to the library first, the librarian second.

**key_world_detail_4:** **The Sensory Signature:** The town is defined by *Heat* (Sunlight), *Stone* (Architecture), and *Salt* (Sea). It is an "Illuminated" world where secrets are hard to hide.

**key_world_detail_5:** **Technology Level:** Antiquity/Early Medieval. No electricity; lighting is oil/beeswax. Advanced aqueducts. Communication via Centaur Couriers or Ships.

### key_world_rules

**key_world_rule_1:** **Lethality is Low/Non-Graphic:** Violence is physical but rarely deadly; the focus is on social/political conflict. Magic heals but cannot resurrect.

**key_world_rule_2:** **Magic is Domestic:** Magic is used for mending pots, heating tea, or cleaning; combat magic (fireballs) is nonexistent.

**key_world_rule_3:** **The Gossip Field:** Information travels instantly via an ambient "Gossip Network." If two people know a secret, the whole town knows by noon.

**key_world_rule_4:** **Species Abilities are Mundane:** A Siren's voice calms storms/brawls; a Gorgon's gaze stuns for safety. Abilities are integrated into labor, not war.

**key_world_rule_5:** **The Episodic Invariant:** The town must return to a recognizable status quo (Order) by the end of the mystery.
