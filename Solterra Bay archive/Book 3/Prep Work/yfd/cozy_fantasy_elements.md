### cozy_fantasy_mystery_elements

**genre_centrality:**
*   **Logic:** The fantasy elements are not for war or epic quests, but for "Domestic Convenience" and "Mystery Solving." Magic is a tool for order (Cornelius) or intuition (Zeph), not destruction. The "Cozy" aspect demands low lethality and high warmth.

**magical_laws_and_crimes:**
*   **Forensic Vision:** Cornelius (Library Dragon) can see the age of ink, the weave of paper, and the chemical composition of tea. *Constraint:* He cannot see "intent," only physical facts.
*   **Guardian Sense:** Zephyr (Lamassu) suffers migraines when "Danger" or "Malice" is near. *Constraint:* It is imprecise (a "blunt instrument") and debilitating.
*   **Truth-Sense:** Valerian (Sphinx-kin) sneezes when he hears a lie. *Constraint:* He sneezes at *any* untruth, including polite social lies, making him a social pariah.

**fantasy_species_roles:**
*   **Library Dragons:** Cat-sized, hoard books/knowledge, breathe warming fire (for tea/grates), obsessed with Order.
*   **Lamassu:** Protectors, empathetic, prone to sensory overload in chaotic environments (like Galas).
*   **Sirens:** Their voice can influence emotion, but in a "Cozy" setting, it's used for conflict resolution or art, not drowning sailors. (Chloe uses it to "defuse" tension, or in this case, to mask her crime).
*   **Sphinx-kin:** Obsessed with Riddles and Truth. Cannot lie without physical pain.

**cozy_tropes_integration:**
*   **The Closed Circle:** A magical storm or "Lockdown Spell" isn't needed; the social pressure of the Gala and the Watch Captain's orders keep everyone in City Hall.
*   **The Amateur Sleuth:** Cornelius uses his "Outsider Perspective" (Non-human logic) to solve what the human guards miss.
*   **Domestic Magic:** Imelda uses magic to tidy rooms, organize papers, and brew perfect tea. This sets the "Cozy" atmosphere—magic serves the home.

**mystery_stakes_and_magic:**
*   **The Weapon:** "Judgement Salt." A magical alchemical substance that only kills the *guilty*.
*   **The Twist:** The victim (Lucchesi) died not because he was the *target*, but because he was *guilty* (of theft). The magic worked correctly; the killer's aim was off.
*   **Safety vs Justice:** The town relies on "Order" (Magic/Law), but the resolution depends on "Community" (Messy feelings).

**signature_magic_scenes:**
*   **The Tea Test:** Cornelius heating the tea with a precise breath to activate the antidote/reveal the poison.
*   **The Migraine Radar:** Zeph navigating the crowd, wincing as he gets closer to the killer, guiding Cornelius like a Geiger counter.
*   **The Hoard:** Cornelius retreating to his "Hoard" (The Library) to think, physically curling around the evidence.

**setting_atmosphere (Solterra):**
*   **Sensory Signature:** Heat, bright sunlight, white stone, smell of salt and old paper. A place of "Illumination" where secrets are hard to hide.
*   **Magical Texture:** The air hums with the "Gossip Field" (Information travels instantly via magic/social osmosis).
