**genre_and_subgenres:** Cozy Fantasy Mystery. Subgenres: Low Fantasy, Humorous Fantasy.

**projected_length:** 45,000 - 55,000 words (20 Chapters).

**position_in_series:** Book 1 of a potential series. Introduces the "Detective Duo" and the Setting. Standalone mystery with ongoing character arcs.

**target_audience:** Adult (Cozy). Fans of "Legends & Lattes" meets "Poirot." Readers who want low-stakes comfort with intellectual engagement.

**tone:** Witty, sunny, warm. "Sherlock Holmes if he were a cat-sized dragon." High whimsicality, low grit.

**humor:** Character-driven. Derived from Cornelius's haughty internal monologue clashing with mundane reality, and Zeph's sarcastic commentary.

**heat_spice_level:** 1/5. "Sweet/Clean." Romance is a subplot (Zeph/Sophia) and follows "Cozy" rules (Fade-to-black or just kissing).

**magic_and_violence_level:** Low / Domestic. Magic is for household chores or specific utility (mending/heating), not combat. Violence is "off-screen" or non-lethal (stun/paralysis).

**tense:** Past Tense.

**narration_split:** Dual POV. Dominant: Cornelius Drake (approx 70%). Secondary: Zephyr Taraki (approx 30%).

### core_concept

**story_hook:** When a haughty, cat-sized Library Dragon is forced to attend a high-society gala, he must solve the murder of a famous author to clear his town's name—and get back to his books before the tea gets cold.

**central_conflict:**
*   **External:** Finding the killer of Fabrizio Lucchesi before the Watch Captain arrests the wrong man.
*   **Internal:** Cornelius's struggle to admit that "Community" (messy people) is just as valuable as "Order" (clean books).

**high_concept_pitch:** A grumpy, book-hoarding dragon and his sarcastic intern solve a locked-room murder in a sun-drenched fantasy town where magic is for mending, not fighting.

**expanded_premise:** Cornelius Drake wants nothing more than to organize his library in peace. But Solterra Bay is a town of feuding Tile Families, gossip, and sticky pastries. When the famous author Fabrizio Lucchesi drops dead at the Mayor's Gala, Cornelius is the only one with the "Forensic Vision" to see the clues.
Partnered with Zeph, an intern whose migraines are actually a magical danger-sense, Cornelius must navigate a suspect list that includes Sirens, Gorgons, and Elves. He must prove that the "Obvious Suspect" (a Sphinx-kin ghostwriter) is innocent, catch the true killer, and learn that sometimes, trusting others is the only logical choice.

### unique_selling_points

**usp_1:** **The Protagonist:** A Dragon who is *not* a shape-shifter, *not* a giant monster, but a cat-sized intellectual who is physically vulnerable but mentally superior.

**usp_2:** **The Setting:** "Mediterranean Solarpunk." A fantasy world without "Dark Lords" or "War." The stakes are local, personal, and communal.

### themes

**primary_theme:** **Order vs. Community:** The tension between being "Right" (Logic/Cornelius) and being "Good" (Connection/Zeph).

**secondary_theme_1:** **The Value of the Outsider:** Cornelius and Valerian are "Other," but their unique perspectives solve the crime.

**secondary_theme_2:** **Legacy:** Zeph accepting his heritage; The Tile Families fighting over theirs.
