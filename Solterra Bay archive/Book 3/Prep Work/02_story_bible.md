# Story Bible: Solterra Bay Mystery
*Based on RDL v1.0 & NPE Module: Cozy Mystery v1.2*

## Story Overview

**Premise:** Cornelius Drake, a haughty, cat-sized "Library Dragon," wants nothing more than order. But when he is forced to attend the annual solterra gala at City Hall as a "Dignitary", and the famous author drops dead, Cornelius must solve the murder to clear the city's reputation (and get back to his books). He is aided by his Head Librarian Imelda and his intern Zeph, whose disastrous date with a tile heiress provides unexpected forensic advantages.

**Genre & Tone:** Cozy Fantasy Mystery.
*   *Tone:* Witty, sunny, warm. "Sherlock Holmes if he were a cat-sized dragon."
*   *Module Version:* COZY_MYSTERY v1.2.
*   *Aesthetic:* Solterra Sensory Signature (Heat, Light, Stone, Salt).

**Core Thematic Question:** Can Cornelius embrace the messiness of community (and caring for people) without losing his identity as a superior, detached dragon?

## World & Setting

**Primary Locations:**
*   **The Gala (City Hall):** The Crime Scene. A "Closed Circle" event. The Dragon is out of his element.
*   **The Library:** Sanctuary/HQ. (Cornelius wishes he was here).

**World Rules (Cozy Physics):**
*   **Magic:** Domestic only.
*   **Gossip Field:** Information travels instantly.
*   **Lethality:** Zero physical lethality (except the victim).

## Stakes & Promise

*   **Emotional Stakes:** Cornelius must choose between being "Right" and being "Good". Zeph risks losing Sophia's respect.
*   **External Stakes:** Justice for the murder; safety of the Gala guests.
*   **Winning Interaction:** At the climax (Act 4), Zeph feels a "Third Headache." Cornelius trusts this illogical signal immediately, setting the trap for the killer.
