## Chapter 03 State

**CHAPTER SUMMARY**
*   **Location:** City Hall (Sealed).
*   Theo Melas initiates Lockdown, barring the heavy oak doors.
*   Cornelius argues that locking a municipal building is "Political Suicide" (but admires the efficiency).
*   Guests are corralled in the Rotunda; VIPs moved to the Mayor's Reception Room.

**DECISIONS MADE**
*   **Theo:** Seals the exits despite the fire code/politics.
*   **Cornelius:** Claims the investigation (and the Mayor's Office) as his own.

**STATE CHANGES**
*   **Internal Axis (IA):** +2 -> +3.
*   **Relationship Axis (RA):** -4 -> -3.

    *   Theo V_Exhaustion: +7.
*   **Entropy:** 6 (Contained).
