STRUCTURAL STORY PLAN
PROJECT: Solterra Bay Book 5 - "The Great Solterra Bake-Off Mystery"

STRUCTURE OVERVIEW
- Preferred structure type: 4-Act Investigative Grid (Strict Cozy Mystery v1.2)

NARRATIVE PHASES

PHASE 1: THE PERFECT RECIPE (Setup)
- Function: Establish the "Status Quo" (Camp Joy) and then break it (Transformation).
- Dominant Axes: `V_Order` (Cornelius tries to maintain it) vs. `V_Chaos` (The Magic).
- Decisions: To hide the problem or call for help? (Decision: HIDE IT).

PHASE 2: THE HALF-BAKED THEORY (Investigation)
- Function: Pursuit of the wrong suspect (Zeno) while chaos escalates.
- Dominant Axes: `V_Ambition` (Zeph trying to fix it) vs. `V_Anxiety` (Cassius melting down).
- Decisions: To accuse Zeno? To trust the "science"?

PHASE 3: THE SOURDOUGH RISING (Crisis)
- Function: The "All is Lost" moment. Zeno is cleared (by becoming a donkey). The theory collapses. Time runs out.
- Dominant Axes: `External Axis` (Financial Ruin looms).
- Decisions: To cancel the Bake-Off?

PHASE 4: JUST DESSERTS (Resolution)
- Function: Confronting the true source (Pippa) and saving the day via Community.
- Dominant Axes: `Relationship Axis` (Cornelius embracing his flock).
- Decisions: To punish or to mentor?

CHAPTER FUNCTION OUTLINE

ACT 1: THE SETUP (Ch 1-5)
- Ch 1: The First Day. The Hike Inland. Arrival at **The Old Olive Press**. Intro Cornelius's annoyance at the primitive conditions. **Internal Question:** "Can I herd cats without eating them?" **Intro Lukas & Thais.**
- Ch 2: The Transformation. **Body Drop #1:** Lukas turns into a pigeon overnight. Panic in the dorms. **Intro Pippa & Zeno.**
- Ch 3: The Cover-Up. Detailed forensics on the cookie crumbs. No poison found. **Intro Kyria Varka & Vasilis.**
- Ch 4: Subplot (Zeph). Zeph tries to act cool, but the campers ignore him completely. He has zero authority. He realizes he can't be their "friend"—he has to lead.
- Ch 5: The Lockdown. A second camper (Generic Kid) turns into a Tortoise. Cornelius *tries* to arrest Zeno. Imelda intervenes. She reframes Cornelius's demand for a guard into a "Special Night Watch Honor" for Zeno. Zeno accepts the "Mission" enthusiastically. Cornelius is annoyed but gets his isolation result. **The Souffle Protocol** seals the exits.

ACT 2: THE INVESTIGATION (Ch 6-10)
- Ch 6: Interrogations (The "Flavor" Interviews). Cornelius interviews Thais (Secret Recipe?) and Vasilis (Why didn't you eat?).
- Ch 7: Subplot (Zeph). Zeph bonds with the "Animal" kids. They are happier as animals?
- Ch 8: Pinch Point #1. Little Kyria threatens to mail her "Weekly Report" to her Aunt early because of the "mess." Imelda/Zeno must prevent this letter from leaving the camp (The "Migrating Sourdough" incident intercepts the owl/messenger).
- Ch 9: The False Theory. Cornelius finds blue dye in Zeno's bunk. Matches the "Chaos" magic signature. "It's Zeno!"
- Ch 10: MIDPOINT. **Body Drop #2.** Zeno turns into a Donkey right in front of Cornelius. He logically cannot be the caster if he is the victim (or he backfired). Theory collapses.

ACT 3: THE CRUNCH (Ch 11-15)
- Ch 11: The Ticking Clock. The Town Calligrapher arrives to draft the formal invitations for the Bake-Off. Imelda and Cornelius must debate if they can postpone the event (suspicious) or must commit to the date (dangerous). They commit: 48 hours left.
- Ch 12: Regrouping. Re-interviewing Pippa. She seems "innocent" (just reading).
- Ch 13: Pinch Point #2 (Crisis). Unannounced parents arrive early! They see the chaos (Goats on roof). Imelda/Cornelius must convince them it's "Immersive Theater" while keeping them apart from their animal-children.
- Ch 14: Community Rally. Cassius breaks down. Imelda takes charge. Zeph organizes a "Petting Zoo" cover story as a backup.
- Ch 15: The Twist. Cornelius sees Pippa doodling in the sand/reading her book. He finally *listens* to the story she's been trying to tell him all week ("The Baker's Dozen Swans"). He realizes the transformations match the stories in her book exactly.

ACT 4: THE SHOWDOWN (Ch 16-20)
- Ch 16: The Hunt. Cornelius isolates the supply chain. It's not the flour, it's the sprinkles.
- Ch 17: The Epiphany. Cornelius slyly "interviews" Pippa's parents (under the guise of discussing Lukas's progress). He probes for family history and confirms dormant magical heritage (Nymph-touched?) without revealing the current disaster.
- Ch 18: The Confrontation. Cornelius gently confronts Pippa in the kitchen. She is midway through "enhancing" the final showstopper cake.
- Ch 19: The Reversal. Imelda/Cornelius admit the truth to Pippa's mother. The Mom helps! She talks Pippa down. They bake the "Reversal Cake" together, feeding it to the menagerie of children.
- Ch 20: The Bake-Off. Parents eat the cake. Kids turn back (mostly). A few feathers remain. Money saved.

DRAFTING STRATEGY
- Recommended drafting mode: Hybrid (Outline-first for plot, Discovery for comedy).
- Recommended next step: Begin Drafting Chapter 1.
