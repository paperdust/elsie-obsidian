# Chapter 3: The Cover-Up

**CONSISTENCY SCAN:**
*   **POV:** Cornelius.
*   **Forensics:** Comparing "Lawful" vs "Wild" Magic.
*   **Constraint:** Gentleness (Parents must not know).

**Narrative Summary:**
The camp must go on.
Cornelius sets up a lab in the kitchen.
He places two samples under the spectral array:
1.  **Control:** A crumb of the **Giggle-Glaze Donut** (Class Recipe).
2.  **Evidence:** A crumb found in Lukas's bed (Suspected Rogue Item).

**The Analysis:**
The Giggle-Glaze crumb glows **Bright Yellow** (Joy). It vibrates with a stable frequency.
The Evidence crumb looks identical... until Cornelius looks closer.
It glows **Iridescent** (Chaos). And it doesn't vibrate; it *hums* a complex melody.
*"This is not a cooking error,"* Cornelius concludes. *"The Giggle-Glaze was replaced. Someone swapped the sugar for... something structured."*

**The Red Herring:**
Zeno is found laughing near the barn. He admits to "pranking" the flour supply with extra yeast.
Cornelius tests the flour. It just makes the bread float higher. It does not turn children into pigeons.
Zeno is cleared of *this* specific mechanism, but remains a suspect for general chaos.

**Ending:**
Cornelius hides the pigeon-Lukas in the dovecote.
*"We have a mimic,"* he tells Imelda. *"Someone is copying our recipes but changing the spell."*
