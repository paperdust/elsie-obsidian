# Chapter 11: The Ticking Clock

**CONSISTENCY SCAN:**
*   **POV:** Cornelius.
*   **External Pressure:** The Calligrapher (World Bible: "Financial Stakes").
*   **Status:** Zeno is a Donkey.
*   **Constraint:** No Ozone.

**Narrative Summary:**
The camp is in chaos. Zeph is trying to keep "Donkey Zeno" calm in the barn.
Cornelius is in the library tent, trying to hyperventilate with dignity.
Imelda enters. *"The Calligrapher is here."*

**The Arrival:**
**Master Orestes** (Sphinx-kin, Truth-sense) arrives. He is here to scribe the formal invitations for the Sunday Bake-Off.
He sits at the desk, quill poised. *"The Mayor requires the final menu and the guest list. Is everything... satisfactory?"*
Cornelius starts to sweat. If he lies ("Everything is fine"), Orestes will sneeze (Truth-sense). If he tells the truth ("We are running a petting zoo of transformed children"), the camp is closed.

**The Gambit:**
Cornelius pivots. He uses "Technical Truth."
*"The menu is... evolving, Orestes. The children are deeply immersed in their... roles."*
Orestes's nose twitches but he doesn't sneeze.
Cornelius pushes the contract forward. *"Date confirmed. Sunday. Noon."*
Imelda signs it. The die is cast. 48 Hours remaining.

**The Consequence:**
Orestes leaves. Cornelius collapses in a chair.
*"We have 48 hours to reverse a Donkey, a Pigeon, a Turtle, and a Rabbit. Or we are ruined."*
Zeph enters (Cornelius sees him). Zeph looks haggard. *"Zeno wants hay. I think he's forgetting how to speak human."*

**Ending:**
Cornelius realizes the "Mind" of the victims is fading. The clock isn't just financial anymore; it's psychological.
