# Chapter 7: The Guardian (Subplot Deepening)

**CONSISTENCY SCAN:**
*   **POV:** Cornelius.
*   **Victim:** Bennie -> Rabbit.
*   **Link:** The Floaty-Loaf Wrapper.

**Narrative Summary:**
Cornelius spies on Zeph in the barn.
He sees the animals: Pigeon (Lukas), Tortoise (Maya).
And a new one: **A White Rabbit** (Bennie).
The Rabbit is bouncing off the walls, defying gravity slightly (Floaty-Loaf side effect).

**The Evidence:**
Cornelius waits for Zeph to leave, then sneaks in to inspect the Rabbit's pen.
In the bedding, he finds a wrapper: **"Cassius's Best Baguettes."**
He recognizes it. It's the wrapper from the bread he saw Bennie eating in Chapter 6.
*"The boy ate the re-heated bread,"* Cornelius mutters. *"And now he has the ears to match his hopping."*

**The Lodge Observation:**
Cornelius sketches the pattern.
Lukas (Donut) -> Pigeon.
Maya (Brownie) -> Turtle.
Bennie (Bread) -> Rabbit.
He moves to the Lodge to spy on Zeno and Zeph.
He hears Zeno say: *"Pippa was giving the Rabbit a 'good luck sprinkle'..."*
Cornelius stiffens. *"She was dusting the bread. I saw her."*
He pauses. *Is she the Mule? Or the Mastermind?*
He dismisses Mastermind. She is 7. She must be the unwitting carrier.

**Ending:**
Cornelius resolves to catch the person *giving* Pippa the supplies.
