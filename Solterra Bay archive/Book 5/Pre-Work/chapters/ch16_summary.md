# Chapter 16: The Hunt

**CONSISTENCY SCAN:**
*   **POV:** Cornelius.
*   **Constraint:** No accusation without proof.
*   **Magic:** Narrative Reality (Sprinkles as conduit).

**Narrative Summary:**
Cornelius leaves the library tent. It is 2 AM.
He needs to confirm the "Mechanism" before he confronts the "Caster."
He creeps into the kitchen (avoiding the sleeping Cassius).
He finds the **Sprinkle Supply**.
He takes a pinch. He whispers a test phrase: *"Be salt."*
The sprinkles remain sweet.
He tries again, focusing on the *intent* of a story. *"Once upon a time, this sugar was salt."*
The sprinkles shiver. He tastes one. **Salt.**

**The Confirmation:**
Cornelius spits it out.
*"They are Reagents,"* he whispers. *"Blank slates. They take on the flavor of the Narrative."*
It is not alchemy. It is **Bardic Magic**.
And Pippa is the only Bard in camp.

**The Complication:**
Cornelius realizes the "Final Feast" cake—the massive tiered focal point of the Bake-Off—is already frosted.
If Pippa reads the end of her story ("And the Kingdom flew away"), that cake becomes a Mass Levitation Device.
He has to stop the *Story*, not the baking.

**Ending:**
Cornelius retreats. He needs intel on the Bard's lineage to know how to counter it. He needs the Parents.
