# Chapter 10: Midpoint - The Donkey

**CONSISTENCY SCAN:**
*   **POV:** Cornelius.
*   **Victim:** Zeno -> Donkey.
*   **Trigger:** Cursed Mood-Muffin.
*   **Ethics:** Zeph Supervision.

**Narrative Summary:**
**The Confrontation:**
Cornelius accuses Zeno of "Tampering."
Zeno swallows the muffin. *"I was hungry! Dinner was six hours ago!"*
Cornelius: *"You were sneaking! A thief is a liar!"*

**The Defense:**
Imelda and Zeph arrive.
Zeph defends Zeno: *"He's a growing boy, Cornelius. He ate a stale muffin. That's not a crime."*
Imelda agrees, but chides Zeno: *"Sneaking is forbidden, Zeno. We have rules."*
**The Verdict:** Zeno must sleep in Zeph's room for supervision. "No more midnight snacks."

**The Night:**
Zeno sleeps in Zeph's room. He complains his stomach feels "heavy" (The muffin sitting like a brick).
Cornelius sleeps, confident that he has at least scared the "saboteur" straight.

**The Morning Twist:**
Cornelius is woken by Zeph.
He rushes to the room.
Zeno is a **Donkey**.
*The Logic:* Zeno ate a Mood-Muffin.
Normally, it changes color based on emotion.
But this one was corrupted by Pippa's story. It changed his *Form*.
*(Specific link: The Donkey Prince often ate food that transformed him).*

**The Realization:**
Cornelius stares.
*   *Fact:* I watched him eat it. It was a leftover from yesterday.
*   *Conclusion:* The *Entire Batch* from Chapter 6 was potentially compromised, or Pippa "sprinkled" the leftovers when no one was looking.
*   *Innocence:* Zeno is a victim.

**Act 2 Ends:**
The Detective froze the scene, but the crime happened anyway. The Investigation is dead.
