# Chapter 2: The Transformation

**CONSISTENCY SCAN:**
*   **POV:** Cornelius.
*   **Recipe:** Giggle-Glaze Donuts (Fun curriculum).
*   **Victim:** Lukas -> Pigeon.
*   **Prop:** "The Boy Who Flew" (Fable).

**Narrative Summary:**
**The Promise (Fun Magic):**
The camp opens with **Giggle-Glaze Donuts**. Cornelius watches as Cassius teaches the kids to whisk "Joy" into the icing.
It is a success.
*   **Zeno** eats a donut and laughs in a high-pitched, helium squeak for 60 seconds.
*   **Lukas** laughs so hard he floats three inches off the ground.
Cornelius smiles. *This is controlled chaos. This is safe.*
The kids are delighted. They feel *powerful*.

**The Pivot:**
That evening, while the happiness is still buzzing, Pippa tries to "help."
She sees Lukas sneaking leftover plain donuts.
*"Not plain,"* she whispers. *"Special."*
She adds her **Iridescent Sprinkles**, mimicking the class she just watched.

**The Body Drop:**
2 AM. Screams.
Cornelius rushes to the dorm.
Lukas's bed is empty. In his place is a **Pigeon**.
The bird coos frantically.
Cornelius finds the crumbs. They don't smell like Giggle-Glaze (Sugar/Vanilla). They smell like **Ozone-Free Magic** (Sea Salt and Old Paper).
The "Fun Magic" has been hijacked.

**Ending:**
Cornelius holds the pigeon. The contrast is stark: The donuts made them laugh. This made them *disappear*.
