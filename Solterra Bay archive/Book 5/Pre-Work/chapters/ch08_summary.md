# Chapter 8: The Sourdough Interception

**CONSISTENCY SCAN:**
*   **Little Kyria:** Orc (Phoenic heritage - "Obsessed with contracts/honor").
*   **Magic:** "The Migrating Sourdough" (Levitation/Expansion).
*   **Prop:** The Letter (Physical Evidene).

**Narrative Summary:**
**Pinch Point #1:** The Containment Field is breached.
Little Kyria has seen enough. She is sitting on the porch of the lodge, penning a formal "Report of Negligence" to her Aunt (The Councilwoman).
*"The sanitation is adequate, but the personnel are structurally unsound. Suggest immediate recall."*
She ties the letter to a rented Carrier Owl.

**The Crisis:**
If that bird flies, the camp is shut down.
It is **Cassius** who saves the day, accidentally.
He is "feeding" the Mother Dough in the kitchen. The heat (Entropy) causes the dough to **over-proof explosively**.
The massive blob of dough expands like a yeasty balloon, breaching the kitchen door and rolling into the common room.

**The Interception:**
The dough-blob engulfs the porch table where Kyria is standing. It hits the Carrier Owl cage. The owl is *not* harmed (Zero Lethality), but the cage is gummed shut by warm, sticky sourdough. The bird cannot fly.
Kyria is furious. *"This is a violation of the Courier Code!"*
Imelda arrives, suppressing a smile. *"A terrible accident, Kyria. We will scrape your letter clean... eventually."*

**The Aftermath:**
The letter is ruined. The owl is grounded.
But amidst the cleanup in the Common Room, Cornelius slips. He finds a **Blue Dye Packet** on the floor tiles, near the hearth where Zeno has been sitting. It must have fallen from his pocket.
Zeno jumps up to help clean. "I didn't drop that!"

**Ending:**
Cornelius holds the dye packet. "Got him."
