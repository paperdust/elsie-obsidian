# Chapter 4: Subplot (The Herder)

**CONSISTENCY SCAN:**
*   **POV:** Cornelius.
*   **Recipe:** Floaty-Loaves (Anti-gravity Baguettes).
*   **Zeph:** Lamassu-touched.

**Narrative Summary:**
**The Lesson (Fun Magic):**
Day 2 Class: **Floaty-Loaves**.
Role: To teach the dough to "Rise" literally.
Cornelius watches from the tent.
Thais gets it perfectly—her baguette drifts lazily at eye level.
Zeno over-charges his; it shoots into the sky like a rocket. The kids cheer!
It is *fun*.

**The Contrast:**
Zeph tries to corral the floating bread. The teens ignore him. They are playing fetch with baguettes.
It is chaos, but *happy* chaos.
Cornelius frowns. *"No discipline."*

**The Barn Scene:**
Cornelius follows Zeph to the barn.
He expects Zeph to be crying about the disrespect.
Instead, he sees Zeph using a **Floaty-Loaf** to lure the Pigeon-Lukas down from the rafters.
The bird wants the bread. Zeph hums. The bird lands.
Cornelius realizes: *The magic works on the victims too.*

**Ending:**
Zeph feeds the anti-gravity bread to the pigeon. The pigeon floats slightly. It coos happily.
Cornelius retreats. The "Fun Magic" is the only thing keeping the "Victim" calm.
