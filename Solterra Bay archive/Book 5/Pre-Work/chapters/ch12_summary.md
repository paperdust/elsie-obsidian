# Chapter 12: Regrouping

**CONSISTENCY SCAN:**
*   **POV:** Cornelius.
*   **Suspect:** Pippa (Latent Magic).
*   **Clue:** "Sprinkles" (RDL).

**Narrative Summary:**
Cornelius calls an emergency meeting (Cornelius, Imelda, Zeph, Cassius).
*"If Zeno is innocent, we have missed something fundamental."*
He lays out the evidence:
1.  **Sprinkles:** Found at every scene.
2.  **Smell:** Burnt Sugar (Not Ozone).
3.  **Proximity:** Who was near the ovens?

**The Pippa Interview:**
Cornelius suggests Pippa. *"She is always there."*
Zeph defends her immediately. *"She's seven! She just reads her book!"*
Cornelius insists on observing her.
He watches from the porch as Imelda talks to Pippa. Imelda is gentle.
*"Pippa, dear, did you bake anything special?"*
Pippa shakes her head. *"No, Miss Imelda. I only watch. And sprinkle the Luck."*
Cornelius watches Pippa's face. She looks genuinely confused. She doesn't *know* she's doing magic.
Cornelius sighs. *"Malice is absent. Capability seems absent. She is a child playing with glitter."*

**The Dead End:**
Cornelius strikes her from the list.
*"It must be external,"* he concludes. *"A rival bakery? Sabotage?"*
He decides to investigate **Little Kyria's** "Report" again. Maybe the Orcs are trying to shut them down?

**Ending:**
Cornelius walks away to interrogate Kyria. He leaves Pippa sitting on the steps, reading her book aloud to the empty air. He misses the words: *"And the baker made a dozen swans..."*
