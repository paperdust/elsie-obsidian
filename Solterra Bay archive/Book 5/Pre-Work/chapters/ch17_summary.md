# Chapter 17: The Epiphany

**CONSISTENCY SCAN:**
*   **POV:** Cornelius.
*   **Target:** Pippa's Parents (The "Civilians").
*   **Goal:** Confirm Nymph/Bard heritage.

**Narrative Summary:**
Morning. The Bake-Off is in 4 hours.
Cornelius intercepts Pippa's parents (The **Miller Family**) at the breakfast buffet.
He adopts his most charming mask. *"Your daughter has such a vivid imagination. A true... storyteller."*
Mrs. Miller laughs nervously. *"Oh, yes. She gets it from her grandmother. She was... eccentric. Used to claim she could sing the wheat into flour."*
Cornelius stills. *"Sing... the wheat?"*
*"Old country nonsense,"* Mr. Miller says. *"She was from the Nymph-Groves inside the Deep Woods. We don't hold with that superstition."*

**The Lock Click:**
Cornelius smiles. *"Of course. Superstition."*
He has it.
*   **Grandmother:** Dryad/Nymph heritage.
*   **Ability:** Sung Magic (Bardic).
*   **Skipped Generation:** The parents are Muggles. Pippa is the flair-up.
*   **Problem:** Pippa doesn't know she's doing it because her parents suppressed the "superstition."

**The Plan:**
He cannot just arrest Pippa. She is a magical nuke with no safety switch. If he scares her, she might accidentally narration-panic the whole camp into hamsters.
He needs a counter-narrative.

**Ending:**
Cornelius excuses himself. He runs to find Imelda.
*"We do not need a cage,"* he tells her. *"We need an Editor."*
