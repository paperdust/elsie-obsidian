# Chapter 14: The Community Rally

**CONSISTENCY SCAN:**
*   **POV:** Cornelius.
*   **Cassius:** Satyr-kin (Anxiety breakdown).
*   **Zeph:** Guardian Sense (Competence).

**Narrative Summary:**
**The Breakdown:**
Cornelius finds Cassius in the kitchen. The Satyr baker is weeping into a bowl of ganache.
*"I can't bake for them, Cornelius! My hands are shaking! The dough smells my fear!"*
Cornelius (usually haughty) realizes he cannot fix this with intellect. He needs **Heart**.
He puts a clawed hand on Cassius's shoulder. *"You are the hearth-keeper, Cassius. Just bake bread. I will handle the lies."*

**The Backup Plan:**
Zeph finds Cornelius. *"The animals are restless. They know the parents are here."*
Cornelius watches Zeph. The boy is calm, glowing with that faint bronze sheen.
*"If they escape,"* Zeph says, *"We call it a Petting Zoo. I can control them. I can make them... perform."*
Cornelius nods. He finally respects the intern. *"Do it. You are the Ringmaster now."*

**The Calm:**
Night falls. The parents are asleep. The camp is silent except for the weeping of the Baker and the shuffling of the Donkey.
Cornelius sits on the porch, exhausted. He feels... old.
He has failed to protect his hoard.

**Ending:**
He hears a small voice. Pippa is sitting on the step below him.
*"Mr. Cornelius? Can I read you a story?"*
Cornelius is too tired to say no. *"Fine, child. Read."*
