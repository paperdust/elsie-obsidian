# Chapter 13: The Early Parents (Pinch Point #2)

**CONSISTENCY SCAN:**
*   **POV:** Cornelius.
*   **Constraint:** "Parental Wrath Field" (Genre Module).
*   **Prop:** Transformed Children (Hidden).

**Narrative Summary:**
**The Crisis:**
A carriage rolls up the dusty track. It's **Mr. and Mrs. Doukas** (Tile Family Parents). They are 48 hours early.
*"We came to see Thais perform! We heard rumors of a play!"*

**The scramble:**
Cornelius watches from the window in horror. Thais is currently human, but **Maya (Tortoise)** and **Lukas (Pigeon)** are visible in the yard.
Imelda intercepts the parents. *"Welcome! You are... prompt!"*
Cornelius rushes to the yard. He has to hide the animals.
He sees Lukas (Pigeon) pecking at a crumb near the Doukas's carriage.
Mr. Doukas points. *"That pigeon is wearing a bandana. How quaint."*

**The "Immersive Theater" Lie:**
Cornelius steps in. *"Yes! It is part of the... Experience. 'Nature's Masquerade'. The children are... method acting. As animals."*
Mrs. Doukas looks skeptical. *"Where is Thais?"*
*"She is... meditating. In the root cellar. For the role of... The Seed."*
Cornelius is sweating. He herds the parents toward the Refreshment Tent, desperate to keep them away from the barn.

**The Close Call:**
Zeno-Donkey brays loudly from the enclosed paddock.
*"Is that my Zeno?"* Mrs. Doukas asks (she knows his voice?).
*"No!"* Cornelius yelps. *"That is... a local donkey. A tenor. Very loud."*

**Ending:**
The parents settle in the Guest Lodge. They aren't leaving. The camp is now a minefield. Any transformation in front of them is Game Over.
