# Chapter 15: The Twist

**CONSISTENCY SCAN:**
*   **POV:** Cornelius.
*   **Clue:** The Book of Fables (Source Material).
*   **Epiphany:** Cornelius uses "Pattern Recognition" (Draconian trait).

**Narrative Summary:**
Cornelius sits in the dark. Pippa reads by the light of his own faint breath-glow (he lights a small flame for her).
She reads *"The Baker's Dozen Swans."*
*"...and the Prince ate the crumb and became a bird,"* she reads.
Cornelius stiffens. *Lukas.*
*"...and the Knight ate the cake and became a beast of burden,"* she continues.
Cornelius blinks. *Zeno.*
*"...and the Lady ate the sweet and became a shell of herself."*
Cornelius whispers: *Maya the Turtle.*

**The Realization:**
Cornelius looks at the book.
*"Pippa,"* he asks, his voice trembling very slightly. *"What happens next in the story?"*
She turns the page. *"The Kingdom eats the feast, and they all fly away to the Moon."*
Cornelius looks at the kitchen, where Cassius is baking the huge, final feast cake.
If the parents eat that cake...

**The Conclusion:**
The magic isn't the sprinkles. It's the **Story**. Pippa is narrating reality. The sprinkles are just the ink she uses to write it.
She isn't reading what happened. She is **making it happen** by reading it.

**Act 3 Ends:**
Cornelius stands up. He knows the enemy. It is the sweet, seven-year-old girl sitting at his feet. And she is about to rewrite the entire town.
