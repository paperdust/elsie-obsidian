# Chapter 6: The "Flavor" Interviews

**CONSISTENCY SCAN:**
*   **POV:** Cornelius.
*   **Recipe:** Mood-Muffins (Interrogation) & Floaty-Loaves (Leftover).
*   **Victim Setup:** Bennie (Future Rabbit) & Zeno (Future Donkey).

**Narrative Summary:**
**The Interrogation (Mood-Muffins):**
Cornelius uses the Mood-Muffins to test Thais (Purple/Ambition) and Vasilis (Allergic/Grey).
**Pippa's Role:**
Cornelius sees Pippa "organizing" the muffin basket.
*"These are the rejects,"* she mutters. *"They need more happy thoughts."*
She sprinkles the basket liberally.
Cornelius ignores this. *"Good girl. Keep them tidy."*
(This plants the trap for Zeno later).

**The Side Scene (Bennie):**
While waiting for the next interview, Cornelius looks out the window.
**Bennie** (a shy kid) is crying because his **Floaty-Loaf** (from Ch 4) stopped floating.
Pippa pats his arm. *"Don't cry. I can fix it."*
She takes the stale baguette, whispers to it (Story Magic), and covers it in sprinkles.
*"Try it now,"* she says.
Bennie takes a bite. He smiles. The bread doesn't float, but *he* starts to hop slightly.
Cornelius notes: *"Sugar rush. Harmless."*

**Ending:**
Cornelius concludes the interviews. He thinks he has cleared the suspects. He does not realize he just watched Pippa arm two landmines (The Muffin Basket and Bennie's Bread).
