# Chapter 5: The Lockdown

**CONSISTENCY SCAN:**
*   **POV:** Cornelius.
*   **Recipe:** Sleepy-Time Squares (Chamomile Brownies).
*   **Victim:** Maya -> Tortoise.
*   **Fair Play:** Pippa frosts the specific brownie.

**Narrative Summary:**
**The Lesson (The Setup):**
Dinner dessert is **Sleepy-Time Squares**.
Cornelius watches the serving line.
**Pippa** is standing on a crate next to Cassius, helping.
*"Make them pretty, Pip,"* Cassius says.
Pippa nods. She takes a brownie, dips it in ganache, and then—right in front of Cornelius—gives it a massive shake of **Iridescent Sprinkles**.
*"For Maya,"* Pippa says happily. *"She's anxious."*
Cornelius smiles. *"Generous child."*
**Maya** takes the brownie. *"Thanks, Pip!"* She eats it in two bites.

**The Body Drop:**
10 PM. Scream.
Cornelius rushes to the Girls' Dorm.
Maya's bed is empty. A **Box Turtle** is hiding in her pillowcase.
Cornelius finds the plate. The sprinkles are gone.
*"She ate the Sleepy-Time Square,"* he notes. *"And now she is... hibernating."*

**The Arrest:**
Cornelius spots Zeno in the hallway (shadows).
*"You! You were near the dessert tray!"* (Cornelius saw Zeno grab seconds, ignoring Pippa's role).
Cornelius attempts arrest. Imelda intervenes.
Zeno becomes **Hall Monitor**.

**Ending:**
Cornelius tucks Pippa in. He saw her make the weapon, but he only saw "decoration."
