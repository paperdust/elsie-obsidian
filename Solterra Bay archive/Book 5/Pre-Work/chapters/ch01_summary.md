# Chapter 1: The First Day

**CONSISTENCY SCAN:**
*   **Cornelius:** World Bible check -> "Large house cat size", "Pencil-thin blue flame", "Hates loud noises".
*   **Zeph:** World Bible check -> "Lanky", "Bronze sheen to hair".
*   **Prop:** "Book of Fables" (Story Bible) -> Present with Pippa.
*   **Tone:** Cozy/Comedy.

**Narrative Summary:**
The hike to The Old Olive Press is a sweaty ordeal. Cornelius riding atop a crate of books, complains that the humidity will warp the bindings. Zephyr "Zeph" Taraki, his hair gleaming with that strange metallic bronze sheen in the sunlight, tries to keep morale up, but the teenagers ignore him.

The arrival establishes the chaos. **Thais** (House Kallistos heir) immediately critiques the architecture. **Little Kyria** (Orc) starts a notebook titled "Health Code Violations." **Zeno** (Satyr-kin) bounds around on his goat legs, vibrating with energy.

**The Inciting Friction:**
At the opening circle, Imelda speaks of unity. Cassius speaks of yeast. Zeph tries to lead a game. It dissolves instantly. Zeno throws a lump of raw dough. It hits Cornelius.
Cornelius's dragon instincts flare. He rears up, eyes flashing gold, and inhales sharply. He unleashes his **breath weapon**—not a war-blast, but the precise, pencil-thin jet of intense blue flame he uses for soldering. ideally, it should have incinerated the dough mid-air. Instead, against the chaotic wind of the camp, it merely fizzles out like a damp firework. Zeno laughs, "Nice trick, lizard-man!"
Cornelius is humiliated. His biological superiority is useless here. He retreats.

**The Setup:**
That evening, while Imelda and the staff are distracted by logistics, Pippa sits alone. She is reading *Grimm-style Fables*. She carefully places **glittery, iridescent sprinkles** (which she brought herself) onto a tray of cookies, whispering the story of "The Boy Who Flew." Lukas, hungry and bored, snatches a cookie. He eats it.

**Ending:**
Cornelius locks the library tent. He is secure. He assumes the children are equally contained. He is wrong.
