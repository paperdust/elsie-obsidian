# Chapter 18: The Confrontation

**CONSISTENCY SCAN:**
*   **POV:** Cornelius.
*   **Constraint:** Zero Lethality/Gentleness with Child.
*   **Setting:** The Kitchen (The Lab).

**Narrative Summary:**
Cornelius enters the kitchen. It is bustling. Imelda and Cassius are prepping the final trays.
Pippa is sitting under the prep table, book open. She has a shaker of sprinkles.
Cornelius sits on the floor. Eye level.
*"Hello, Pippa."*
She jumps. *"Mr. Cornelius! I was just... checking the story."*

**The Talk:**
*"It is a powerful story,"* Cornelius says softly. *"But I think you are reading it too loud."*
Pippa frowns. *"I'm reading in my head."*
*"Your head is very loud,"* Cornelius says. *"Detailed. Like your Grandmother's singing."*
Pippa's eyes go wide. *"You know Nana?"*
*"I know magic,"* he corrects. *"Look."*
He points to Lukas-Pigeon in the rafters. *"Read the part about the bird turning back into a boy."*
Pippa looks at her book. *"There isn't a part like that. The story ends with them flying away."*
*"Then we have a problem,"* Cornelius says. *"Because my friend Lukas does not want to fly away. He wants to have warm milk and sleep in a bed."*

**The Turning Point:**
Pippa looks at the Pigeon. She looks at Cornelius. The realization hits her. She starts to cry.
*"I didn't mean to! I just wanted to be... special."*
The air pressure drops (Magic Panic). The sprinkles in her hand start to glow red.
Cornelius realizes he pushed too hard.

**Ending:**
Mrs. Miller (The Mom) enters the kitchen, looking for coffee. She sees the glowing sprinkles. She sees her crying daughter.
She drops her mug. *Shatter.*
