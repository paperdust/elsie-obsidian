**Narrative Summary:**
**The Event:**
The Parents are seated on the lawn. The judges (Town Elders) act serious.
The "Campers" march out with their trays.
They look a bit disheveled—hair messy, clothes slightly stretched or loose—but they are smiling.
Zeno presents the "Sourdough Sculptures." They are lumpy, but he sells it. *"Rustic charm!"*

**The Presentation:**
Pippa presents the final cupcakes (non-magical).
Mrs. Miller watches from the side, holding Cornelius's arm.
*"She will need training,"* Cornelius murmurs.
*"She will get it,"* Mrs. Miller vows. *"No more secrets."*

**The Verdict:**
The Judges are impressed by the "Creative Energy."
The Camp is declared a success. The Library Grants are approved.
Imelda faints gracefully into a chair. *"Success."*

**The Aftermath:**
Sunset. The parents leave with their children.
Zeno waves goodbye to Zeph. *"Best summer ever. I was a donkey!"*
Cornelius sits on the porch. He lights his pipe (a small puff of smoke).
Zeph sits next to him.
*"We did it, sir."*
Cornelius looks at the empty campground.
*"We survived it, Zeph. There is a difference."*
But he smiles. Just a little.

**THE END.**
