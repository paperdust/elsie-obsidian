# Chapter 19: The Reversal

**CONSISTENCY SCAN:**
*   **POV:** Cornelius.
*   **Solution:** Positive/Prestigious (The Reversal Cake).
*   **Participation:** Community (Mom + Imelda + Cornelius).

**Narrative Summary:**
**The Revelation:**
Mrs. Miller stares at the red glow. *"Nana's light,"* she whispers.
She doesn't scream. She runs to Pippa and hugs her. *"I'm sorry, baby. I told you it wasn't real. I was wrong."*
The red glow fades to pink. The panic subsides. (Love > Fear).

**The Solution:**
Cornelius stands up. *"We have one hour. We need a new ending."*
He hands Pippa a quill. *"Write it. 'The children ate the cake and remembered they were children'."*
Pippa writes it in the book.
Imelda grabs the mixing bowl. *"But we need a vehicle. A cake that tastes like... grounding. Roots. Home."*
Mrs. Miller rolls up her sleeves. *"Carrot Cake. With heavy cream cheese frosting. Nana's recipe."*

**The Team-Up:**
They bake. It is a frantic, magical montage.
*   **Cornelius** regulates the oven temperature with his breath.
*   **Cassius** kneads the dough.
*   **Pippa** sprinkles the "Edit" into the batter.
*   **Mrs. Miller** stirs with the force of a mother reclaiming her child.

**The Result:**
The "Reversal Cake" comes out. It is ugly but smells like safety.
They crumble it up.
*"Feeding time,"* Cornelius says.

**The Action:**
Zeph herds the animals into the kitchen.
Donkey-Zeno eats a piece. *POOF.* Zeno (human) is back, still wearing the stretched night-shirt.
Pigeon-Lukas eats a crumb. *POOF.* Lukas is back.
They move down the line. It works.

**Ending:**
The kitchen is full of naked/ragged children. Imelda throws aprons at them.
*"Get dressed! The judges are here!"*
