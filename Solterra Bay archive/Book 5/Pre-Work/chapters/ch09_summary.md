# Chapter 9: The Blue Evidence

**CONSISTENCY SCAN:**
*   **POV:** Cornelius.
*   **Prop:** Blue Dye Packet.
*   **Constraint:** Indoor Motive.

**Narrative Summary:**
Cornelius slams the **Blue Dye Packet** on the table.
*"It is Zeno. He has the motive and the access."*
Zeph objects. Cornelius dismisses him.

**The Observation:**
Cornelius shadows Zeph, witnesses the argument with Pippa ("Stories aren't real"), and resolves to end this tonight.

**The Stakeout:**
Cornelius reasons: *"He lost his dye, but he will try again. He will target the supplies for tomorrow."*
Cornelius hides in the kitchen pantry.
He waits in the dark, watching the prep tables.
On the counter sits a basket of **Leftover Mood-Muffins** (from Chapter 6).

**The Ambush:**
2 AM. The door creaks.
Zeno creeps in. He looks around nervously.
He approaches the ingredient bins... but walks past them.
He goes to the muffin basket. He grabs two stale Mood-Muffins and stuffs them into his mouth.
Cornelius leaps out! *"Aha! Destroying the evidence?"*

**Ending:**
Zeno chokes on the muffin. Cornelius has him cornered.
