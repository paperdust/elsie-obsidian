# Analysis: Book 5 Mechanics vs. Genre Module

## 1. Compliance Checklist
*   [x] **Lethality (Physical):** 0.0. Transformation prevents death/injury constraints. *Note: Transformation must be depicted as painless/confusing, not agonizing.*
*   [x] **Lethality (Social):** High. The "Parental Wrath" field aligns perfectly with the 1.5 coefficient.
*   [x] **Elasticity:** 0.95. "Benign Residuals" (feathers/fur) are a minor violation but acceptable as "Series Texture." They do not break the "recognizable status quo."
*   [x] **Suspect Pool Topology:** **PASS (Corrected).**
    *   *Module Requirement:* 6 Suspects (A-F).
    *   *Current State:* 6 Suspects.
        *   Suspect A: Lukas (Victim)
        *   Suspect B: Thais (Overachiever)
        *   Suspect C: Pippa (Culprit/Hidden)
        *   Suspect D: Zeno (False Target)
        *   Suspect E: Kyria Varka (Rival)
        *   Suspect F: Vasilis (Red Herring)

## 2. Logic Gaps & Fixes
*   **The "Access" Problem:**
    *   *Issue:* How does Pippa apply the magic?
    *   *Fix:* Pippa is the "Official Decorator."
*   **The "Overnight" Constraint vs. Causality:**
    *   *Decision:* The magic binds during digestion/sleep, creating a time delay that obfuscates the cause.

## 3. Structural Contradictions
*   **Ch 2 Body Drop:**
    *   *Module:* Body Drop #1 (Suspect A dies).
    *   *Book 5:* Suspect A (Lukas) turns into a Pigeon.
    *   *Alignment:* This works. The "Death" is "Loss of Humanity."

## 4. Final Verification
*   **The Calligrapher Twist (Ch 11):** Replaces the "Letter" constraint, adding immediate social pressure.
*   **The Reversal (Ch 19):** Involves Pippa's mother (Community Rally Attractor D), fulfilling the genre requirement for community-based resolution.
