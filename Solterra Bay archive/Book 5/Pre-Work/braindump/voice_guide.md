# Solterra Bay Voice & Tone Guide
*Updated for the 2026 "Mature Cozy" Market*

## 1. The Solterra Sensory Signature
Unlike the "rainy coffee shop" standard of early 2020s cozy fantasy, Solterra Bay is defined by **Heat, Light, and Stone.**

### The "Sun-Baked" Palette
Every scene should anchor the reader in the physical reality of the Mediterranean coast using these three primary elements:
1.  **Golden Hour:** The light is substantial. It gilds the dust motes in the library, turns the limestone walls honey-colored, and blinds you at noon.
2.  **The Stone:** The town is built of it. It retains heat at night (warm underfoot), echoes with footsteps (verticality), and feels cool inside the thick-walled library.
3.  **The Salt:** It's in the air, on the skin, and crusting the windows. It flavors the food and ruins the book bindings.

### The "Cozy" Promise (2026 Standard)
*   **Competence Porn:** We watch people be *good* at things. Imelda repairing a binding, Cassius baking bread, Zeph organizing a shelf. The pleasure comes from watching skilled labor.
*   **Soft Power:** Heroism is rarely about combat. It is about **Mending** (fixing what is broken), **Hosting** (feeding/sheltering others), and **Listening** (understanding the truth behind the lie).
*   **Safety w/ Stakes:** The stakes are personal (loss of the library, family reputation), but the *physical* safety of the reader is respected. No graphic violence.

## 2. Character Filters (Worldviews)
Instead of "keywords," we use filters. This is how the character *perceives* the world.

### Cornelius Drake (The Perspective)
*   **The Filter:** **Hoard Logic & Preservation.**
*   **How he sees the world:** Everything is either "Efficient" or "Disorderly." He views the library not just as a workplace, but as his biology—a missing book is a missing tooth. He is constantly assessing threats to the collection (humidity, silverfish, sticky-fingered children).
*   **The Voice:** Precise, antiquated, fastidious. He does not use contractions in narration. He dignifies his grumpiness with high vocabulary.
*   **The Contrast:** He describes his affection as "efficiency." (e.g., "I saved the intern because finding a replacement would be administratively burdensome.")

### Imelda Kassiani (The Anchor)
*   **The Filter:** **Deep Time.**
*   **How she sees the world:** She is 187 years old. She has seen this crisis before. She has seen this mayor's grandfather make the same mistake. She is unshakeable because she sees the long arc.
*   **The Voice:** Warm, brief, amused. She rarely explains herself because she doesn't need to. She is the only one who speaks to Cornelius like he is a pet/child.

### Zephyr "Zeph" Taraki (The Foil)
*   **The Filter:** **Defensive Irony melting into Wonder.**
*   **How he sees the world:** Initially: "This is lame/weird/work." He uses sarcasm to protect himself from looking naive. As the series progresses: He begins to see the magic *through* the dust.
*   **The Voice:** Modern (but timeless—no slang that will date). He asks the practical questions the reader is thinking ("Why don't we just lock the door?").

## 3. Narrative Guardrails

### What to Avoid
*   **Gamified Mechanics:** Do not list "Sense Rolls" or mechanical limits. Logic flows from biology/physics, not a rulebook.
*   **Generic Fantasy:** This is not "Medieval Europe." There are no taverns with "stew" unless it's *kakavia* fish soup. There are no "inns" unless they are sea-side guest houses. Keep the cultural flavor specific.
*   **Cynicism:** Characters can be tired (Theo) or grumpy (Cornelius), but the universe itself is kind. Good deeds are rewarded. Communication solves problems.

## 4. Example: The "Solterra" Rewrite

*   **Generic:** "The library was quiet. Cornelius sat on his cushion and looked at the door, waiting for Zeph."
*   **Solterra:** "The afternoon heat had finally broken, leaving the library air heavy with the scent of cooling paper and dust. Cornelius adjusted his spectacles. The silence was absolute—a perfect, efficient silence—until the heavy oak door groaned open, letting in a blinding slice of harbor light and the intern."
