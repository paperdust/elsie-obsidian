# Book 5 Brainstorming: The Magic Baking Camp

## Premise
- **Setting:** Joint summer camp hosted by the Library (Cornelius/Zeph) and the Bakery (Cassius/Elpida).
- **Core Activity:** A "Baking & Bookbinding" camp? Or just Magic Baking?
- **Participants:** Teenagers (Campers).
- **Magic System:** "Small Spells" via baked goods.
    - *Examples:* Mood Muffins, Imagination Bread.
- **Vibe:** Summer heat, flour clouds, teenage angst, low-stakes magic going wrong. High comedy.

## The Cozy Mystery Elements
- **The Crime:** Campers are turning into animals (pigeons, goats, fish) after eating snacks.
    - *Constraint 1:* They are NOT fun talking animals. Just regular, confused animals.
    - *Constraint 2:* The transformation happens **overnight**. They eat the snack, go to sleep, and wake up as animals. This delays the reaction and obscures the cause.
- **The Ticking Clock:** The Great Bake-Off (End of Week). Parents are coming. The kids must be human by then.
- **The Stakes:** Financial Ruin. The camp is a major income source. Refunds or temple fees for decursing would bankrupt the library.
- **The Roles:**
    - *Library (Imelda/Zeph/Cornelius):* Instruction & Spellbooks.
    - *Bakery (Cassius/Elpida):* Ingredients & Ovens (Voluntary contribution).

## The Solution (The "Truth")
- **The Culprit:** A younger sibling of a camper (The "Tag-along").
- **The Mechanism:** "Enchanted Sprinkles." The kid is reading a fable (likely *Circe* or similar), mimicking the spells, and accidentally imbuing sprinkles with actual awakened magic.
- **The Intent:** Innocent/Accidental. They don't realize it's real. They think they are just playing.



## Key Themes
- Mentorship vs. Independence.
- "Don't play with your food" (literally).
