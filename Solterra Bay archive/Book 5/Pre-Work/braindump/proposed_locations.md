## Camp Name Suggestions

**Olive-Related:**
*   **Camp Olea** (Scientific name for Olive). Simple, classic.
*   **Camp Verdant** (Green/Growth).
*   **Camp Oleander** (A bit poisonous, maybe not?).
*   **The Grove of Whispers** (Too ominous?).

**Reading/Story-Related:**
*   **Camp Codex** (Book-themed).
*   **Camp Fable** (Fits the magic system perfectly).
*   **Camp Storybook** (A bit literal).
*   **The Chapter House** (Sounds like a monastery).

**Hybrid Suggestion:**
*   **Camp Fable-Grove**
*   **Camp Olea-Script**

*Recommendation:* **Camp Fable** fits the plot perfectly (Fables coming true), but **Camp Olea** fits the setting. Let's try **Camp Olea** for the "Olive Press" connection, or **Camp Fable** for the "Magic" connection. 

*Selected Placeholder for now:* **Camp Olea** (It sounds like a real place in Solterra Bay).

## Location Descriptions

### primary_location

**location_name:** **Camp Olea** (The Old Olive Press)

**location_type:** Seasonal Summer Camp (Ancient Olive Grove).

**atmosphere:** Ancient, sun-drenched, and humming with life. A "Secret Garden" of gnarled olive trees and wild herbs. It feels like a place where time moves slower.

**sensory_details:** The air is thick with the scent of crushed oregano, sun-baked earth, and sweet dough. The soundscape is wind rustling through silver olive leaves and the distant crash of the sea below. Visually, it is a palette of sage green, terracotta, and blinding white stone.

**key_features:** The Great Olive Grove (The Path), The Pergola (The Kitchen), The Sanctuary Barn (The Menagerie), The Stone Villa (The Lodge).

**significance_to_story:** A "Safe Harbor" that becomes a "Locked Room." The isolation, meant for focus, traps the magic inside.

#### camp_olea_sub_locations

**sub_location_1:** **The Grove Path:**
The only way in or out. A winding dirt track through a forest of massive, twisted olive trees that are centuries old. Their roots act like natural stairs. The canopy is dense, creating a tunnel of dappled light that separates the camp from the "Real World" of the town.

**sub_location_2:** **The Pergola (The Kitchen):**
The heart of the camp. A massive open-air stone patio shaded by a thick tangle of ancient grapevines. The centerpiece is the "Old Press"—not a machine, but a monumental circular stone slab, cool and smooth, perfect for kneading dough. Beehive clay ovens line the perimeter, radiating gentle warmth.

**sub_location_3:** **The Sanctuary Barn (The Menagerie):**
A soaring wooden structure that smells of sweet Timothy hay, dried lavender, and old wood. It is *not* a prison; it is a "Sleepover Fort." Soft stalls are filled with fresh straw and pillows. Sunlight streams through the slat walls. It is a place of rest for the transformed children (The Donkey, The Rabbit).

**sub_location_4:** **The Treehouse Cabins (The Hives):**
Twelve small, triangular wooden cabins built on stilts among the olive branches. They are connected by swinging bridges and ladder-stairs. They feel like nests, safe and elevated.

**sub_location_5:** **The Stone Villa (The Lodge):**
The original farmhouse. Crumbling pink plaster, cool terracotta floors, and shutters painted faded blue. It serves as the Staff HQ and Library. A place of cool shadows and mint tea, where Cornelius retreats from the sun.
