REQUIRED DATA LAYER
RDL_VERSION: 1.1
SOURCE: Normalized from user brainstorming (Book 5) & Refined Plan

CANON FACTS
(Explicit statements that must not change later)
- Timeframe: Book 5 in the series.
- Setting: A "Magic Baking" Summer Camp hosted at **The Old Olive Press**, a rustic site two hours inland from Solterra Bay. (Isolated).
- Key Roles: Cornelius and Zeph (Library staff/Instructors), Cassius and Elpida (Bakery staff/Suppliers), Imelda (Administrator).
- The Event: A one-week camp culminating in a "Great Solterra Bake-Off" for parents and town elders.
- THE CRIME: Campers are transforming into non-talking animals (pigeons, goats, fish etc.) after eating camp snacks.
- THE CONSTRAINT: The transformation manifests **overnight**. Victims go to sleep human and wake up as animals.
- **ETHICAL CONSTRAINT:** No distraction may damage the Library/Bakery reputation (e.g., no fake plagues). No camper may be physically endangered or imprisoned (e.g., no locking kids in sheds). Solutions must be **Positive/Prestigous**.
- THE CAUSE: Magic-infused sprinkles created accidentally by **Pippa** (Lukas's sister).
- **WRITING CONSTRAINT:** The word "Ozone" is BANNED. Magic must smell like ingredients (sugar, yeast, lemon) or nature (sea, rain). Never ozone.
- THE EPIPHANY: Pippa has **Latent Magical Heritage** (Nymph-touched) manifesting early, powering her playful mimicry of spells from her **Book of Fables**.
- **FAIR PLAY CLUE:** Pippa repeatedly tries to read stories to the staff/older kids about "The Boy Who Became A Bird" etc., but is ignored or shushed because they are "too busy."

SOFT PREFERENCES
(Strong author intent, flexible if needed)
- Tone: High Comedy, Cozy Chaos.
- Focus: Cornelius trying to herd animal-children is a key visual/comedic anchor.
- Stakes: Financial. The Library needs the camp income. **The Calligrapher** arrives in Ch 11 to force a deadline commit.

OPEN QUESTIONS / AMBIGUITIES
(Unresolved, contradictory, or missing elements)
- Specific animal list (flexible for comedy).

BOOK-LEVEL DATA

- Tone / emotional register: Lighthearted, frantic, "Summer Camp Gone Wrong".
- Central tension: Order (Cornelius/Imelda) vs. Chaos (Accidental Magic/Puberty).
