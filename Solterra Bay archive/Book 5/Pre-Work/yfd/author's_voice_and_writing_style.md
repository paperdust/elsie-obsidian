### reader_experience_goal

**reader_experience_goal:** Readers should feel the safety of the library and the thrill of the puzzle. The story blends a murder mystery with the comfort of a slice-of-life fantasy. The world should feel ancient and solid, full of stone, books, and quiet corners, creating a sense of "hygge" without focusing on the weather outside.

### overall_story_pov

**narration_style:** Third Person Limited, strictly anchored to Cornelius Drake. The narrative voice acts as a filter of "fussy intellect," interpreting the surroundings through the lens of a fastidious, inventory-obsessed dragon.

**story_type:** A linear mystery investigation mixed with "slice of life" moments. The pacing allows for quiet scenes—drinking tea, mending books, complaining about dust—that are just as important as finding clues.

**pov_approach:** Internal thoughts are crucial. Cornelius's POV should reveal his high-strung nature, his hidden soft spot for his friends, and his need for order.

**deep_pov:** Filter the world through Cornelius's logic and physical senses. Focus on tactile feelings—the texture of paper or the "prickle" of disorder. Do not describe smells unless they are specific clues (like chemicals) or part of a meal being eaten.

### baseline_prose_style

**clarity_and_conciseness:** Prose should be clear and precise to match Cornelius’s voice. Use simple, direct language for action. Ensure the reading level remains accessible (8th grade or lower).

**description_approach:** Emphasize the texture of the world: stone, paper, ink, and tools. Do not mention sunlight or the weather. Focus on concrete details. Only mention smells if they are vital clues or involve food being served.

**dialogue_style:** High contrast drives the humor. Cornelius speaks in complete, formal sentences with no contractions; Zeph uses casual slang.

**sentence_structure_variety:** Mix short sentences for actions with slightly longer ones for Cornelius’s thoughts. Avoid complex or confusing sentence structures.

**verb_choice:** Use active verbs that show order and control (sorted, placed, fixed) for Cornelius.

**pacing:** Move naturally between the mystery and daily life. Do not slow down for long atmospheric descriptions unless they contain clues.

**diversify_vocabulary_and_avoid_predictable_phrasing:** Use specific words for library items (shelf, index, scroll) and the setting (tiles, stone). Avoid overly difficult words; keep the language simple but specific.

**engagement_priority:** Every scene should involve a deduction, a character moment, or an action. Avoid static descriptions of the room or area.

**stylized_language_control:** Cornelius can treat small messes like huge disasters. Use dramatic but simple language for his reactions to disorder.

**style_reference:** Follow Chicago Manual of Style.

**punctuation_preference:** Standard punctuation; use em-dashes for Cornelius's extra thoughts or interruptions.

### core_voice_and_emotion

**voice_authenticity:** Cornelius sounds like a fussy academic. Zeph sounds like a regular teenager. Their voices must stay distinct.

**emotion_rendering:** Show emotion through physical actions. Cornelius might preen his scales when happy or go still when focused. Zeph might fidgit when nervous.

**flaws_and_growth:** Cornelius's need for order is both funny and a problem he must overcome. Zeph grows by becoming more confident. Show this through their actions.

**descriptor_cap:** No descriptor (adjective, phrase, or metaphor) may appear more than three times per manuscript.

### writing_limitations_and_goals

**avoid_clichés:** Avoid dark or gritty fantasy tropes. The villain is a criminal, not a monster.

**vivid_language:** Use strong, simple sensory words (crisp, dusty, silent, savory). Avoid describing light or air.

**emotional_clarity:** Slow down at key emotional moments to make sure the reader feels the connection between characters.

**internal_consistency:** Cornelius must always act like a dragon who loves order. His logic always serves his collection.

**show_don’t_tell:** Show affection through actions, like sharing food or protecting someone, rather than just saying it.

**strong_prose:** Keep the writing tight. Remove extra words that do not add meaning.

### scene_and_chapter_dynamics

**scene_opening:** Open every scene *in media res*—start in the middle of dialogue or action. Do not describe the sunlight, weather, or time of day. Establish the scene through immediate character interaction.

**scene_closure:** End on a clue, a choice, or a realization. Every scene should move the story or character arc forward.

**single_pov_per_scene:** One POV per scene/chapter (Cornelius).

**transition_handling:** Use clear breaks between scenes. Mark changes in location with immediate action in the new setting.
