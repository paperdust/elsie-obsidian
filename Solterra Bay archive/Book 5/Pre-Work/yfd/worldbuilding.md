**overview_setting_summary:** Solterra Bay is a vibrant, vertical coastal town built into a cliffside, characterized by heated stone stairs, intricate ceramic tile-work, and a diverse population of Humans, Elves, Orcs, and Mythological Kin (Satyrs, Gorgons, sirens). The setting blends "Antiquity" aesthetics (togas/tunics, olive oil lamps) with specific fantasy elements (Centaur couriers, Dragon librarians). The atmosphere is "Cozy but Chaotic"—gossip travels faster than magic, and social standing is determined by Tile Family allegiance and the quality of one's olive oil.

### key_world_details

**key_world_detail_1:** **Integrated Mythology:** Mythological species (Satyrs, Gorgons, Sirens) are not monsters but citizens with jobs. Sirens are fishermen, Gorgons are architects, Satyrs are bakers.

**key_world_detail_2:** **The Tile Families:** The local economy and politics are dominated by three rival ceramic guilds (Kallistos, Doukas, Veneti), whose feuds are the town's primary source of drama.

**key_world_detail_3:** **Domestic Magic:** Magic is "Cozy" and functional—mending pots, cooling ice-boxes, healing bones—rather than combat-oriented. "High Magic" (fireballs) is rare and considered rude.

**key_world_detail_4:** **The Library Dragon:** Library Dragons (*Draco bibliotheca*) are cat-sized bonded guardians of knowledge, serving as the town's archivists and unofficial detectives.

**key_world_detail_5:** **Cuisine:** Food is central to culture. Meals are communal rituals (grilled fish on the seawall, slow-cooked chickpea stews), and hospitality is mandatory (Spoon Sweets for guests).

### key_world_rules

**key_world_rule_1:** **Magic Leaves a Trace:** Magic (especially Bardic or Alchemical) leaves forensic evidence (residue, smell, behavioral ticks) that can be analyzed.

**key_world_rule_2:** **Healing Has Limits:** Magical healing accelerates natural recovery but cannot resurrect the dead, regrow severed limbs, or cure old age.

**key_world_rule_3:** **Fair Play Biology:** Species traits are consistent (Satyrs jump high, Sirens hold breath), and mysteries must be solvable using these known biological rules.

**key_world_rule_4:** **No Ozone:** Magic smells like its components (herbs, salt, metal, sugar), never generic "ozone" or "energy."

**key_world_rule_5:** **Narrative Physics (Book 5 Specific):** In this specific story, magic follows the rules of "Fables"—reality bends to match the structure of the story being told (e.g., eating a crumb turns you into a pigeon if the story says so).

### setting

#### primary_location

**location_name:** **Camp Olea** (The Old Olive Press)

**location_type:** Seasonal Summer Camp (Ancient Olive Grove).

**atmosphere:** Ancient, sun-drenched, and humming with life. A "Secret Garden" of gnarled olive trees and wild herbs. It feels like a place where time moves slower.

**sensory_details:** The air is thick with the scent of crushed oregano, sun-baked earth, and sweet dough. The soundscape is wind rustling through silver olive leaves and the distant crash of the sea below. Visually, it is a palette of sage green, terracotta, and blinding white stone.

**key_features:** The Great Olive Grove (The Path), The Pergola (The Kitchen), The Sanctuary Barn (The Menagerie), The Stone Villa (The Lodge).

**significance_to_story:** A "Safe Harbor" that becomes a "Locked Room." The isolation, meant for focus, traps the magic inside.

#### camp_olea_sub_locations

**sub_location_1:** **The Grove Path:** The only way in or out. A winding dirt track through a forest of massive, twisted olive trees that are centuries old. Their roots act like natural stairs. The canopy is dense, creating a tunnel of dappled light that separates the camp from the "Real World" of the town.

**sub_location_2:** **The Pergola (The Kitchen):** A massive open-air stone patio shaded by a thick tangle of ancient grapevines. The centerpiece is the "Old Press"—not a machine, but a monumental circular stone slab, cool and smooth, perfect for kneading dough. Beehive clay ovens line the perimeter, radiating gentle warmth.

**sub_location_3:** **The Sanctuary Barn (The Menagerie):** A soaring wooden structure that smells of sweet Timothy hay, dried lavender, and old wood. It is *not* a prison; it is a "Sleepover Fort." Soft stalls are filled with fresh straw and pillows. Sunlight streams through the slat walls. It is a place of rest for the transformed children (The Donkey, The Rabbit).

**sub_location_4:** **The Treehouse Cabins (The Hives):** Twelve small, triangular wooden cabins built on stilts among the olive branches. They are connected by swinging bridges and ladder-stairs. They feel like nests, safe and elevated.

**sub_location_5:** **The Stone Villa (The Lodge):** The original farmhouse. Crumbling pink plaster, cool terracotta floors, and shutters painted faded blue. It serves as the Staff HQ and Library. A place of cool shadows and mint tea, where Cornelius retreats from the sun.

#### additional_location_1

**location_name:** The Solterra Bay Library (The Hub)

**location_type:** Public Institution / Sanctuary / Dragon Hoard.

**location_details:** A repurposed golden-age villa with a sunny courtyard, cool stone stacks, and a roof used for star-gazing. Smells of vanilla, old paper, and mint. It is Cornelius's home and the "base of operations" for the investigation's intellectual side.

#### additional_location_2

**location_name:** Cassius's Bakery (The Hearth)

**location_details:** located three flights down from the library. Smells of woodsmoke and honey. It acts as the town's communal oven and the source of the "Mother Dough" used in the camp.

#### additional_location_3

**location_name:** The Oar & Anchor (The Tavern)

**location_details:** Harbor-front sailor bar. Loud, smells of anise and brine. Neutral ground for the fisher-folk and Orc merchants. Run by Despina Kraikos.

**location_details:** Mid-town thermal baths covered in intricate mosaics. Where business deals happen in the nude.

**location_details:** Whitewashed, blindingly bright clinic. Smells of lavender and antiseptic spirits. The center for healing magic.

#### additional_location_6

**location_details:** Chaotic mix of crates, fish guts, and foreign languages. The economic engine of the town.

#### additional_location_7
