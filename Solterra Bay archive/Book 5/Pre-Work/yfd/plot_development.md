### plot_beats
[For each beat, be specific and ensure the number of explicit/steamy scenes matches project requirements. For each intimate scene, provide a brief description and story location. Place a detailed, choreographed version of each scene in the appropriate chapter of the Outline.]

**beat_1_hook:** **The Camp Begins (Ch 1):** The "Status Quo" is established. Cornelius is annoyed by the primitive conditions of the camp but determined to run it with military precision. We see the "Order" before the "Chaos."

**beat_2_inciting_incident:** **The Transformation (Ch 2):** The first "Body Drop." Lukas turns into a pigeon overnight. The premise of the camp (fun) is shattered by the threat (rogue magic). Cornelius decides to **Cover It Up** rather than cancel, locking them into the plot.

**beat_3_investigation_start:** **The Forensics (Ch 3):** Cornelius investigates the crime scene (cookie crumbs). He uses his draconic senses to rule out poison. The "Game" begins: Find the source before the parents find out.

**beat_4_first_pinch_point:** **The Lockdown (Ch 5):** A second victim falls (Tortoise). Cornelius realizes it's spreading. He implements "The Souffle Protocol" to seal the camp. Zeno is framed as the "Special Night Watch" to keep him isolated (Cornelius suspects him).

**beat_5_midpoint_shift:** **The Theory Collapses (Ch 10):** Cornelius is 99% sure it's Zeno (the Prankster). He is about to arrest him when Zeno turns into a Donkey in front of him. Innocence proved by victimization. The investigation is back to square one.

**beat_6_escalation:** **The Ticking Clock (Ch 11-13):** The Town Calligrapher forces a commitment to the date (48 hours). Then, the Parents arrive early (Crisis). The "Locked Room" is breached from the outside.

**beat_7_crisis_point:** **The Twist (Ch 15):** The "All Is Lost" moment isn't a death, but a realization of failure. Cornelius realizes he missed the obvious clue: The Book of Fables. It's Pippa. The culprit is a 9-year-old he cannot "arrest."

**beat_8_chimax:** **The Reversal (Ch 18-19):** Instead of a battle, it's a Bake-Off. Cornelius and Pippa's Mom work *with* Pippa to channel her magic into a cure (The Reversal Cake).

**beat_9_resolution:** **The Bake-Off (Ch 20):** The event goes off. The kids turn back. The parents are none the wiser.

**beat_10_denouement:** **New Status Quo:** Cornelius accepts the chaos. Zeph is promoted. The library gets its funding.

### subgenre_specific_scenes

**signature_scene_1:** **The Magic Baking:** A montage of the kids making "Giggle-Glaze Donuts" or "Floaty-Loaves." It establishes the *whimsy* of the magic system and how it usually works, contrasting with the rogue transformations later.

**signature_scene_2:** **The Draconic Analysis:** Cornelius analyzing a crime scene (a half-eaten cookie) with the intensity of Sherlock Holmes, using his specialized senses (smelling the 'intention' in the sugar).

**signature_scene_3:** **The Transformation:** The horror/comedy moment when a camper turns into an animal. It needs to be "Poofed" not "Body Horror"—clothes left behind, confused animal noise.

**tropes_3:** **Found Family:** The grumpy mentor (Cornelius) adopting the chaotic children.
