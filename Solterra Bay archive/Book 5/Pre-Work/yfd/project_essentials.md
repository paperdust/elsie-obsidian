**genre_and_subgenres:** Cozy Fantasy Mystery, Humorous Fantasy, Low Stakes Fantasy.

**projected_length:** 45,000 - 55,000 words (20 Chapters).

**position_in_series:** Book 5; Standalone mystery within the Solterra Bay series.

**target_audience:** Cozy Fantasy fans, readers of "Legends & Lattes" or "The House in the Cerulean Sea." All ages appropriate.

**tone:** "Summer Camp Gone Wrong." High comedy, frantic energy, sun-drenched panic. Whimsical but internally stressful for the protagonist.

**humor:** High. Situational comedy, slapstick (magical accidents), and character-based humor (Grumpy Perfectionist vs. Chaos).

**heat_spice_level:** 1/5 (None). Focus is on baking and mentorship.

**magic_and_violence_level:** Low violence (Zero lethality). High magic usage, but focused on "Domestic/Craft" magic (Baking) rather than combat. The peril is social/financial, not mortal.

### global_narrative_settings

**pov:** Third Person Limited (Strictly Cornelius Drake).

**tense:** Past Tense.

**narration_split:** Single POV (Cornelius) throughout.

### core_concept

**story_hook:** When the "Magic Baking" summer camp starts turning students into farm animals, a grumpy dragon librarian must solve the mystery before the parents arrive for the final Bake-Off.

**central_conflict:** **Cornelius (Order)** vs. **The Rogue Magic (Chaos)**. The struggle to maintain control and reputation against a reality-warping magical accident that targets the innocent children under his care.

**high_concept_pitch:** It's "The Great British Bake-Off" meets "The Island of Dr. Moreau," supervised by a neurotic dragon who just wants everything to be quiet.

**expanded_premise:** The Solterra Bay Library and Cassius’s Bakery host a joint "Magic Baking" summer camp to raise literary funds. The curriculum involves harmless fun like "Giggle-Glaze Donuts" and "Floaty-Loaves." However, campers start transforming into animals (pigeons, donkeys, turtles) corresponding to the fables they are reading. Cornelius, the camp's reluctant administrator, must use forensic magic to identify the source—which turns out to be Pippa, a 9-year-old latent Bard whose stories are overwriting reality. The climax involves "editing" her story with a counter-spell baked into a cake.

### unique_selling_points

**usp_1:** **Magic Baking:** A hard magic system applied to culinary arts, where ingredients like "Whisper-Wheat" and "Giggle-Glaze" have specific, repeatable effects.

**usp_2:** **The Detective is the Problem:** Cornelius attempts to solve the mystery with "Logic" and "Forensics," but the magic is driven by "Story" and "Emotion," forcing him to adapt his worldview.

### themes

**primary_theme:** **Mentorship vs. Control:** How to nurture potential without stifling it. Cornelius learns that "protecting" the camp doesn't mean "controlling" it.

**secondary_theme_1:** **The Power of Narrative:** Stories shape reality. The danger comes from an uncontrolled story; the salvation comes from a rewritten one.

**secondary_theme_2:** **Community over Perfection:** The ending isn't a perfect, flawless event, but a messy, happy survival.
