**cozy_atmosphere:** The setting is designed to be a "warm hug" despite the chaos. Sunlight, the smell of baking bread, the sound of the sea. Even the "danger" (transformations) is whimsical (a pigeon, not a corpse). The Camp is rustic but safe—wooden cabins, shared meals, fireflies.

**low_stakes_nature:** The peril is strictly **Financial** (Library funding) and **Social** (Reputation). No one is going to die. The worst-case scenario is "The Camp Closes and Cornelius is Embarrassed." This keeps the tone light.

**mystery_style:** **Fair Play Whodunit.** The clues are physical (crumbs, dye) and biological (species traits). The reader should be able to solve it alongside Cornelius. The "Villain" is not evil, just a confused child.

**community_dynamics:** **Found Family.** The core emotional arc is Cornelius (the Grumpy Loner) accepting that he is part of a "Pack" (Imelda, Zeph, Cassius). The town helps solve the problem (Thessaly singing, Imelda managing parents).

**whimsy_and_magic:** Magic is a tool for **Joy/Comfort** (Giggle-Glaze, Mending) or **Narrative Logic** (Fables coming true). It is never used for violence. The magic system rewards creativity (Baking) over power.

**comfort_tropes:**
*   **Food Porn:** Detailed descriptions of baking (crusts cracking, chocolate melting).
*   **The Grumpy/Sunshine Duo:** Cornelius + Zeph/Cassius.
*   **Competence Porn:** Watching Cornelius analyze a clue or Imelda manage a crowd.
*   **Biblio-Fantasy:** The solution comes from understanding *stories/books*.

**resolution_style:** **Restorative.** The ending restores the status quo but leaves the characters closer. The "Villain" is redeemed/helped, not punished. The climax is a community celebration (The Bake-Off), not a battle.
