Chapter 13

The carriage wheels had not yet ceased their rotation upon the gravel when Cornelius Drake identified the crest upon the door. A phoenix rendered in glazed ceramic tile—Doukas family colors, copper and azure. The artistic guild’s mark. Cornelius felt his scales prickle upright along his spine, each one snapping into rigid attention like the pages of a book slammed shut.

They were forty-eight hours early.

The carriage door swung outward. A man descended first, tall and thin, his beard braided with small clay beads that clicked together like Imelda’s copper hair ornaments. He wore a tunic of undyed linen splattered with dried clay and paint. A woman followed, carrying a portfolio case the size of a shield, her silver-streaked hair bound in a kerchief that matched the phoenix tiles.

“Mr. Doukas,” Cornelius said, stepping forward. His voice emerged steady, formal, devoid of the panic currently liquefying his internal organs. “Mrs. Doukas. Welcome to Camp Olea. You are... precipitous.”

“Ah!” Mr. Doukas extended a hand covered in kiln dust. “The dragon fellow. Thais wrote about you. Splendid. We finished the installation in Solterra early. Thought we’d surprise our girl. Is she in the amphitheater? We’ve brought her new sketching charcoals.”

Cornelius’s tail twitched three times against the gravel. “The campers are currently engaged in... immersive fieldwork. Method acting. Embodying the natural world. They are not immediately visible.”

Mrs. Doukas tilted her head. Her eyes, sharp and dark, scanned the olive grove. “How avant-garde. Nature’s Masquerade? We did a series on that in the spring. Very visceral. Very... transformative.”

“Precisely,” Cornelius said. He stepped sideways, attempting to block their view of the Sanctuary Barn. “If you will accompany me to the Refreshment Tent, Imelda will serve spoon sweets. The campers will conclude their exercises shortly.”

A flutter of wings drew his attention. Lukas—the pigeon Lukas—descended from the pergola roof. He wore a scrap of blue cloth tied around his neck like a bandana. The bird landed upon the gravel path exactly between Cornelius and the carriage, pecking at a crumb of Floaty-Loaf that Zeph must have dropped earlier.

Mr. Doukas squinted. “Is that pigeon wearing a neckerchief?”

“Avian behavioral study,” Cornelius said quickly. He advanced on Lukas, making shooing motions with his claws. “Part of the immersive curriculum. The children are studying... ornithological mimicry. Costume design. Move along, bird.”

Lukas cooed. He hopped toward Mrs. Doukas’s shoe.

Cornelius lunged. He caught the pigeon in his claws—gently, but with the firmness of a librarian retrieving a rare manuscript from a unruly patron. Lukas squirmed. The bandana slipped. Cornelius tucked the bird against his chest, shielding the telltale scrap of fabric from view. “Specimen for the biological survey,” he announced. “We shall return him to the... research aviary.”

Mrs. Doukas smiled. “How committed the children must be. Method acting as birds. Thais always did love wings. Though she preferred swans. Very architectural, swans.”

“Indeed,” Cornelius said. He could feel Lukas’s heart beating against his scales, rapid and terrified. “If you will follow me. The Refreshment Tent offers shade. And tea. Very strong tea.”

He turned, hoping to guide them away from the barn, away from the library tent where Maya the turtle resided in her ventilated box, away from Zeph’s room where Zeno the donkey was currently eating hay from a feedbag. He had taken three steps when the bray erupted from the Sanctuary Barn.

It was not a subtle sound. It was a full-throated, nasal, operatic hee-haw that rolled across the olive grove like a sonic boom.

Mr. Doukas paused. “Goodness. Is that a donkey?”

“Local fauna,” Cornelius said. His tail lashed against his own ankles. “The region supports a... robust population of wild equines. Very traditional. Very Cyprian.”

“It sounded close,” Mrs. Doukas said. She turned toward the barn. “Is it in the camp?”

“The Sanctuary Barn serves as a rehabilitation center for distressed wildlife,” Cornelius improvised. He stepped into her path, wings half-furled to block the view. “We teach the children compassionate stewardship. That particular donkey is... Method acting. As a donkey. For authenticity.”

Mr. Doukas stroked his beard. His clay beads clicked. “Deep immersion. Risky, pedagogically. One might lose oneself in the role.”

“That is why we maintain rigorous supervision,” Cornelius said. He gestured urgently toward the pergola. “Shall we? The spoon sweets await. Imelda prepares them with rose water. Very traditional. Very safe.”

He herded them forward, positioning his body between the parents and any line of sight to the barn. Imelda appeared at the pergola entrance, her silver braids gleaming, her expression serenely untroubled by the catastrophe unfolding.

“Mr. and Mrs. Doukas,” Imelda said. She held a tray laden with small crystal glasses and sticky preserves. “Welcome. Thais is currently engaged in a study of negative space. She will join us for luncheon.”

“Negative space,” Mrs. Doukas murmured, accepting a glass. “Excellent. She has been working on her composition.”

Cornelius deposited Lukas behind a clay planter, whispering, “Stay. Do not move. Do not coo.” The pigeon blinked at him with human eyes, then settled into the dust. Cornelius returned to the Doukas parents, positioning himself at the table’s edge where he could watch both the barn and the olive tree where Pippa sometimes read.

“Thais has shown remarkable growth,” Cornelius said. He poured tea with precise, controlled movements. “Her structural analysis of the bread ovens was... geometrically sound.”

Another bray echoed from the barn. Longer this time. Desperate.

“Zeno,” Cornelius said, louder than necessary. “That is the donkey’s name. Zeno. He is... vocal. Expressing his equine truth.”

“Ah,” Mr. Doukas said. He sipped his tea. “Animal spirits. We should sketch him. The line of the neck, the sorrow in the eyes. Very moving.”

“He is not available for sketching,” Cornelius said. “He is... in character. Deeply. One must not disturb the process.”

Mrs. Doukas set down her glass. “We should settle into the Guest Lodge. We brought our own linens, of course. Hotel linens are so impersonal. We’d like to see Thais’s cabin after lunch.”

“Of course,” Imelda said.

Cornelius felt his scales flatten against his body. The Guest Lodge was the Stone Villa—the same building where Zeno was currently housed in Zeph’s room on the upper floor. The same building where Cornelius had conducted his interrogations. The same building where Maya’s empty turtle shell would be discovered if they opened the wrong door.

“The Villa is currently undergoing... humidity treatments,” Cornelius said. “For the books. Very damp weather. Unseasonable. The climate control requires... twenty-four hours to stabilize.”

“We don’t mind damp,” Mr. Doukas said. “We are ceramicists. Clay is damp.”

“Nevertheless,” Cornelius said. He stood, blocking their path to the Villa. “The Refreshment Tent offers superior ventilation. And view. Very scenic. Very... immersive.”

He guided them—herded them—toward the tent’s far side, away from the Villa, away from the barn. He spoke continuously, filling the air with words about curriculum theory, about the importance of embodied learning, about the psychological benefits of temporary zoological transmutation. He used phrases like “liminal identity states” and “therapeutic masquerade.” The Doukas parents nodded, their eyes glazing slightly, their hands moving automatically to their portfolio cases as if seeking the comfort of familiar tools.

From the barn, Zeno brayed again. Then, horribly, he spoke.

“Help,” came the voice, faint and distorted, but unmistakably human. “I’m stuck. I’m—” The words dissolved into another hee-haw.

Mr. Doukas frowned. “Did that donkey just speak?”

“Echo,” Cornelius said. His claws dug into the wooden table. “The valley. The acoustics. Very strange. Very... Cyprian. The wind carries voices from the road. That was likely a shepherd. Calling to his... flock.”

“Sounded like a boy,” Mrs. Doukas said.

“A ewe,” Cornelius said. “A young ewe. In distress. The donkey is... responding. Empathetically. As donkeys do.”

Imelda stepped forward. “Mr. Doukas, I believe Thais mentioned she wished to show you her tile studies. She has been firing pieces in the camp kiln. Very ambitious work. She will be at the Pergola shortly.”

The distraction worked. Mrs. Doukas’s face brightened. “Her glazing? She wrote that she was attempting a copper reduction.”

“Precisely,” Imelda said. “Shall we walk to the Pergola? The light is better there for viewing ceramics.”

Cornelius remained at the table, trembling. He watched them go—Imelda leading the parents toward the kitchen area, away from the Villa, away from the barn. He waited until they were out of sight, then sprinted to the Sanctuary Barn.

Zeph stood at the barn door, holding a bucket of hay, his face pale.

“Boss,” Zeph whispered. “He’s losing it. He keeps trying to talk, but it comes out wrong. And he knocked over the water trough. He’s getting stronger. More... donkey.”

Cornelius pushed past him. Inside, in the straw, Zeno stood in the center of the stall. He was small for a donkey, but his eyes—those were Zeno’s eyes, wide and terrified. The blue mane stood up in ridiculous, bright spikes.

“Zeno,” Cornelius said softly. “Can you understand me?”

Zeno nodded. He opened his mouth. “Hee-haw,” he said. Then, forcing the words: “Sorry. Was... trying... to call... for... help.”

“You must be silent,” Cornelius said. “The parents are here. Forty-eight hours early. If they discover you, the camp closes. The Showcase is void. We lose everything.”

Zeno’s ears drooped. He lowered his head.

“Keep him quiet,” Cornelius told Zeph. “No more braying. No more talking. If he must communicate, have him write. With his hoof. In the dust. But silently.”

“How do I keep a donkey from braying?” Zeph asked.

“Feed him,” Cornelius said. “Constantly. A full donkey is a quiet donkey. Use the Floaty-Loaf crumbs. Keep him docile. And move him. Take him to the upper loft. If the Doukas parents tour the Villa, they must not hear him from Zeph’s room.”

“Where else can I put him?”

Cornelius thought. The library tent? No. Too close to Maya. The pergola? No. Thais was there. The olive grove? Impossible. Pippa was there, reading her book, her vial of dust in her pocket, ready to sprinkle any crumb she found.

“The root cellar,” Cornelius said. “Beneath the Villa. Stone walls. Thick door. Move him there. Now. Before they return from the Pergola.”

Zeph stared. “The root cellar? It’s dark. And full of onions.”

“Onions will mask any... donkey aroma,” Cornelius said. “Go. Use the back stairs. I shall stall the parents.”

He rushed back outside. The Doukas parents were returning from the Pergola with Imelda, Thais walking between them, her face tense with confusion. Cornelius intercepted them at the Villa steps.

“The Guest Lodge is prepared,” he announced, his voice too loud. “We have aired the rooms. The humidity has... dissipated. Miraculously. Very dry now. Very comfortable.”

Mrs. Doukas looked at the Villa door. “We thought we heard an animal. From inside.”

“Central heating,” Cornelius said. “The furnace. It groans. Very old. Very... Cyprian.”

They ascended the stairs. Cornelius positioned himself at the rear, ready to tackle them bodily if they tried to enter Zeph’s room. But Imelda guided them left, toward the guest quarters on the eastern wing, away from the interns’ cells.

“Your room overlooks the grove,” Imelda said, opening a door. “Very peaceful. Very secure.”

Mr. Doukas entered. He set down his portfolio. He walked to the window. “Ah. One can see the barn from here. And the olive tree. Excellent composition. We shall sketch the afternoon light.”

Cornelius froze. From this window, they would see Zeph leading Zeno across the yard. They would see the donkey with the blue mane. They would see Lukas the pigeon flying loops around the pergola.

“Perhaps you would prefer the western view?” Cornelius suggested. “The sunset. Very romantic. Very... immersive.”

“We are here for the artistry,” Mrs. Doukas said, joining her husband at the window. “We wish to see the camp in its natural state. Unvarnished. Raw.”

Cornelius stepped to the window. He looked out. Zeph was emerging from the barn, leading Zeno by a rope halter. The donkey’s blue mane caught the light like a signal flare. Lukas circled overhead. In the olive grove, Pippa sat reading, her book open, her lips moving.

The camp was a minefield. And the Doukas parents had taken up residence in the observation tower.

“The natural state,” Cornelius repeated. His tail drooped. “Yes. Of course. We strive for authenticity here. Very... transformative.”

Mrs. Doukas opened her sketchbook. “We shall begin at once. Don’t mind us, dragon. We are merely observers.”

Cornelius backed toward the door. He needed to move Zeno. He needed to silence the pigeon. He needed to hide the turtle. He needed to manufacture forty-eight hours of normalcy in a camp that had become a menagerie.

He stepped into the hall and closed the door. His legs gave out. He slid down the wall until he sat upon the tiles, his wings drooping, his ledger—his third ledger of the week—digging into his side.

“Observer,” he muttered to the empty hall. “I am the observed. And I am exhausted.”

From the root cellar below, muffled by stone and onions, came a soft, despairing bray.
