Chapter 16

Cornelius Drake moved across the terracotta tiles of the Pergola with the precision of a burglar—if burglars wore spectacles and worried about the humidity levels of their own breath. It was two hours past midnight. The Stone Villa loomed behind him, dark save for the single guttering candle in the eastern wing where the Doukas parents slept the shallow sleep of artists awaiting inspiration. Before him, the kitchen waited, a landscape of shadow and stone.

The olive press slab dominated the center of the space, its ancient circular groove catching the faint starlight that filtered through the vine canopy overhead. Upon it sat the Final Feast cake.

It was massive. A tiered monstrosity of sponge and sugar, frosted in swirls of ivory and gold, already decorated with crystallized violets and spun-sugar swans that caught the dim light like frozen lightning. Cassius had outdone himself. Or rather, he had outdone the capacity of the camp’s sanity to endure. The satyr-kin lay slumped against the clay oven, his head tilted at an angle that would surely crick his neck by morning, his horns dusted with a fresh snowfall of flour. He snored softly, a sound like pages turning in a distant library.

Cornelius did not wake him. He required solitude for this experiment. He required control.

He approached the workbench where the decorative supplies lay in orderly array—pipes of icing, sheets of edible gold leaf, and, in a small crystal jar sealed with a cork, the remainder of the iridescent dust. The violet-green sprinkles. The vector.

His claws clicked against the stone as he retrieved the jar. He held it up to the starlight. The contents shifted, gleaming with an inner luminescence that had nothing to do with mineral composition and everything to do with narrative potential. He uncorked it. The scent that emerged was not of sugar, but of sea salt and ancient paper—the olfactory signature of leaking stories.

Cornelius placed a single sheet of parchment upon the press slab. He positioned his lantern—shielded to a thin slit of light—so that it illuminated the workspace without casting shadows toward the sleeping baker. Method. Order. Observation.

He tipped a pinch of the dust onto the parchment. It formed a small, shimmering mound, no larger than a comma in a legal manuscript.

“Hypothesis,” Cornelius whispered, his voice dry and precise. “The substance is not inherently transformative. It is a blank reagent. A tabula rasa. It assumes the properties of the narrative impressed upon it.”

He had spent the evening cataloging the evidence in his mind. Lukas had become the Prince who wished to fly because Pippa had read of flight while decorating his food. Zeno had become the burdened Knight because she had read of strength and service while dusting his muffin. Maya had become the Lady in the shell because she had read of safety and retreat while sprinkling her brownie. The text was the formula. The sprinkles were merely the ink.

But ink, properly applied, could rewrite reality.

Cornelius leaned close to the mound of dust. His spectacles slid down his snout, and he pushed them back with one claw. He inhaled, tasting the air—olive wood, cooling stone, the faint, yeasty ghost of a thousand loaves. Then he spoke, directing his breath not as flame, but as whisper.

“Once,” he intoned, “there was a grain of salt upon a stone. It was ordinary. It was sodium chloride, harvested from the sea, dried by the sun, bearing no magic but the memory of tides. It was sharp upon the tongue. It was true.”

He touched the tip of his tongue to the dust.

It tasted of salt. Sharp. Crystalline. Bleakly mineral.

Cornelius blinked. He had expected a delay. He had expected resistance. But Narrative Physics operated on the speed of thought, on the immediacy of belief. He had told the sprinkles to be salt, and they had obeyed with the alacrity of a student eager to please.

He spat the grains into his handkerchief—he would not risk ingestion of an unknown alchemical variable—and examined the remainder of the pile. It remained inert. The transformation had been specific, localized to the particles he had tasted. Fascinating. The narrative required proximity. Intent. Consumption.

He tried again.

“Once,” he whispered, selecting a fresh pinch, “there was a grain of sugar. It was sweet. It dissolved upon the tongue like a snowflake in summer, leaving only the memory of sweetness and the chemical formula C₁₂H₂₂O₁₁. It was harmless. It was sucrose.”

He tasted.

Sweetness flooded his mouth, cloying and immediate, followed by the faint, acidic buzz of narrative compliance. The grains had transmuted. They were no longer the violet-green dust of potential; they were simple, mundane sugar.

Cornelius stepped back from the slab. His tail twitched, a metronome of rising dread.

“It is Bardic Magic,” he said to the darkness. “Not culinary alchemy. Not herbalism. True Bardic inscription.”

He understood now. Pippa was not merely reading stories. She was a Bard of the Old Line—a lineage thought extinct in the modern age, where magic was regulated by the Council’s Culinary Oversight Committee and bottled in standardized vials. The Bards of old had not cast spells with wands or incantations. They had used words as vectors, impressing reality with the weight of metaphor. And they had required a medium. Ink, originally. Blood, in darker times. And in the tradition of the Baker’s Guild—sugar.

Sugar was the perfect blank slate. It dissolved. It integrated. It carried flavor, and flavor was just another word for story.

Cornelius turned his attention to the cake.

It was three tiers high, each layer separated by strata of jam and cream, the whole structure supported by internal dowels of cinnamon stick. The frosting had been applied with mathematical precision—Cassius’s hand had been steady after their talk, steady and sure. The spun-sugar swans sat atop the uppermost tier, their wings spread in a posture of imminent departure. There were twelve of them. A Baker’s Dozen, minus one.

Thirteen servings. Thirteen swans. The number hummed with narrative significance.

Cornelius calculated the volume. The cake weighed, he estimated, forty-seven pounds. With the frosting, the decorative elements, the internal structure, and the inevitable accretion of magical resonance that would occur during the Parent Showcase feast, the mass would be sufficient to serve as a levitation device for the entire camp compound.

He looked at the cake. Then he looked at the Stone Villa. Then at the Sanctuary Barn, visible as a dark rectangle beyond the olive trees.

“The kingdom rises,” Cornelius whispered, recalling Pippa’s words. “The castle, the towers, the gardens, all the people—rose into the sky and flew to the moon.”

If she finished the story while this cake was being consumed—if she read the final page as the parents lifted their forks, as the Doukas parents tasted Cassius’s masterpiece—the narrative would complete itself. The cake would become the vehicle. The camp would become the kingdom. And they would all fly away. Not metaphorically. Not poetically. Physically. Two hundred feet of stone and timber, of children and parents and books, lifting into the thermosphere on a pillar of narrative thrust, bound for the airless silence of the lunar surface.

To be safe. To be shelved.

Cornelius’s claws dug into the press slab, seeking purchase against a vertigo that had nothing to do with altitude and everything to do with responsibility. He had been wrong. He had spent a week hunting for a saboteur, for a culprit with malice aforethought. He had accused Zeno of chromatic terrorism. He had suspected Kyria of Council espionage. He had cataloged the sprinkles as poison when they were merely paper—blank, waiting, desperate for a story to tell.

And now the story was written. The cake was baked. The ending approached.

He looked at the sleeping Cassius. The baker had trusted him. “You bake, I shall lie,” Cornelius had promised. But lies would not stop a Bardic narrative. Only a better story could do that. A counter-narrative. An edit in the margins, as he had told Pippa.

But to write such a counter-narrative, he needed to understand the medium. He needed to understand the author.

Pippa was nine years old. She possessed an ancient book with gold-edged pages. She possessed a vial of reagent-grade narrative dust. She possessed, apparently, the innate ability to impress reality with her wishes. Such power did not emerge from nothing. It was inherited. It was trained, or it was bound.

Cornelius removed his spectacles and cleaned them with his handkerchief. His hands trembled, just slightly, a tremor he had not experienced since his first day as a Library Dragon, when he had been tasked with cataloging the Lost Epics of Thrace and had realized the weight of preserving what could not be replaced.

He needed lineage. He needed genealogy. He needed to know whose bloodline had produced a child who could rewrite physics with a fairy tale and a sugar cookie.

He looked once more at the cake. It sat there, innocent and deadly, a Trojan Horse of flour and butter, waiting for the final chapter.

Cornelius turned away. He did not wake Cassius. There was no point alarming the baker until he had a solution. One did not announce a fire in the library until one had located the extinguisher.

He moved back across the Pergola, his claws clicking a softer rhythm now, a retreat rather than an advance. He needed his books. Not the cookbooks. Not the Council’s Culinary Regulations. He needed the Bardic Histories. The Lineages of the Scop. The genealogical records of the Miller family—if that was even their true name.

Behind him, the cake gleamed in the starlight, a monument to potential energy, waiting for the word that would launch it.

Cornelius disappeared into the dark, his mind already sorting indices, already searching for a story strong enough to hold the ground beneath their feet.
