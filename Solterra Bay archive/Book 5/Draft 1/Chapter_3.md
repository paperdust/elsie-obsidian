Cornelius Drake arranged his instruments upon the stone press with the precision of a surgeon preparing for autopsy. The massive circular stone, once used to crush olives into oil, now served as his forensic laboratory. Its surface, pitted and stained with centuries of agricultural residue, provided an anchor for his investigation—solid, unyielding, and entirely within his control.

He placed the evidence bag containing the rogue crumb at the northern edge of the stone. The bag itself was constructed of waxed canvas, sealed with a double fold to prevent contamination. Beside it, he positioned the control sample: a crumb from the unused portion of the Giggle-Glaze batch, obtained from Cassius's secured stores that morning. The control rested upon a fresh index card, labeled in Cornelius's precise script: *Specimen A: Unadulterated Giggle-Glaze, 08:47.*

Cornelius adjusted his spectacles. The humidity pressed against his scales, but he ignored it. The stone beneath his claws was cool, rough, grounding. He had work requiring absolute concentration.

He began with the control. Cornelius lowered his snout until his nostrils hovered a precise half-inch above Specimen A. He inhaled slowly, filtering the scent components through his specialized olfactory membranes.

Vanilla. Cane sugar. The faint, peppery undertone of giggleroot—alchemically stabilized, properly diluted, entirely within permit parameters. Beneath these primary notes, he detected the binding agents: egg white, butterfat, wheat gluten. The magical signature vibrated at a steady yellow frequency, visible to his draconic perception as a faint aura surrounding the crumb. It pulsed slowly, metronomically, like a heartbeat regulated by clockwork.

Cornelius recorded these observations in his notebook: *Control sample exhibits stable thaumaturgic resonance. No anomalies detected. Compliant with Council Edict 447-B.*

He turned to the evidence bag.

Cornelius unsealed the waxed canvas with careful claws. The rogue crumb tumbled onto the stone surface, catching the ambient light. Immediately, he noticed the visual discrepancy. Where the control sample had displayed a uniform golden-brown coloration with standard glaze crystallization, this fragment shimmered with an iridescent quality that shifted between violet and green depending on the angle of observation.

He inhaled.

Sea salt. Sharp, mineral, ancient. And beneath it, the unmistakable scent of old paper—not the mildewed rot of neglected volumes, but the dry, crisp aroma of vellum stored in climate-controlled caves, of scrolls untouched for centuries. The smell of narrative itself, of stories pressed into physical form.

Cornelius's scales prickled. This was not giggleroot. This was not any substance cataloged in the Council's approved culinary alchemy indices.

He extended his claw, hesitated, then touched the crumb.

The reaction was immediate. Where the control sample had emitted a steady yellow pulse, this fragment sang. A complex melody hummed against his scales, discordant and shifting, a tune without fixed meter or key. It reminded Cornelius of children's nursery rhymes sung backward, of fairy tales recited by voices that did not understand the words.

The iridescence intensified, pulsing in time with the melody. Chaos magic. Narrative physics. Reality bending to accommodate a story that had been told over these crumbs.

Cornelius stepped back, his breath coming short. His mind raced through classification systems. Transformation triggers. Mimic spells. The theoretical intersection of culinary alchemy and bibliomancy. None of his reference texts contained protocols for this specific contamination.

"Boss?"

Cornelius spun, his wings half-extending in alarm. Zeno stood at the edge of the Pergola, his blue hair disheveled, his grin displaying too many teeth. The satyr-kin held a burlap sack that emitted a faint, yeasty aroma.

"I didn't do it," Zeno said immediately.

Cornelius's scales flattened against his body. "You have not been accused."

"Yeah, but you're doing that thing where you look at me like I exploded something." Zeno set the sack down. It landed with a heavy thump. "This is just flour. For the muffins. I was... checking it. For weevils."

Cornelius approached the sack with measured steps. "You were checking for insect infestation at six in the morning?"

"I get up early. Satyr biology." Zeno's hooves scraped against the stone. "Okay, fine. I might have added something to the flour. But it's not what you're looking for! It's just yeast. Extra yeast. I thought if I boosted the rising agent, the Giggle-Glaze Muffins would float higher. Like, way higher. Into the trees. It was gonna be hilarious."

Cornelius stared at the satyr-kin. "You tampered with the baking supplies."

"Technically, yes. But look—" Zeno opened the sack. The flour inside appeared standard, white, powdery. "It's just yeast. It makes things rise. It doesn't turn people into birds. I heard what happened to Lukas. That's messed up. But I didn't do that part."

Cornelius extended his claw into the flour. He withdrew a pinch, brought it to his nose. Yeast. Active, cultured, mundane. He touched it to his tongue. The familiar tang of fermentation, nothing more. No iridescence. No melody of chaos.

He performed a quick spectral analysis, holding the flour to the light. It glowed with a faint, steady yellow—the same stable resonance as the control Giggle-Glaze sample, but weaker, non-magical, merely the background thrum of organic matter.

"The flour contains only yeast," Cornelius confirmed. "It would have enhanced levitation duration, potentially causing the muffins to rise indefinitely, but it would not trigger transmutation."

Zeno's shoulders dropped. "So I'm not in trouble for the bird thing?"

"You are in trouble for the yeast," Cornelius said. "However, you are cleared of the transformation mechanism. The contamination source remains unidentified."

"Cool," Zeno said. "I mean, not cool about Lukas. But cool that you know I didn't do the worst part." He paused. "Are you going to tell Cassius about the yeast?"

"Yes," Cornelius said. "After we resolve the immediate crisis. Depart. I require solitude for analysis."

Zeno grabbed his sack and clattered away, his hooves striking a rhythm that Cornelius found marginally less irritating than previous performances. The satyr-kin was a chaos agent, certainly, but he was a predictable chaos—yeast and pranks, not narrative transmutation.

Cornelius returned to the stone press. The evidence crumb still shimmered, still hummed its discordant melody. He had eliminated the obvious suspect. The paranoia began to creep in, cold against his scales.

If not Zeno, then who? Who possessed access to the donuts, knowledge of narrative magic, and the capacity to hide in plain sight?

The image of Pippa came to him unbidden. Small, quiet, perpetually reading. The iridescent sprinkles. The cookies. The whispered stories under the olive tree.

He pushed the thought aside. Speculation without evidence was unprofessional. He required proof. He required containment.

Cornelius gathered the evidence crumb, sealed it in a fresh waxed bag, and placed it in his vest pocket. He then turned his attention to the pigeon.

Lukas—he must think of the bird as Lukas—had perched on the edge of the stone press, watching him with an expression of avian irritation that matched the boy's usual demeanor. The transformation appeared stable. The pigeon was healthy, alert, and maintaining the behavioral patterns of the original subject—specifically, the tendency to demand food.

"You are safe," Cornelius told the bird. "I shall restore you. This is a promise."

The pigeon cooed, a sound that conveyed skepticism.

Cornelius considered his options. He could not keep Lukas in the Treehouse Cabin. The other boys would panic. He could not keep him in the Villa—the risk of discovery by Kyria or early-rising parents was too high. He required a secure location, climate-controlled, isolated from the general population but accessible for study.

The dovecote.

The Sanctuary Barn possessed an old dovecote in its upper loft, unused for decades but structurally sound. It had ventilation, protection from predators, and sufficient space for one transformed boy-pigeon. Most importantly, it was within Cornelius's patrol perimeter but outside the campers' regular traffic patterns.

"Come," Cornelius said, extending his arm.

The pigeon hopped onto his forearm, gripping with claws that dug slightly into the scales. Cornelius winced but did not shake the bird off. He tucked Lukas against his chest, where the warmth of his body would comfort the transformed child, and moved with swift precision toward the Sanctuary Barn.

The Barn stood at the camp's eastern edge, its stone walls thick with the moss Kyria had incorrectly identified as a health violation. Cornelius entered through the side door, his claws clicking against the flagstones. The interior smelled of hay and old wood, safe and dry.

He climbed the ladder to the loft, the pigeon clinging to his vest. The dovecote occupied the highest point, a wooden structure with small arched entrances and a wire mesh front. Cornelius opened the latch with his claw, placed Lukas inside on a bed of fresh straw he had Zeph procure earlier, and secured the mesh.

"You will be safe here," Cornelius said. "No hawks. No curious children. I shall return with food and research materials."

The pigeon pecked at the straw, then looked up at him with those disturbingly familiar eyes. It cooed, a soft sound that might have been gratitude or might have been a demand for crackers.

Cornelius descended the ladder and exited the Barn. He needed to speak with Imelda. He needed to establish containment protocols. He needed to understand how a narrative spell had infiltrated his camp.

He found her in the Villa's common room, seated at the table with a cup of tea that steamed with something herbal and sharp. Her silver braids caught the light as she looked up, her expression calm but her eyes—ancient, knowing—fixed upon him with unusual intensity.

"You have moved him," she said. It was not a question.

"To the dovecote," Cornelius confirmed. "It is secure. Climate appropriate. Isolated."

"His parents arrive in three days," Imelda said. "For the mid-session family day. The Council inspection follows immediately after."

Cornelius's scales tightened against his body. Three days. Seventy-two hours. He had seventy-two hours to reverse a transformation wrought by magic he did not understand, using methods he had not yet discovered, while maintaining the illusion of a functioning, safe, Council-compliant educational program.

"We have a mimic," Cornelius said. His voice was steady. "Something has entered this camp wearing the skin of our curriculum. It walks among us, wearing a child's face, reading fairy tales, sprinkling chaos into dough."

Imelda raised one eyebrow. "You speak of Pippa."

"I speak of the evidence," Cornelius said. "I speak of sea salt and ancient paper. I speak of a spell that turns boys into birds because someone whispered a story over their food." He paused, his claws clicking against the terracotta tiles. "But yes. I suspect Pippa. And I suspect Zeno. And I suspect that I have failed to understand the nature of the enemy."

Imelda set down her tea. "Then you must learn. Quickly. Before the parents arrive, and we are forced to explain why their son is roosting with the pigeons."

Cornelius nodded, his golden eyes narrowing behind his spectacles. He would analyze. He would categorize. He would hunt the mimic that had stolen Lukas's shape.

And this time, he would not look away from the quiet children reading under trees.
