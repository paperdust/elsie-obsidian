Chapter 12

Cornelius Drake arranged his third ledger of the week upon the Stone Villa’s porch table with the precision of a jeweler setting a flawed diamond. The terracotta tiles beneath his claws retained the afternoon’s warmth, but Cornelius ignored the heat. He focused on the alignment: the ledger’s spine exactly parallel to the table’s edge, the quill placed at a ninety-degree angle to the inkwell, the evidence bags arranged in ascending order by weight.

The evidence bags contained sprinkles.

Specifically, they contained the iridescent dust recovered from Zeno’s donkey muzzle, from Maya’s empty dessert plate, and from the base of the olive tree where the glass vial had been found. The dust shifted between violet and green even within the waxed paper confines, defying categorization.

Cornelius dipped his claw into the inkwell. He wrote: *Evidence Analysis, Day Six, Hour Fourteen. Primary Vector: Decorative Particulate. Secondary Vector: Unknown.*

“You’re doing that thing again,” Zeph said.

Cornelius did not look up. He adjusted his spectacles. “I am cataloging. It is a necessary function. Without cataloging, we have chaos. Without order, we have—”

“You have that twitch,” Zeph interrupted. He stood at the porch railing, his lanky frame casting a long shadow across the tiles. His hair—dark with that metallic bronze sheen—stood in wild peaks. He had not slept. Cornelius could see the evidence of insomnia in the boy’s posture, in the way his fingers drummed against the stone balustrade. “The one where your tail hits the floor three times fast. You’re gearing up to blame someone.”

“I am gearing up to solve a mystery,” Cornelius corrected. He capped the inkwell. “Specifically, the mystery of the narrative contamination that has transformed three campers into fauna and threatens to convert a fourth should we not intervene within forty-eight hours.”

Zeph turned. His eyes were bloodshot. “You’re going to talk to Pippa.”

It was not a question.

“I intend to interview all witnesses,” Cornelius said. He straightened his waistcoat. The bronze scales along his spine prickled, lifting slightly from his skin. “Pippa is a witness. She has been present at multiple contamination sites. She arranged the Mood-Muffins. She dusted the Floaty-Loaf. She served the Sleepy-Time Squares. The probability of coincidence approaches zero.”

“She’s nine,” Zeph said. His voice cracked. “She’s a kid. She’s Lukas’s sister. She wouldn’t—”

“She would not intend harm,” Cornelius agreed. “Intent and capability are distinct variables. One may cause catastrophe through ignorance as readily as through malice.”

Zeph stepped forward. His hands were clenched into fists. “You’re wrong. I know you’re wrong. She’s just… she’s sweet. She likes glitter. That doesn’t make her a witch.”

“I did not suggest witchcraft,” Cornelius said. “I suggested narrative contamination via decorative vector. There is a difference. One requires malice. The other requires only proximity and misunderstanding.”

The porch door opened. Imelda emerged, her silver braids clicking with copper beads. She held Pippa’s hand. The child walked beside her, small and neat, her pigtails tied with ribbons that matched the violet-green of the sprinkles. She clutched a book to her chest. The book was old, its cover soft with wear, its pages edged with gold.

“Pippa has agreed to speak with us,” Imelda said. Her voice was calm, a stone in still water. “She understands we are trying to help Zeno.”

Pippa nodded. Her eyes were large, brown, and unblinking. She looked at Cornelius, then at Zeph, then back to the ledger upon the table. She did not look frightened. She looked curious.

Cornelius felt a strange sensation in his chest. He ignored it. He indicated the chair across from him with one claw. “Please sit. I shall require your assistance with a matter of camp inventory.”

Pippa sat. She placed the book upon her lap. Her feet dangled above the terracotta, swinging slightly.

“Do you recognize these?” Cornelius asked. He pushed one evidence bag across the table. The violet-green dust swirled within.

Pippa leaned forward. She did not touch the bag. She studied it with the intensity she usually reserved for fairy tales. “It’s pretty,” she said.

“It is iridescent,” Cornelius agreed. “It has been found upon multiple food items consumed by campers who subsequently experienced… transformations. You applied this substance to several baked goods. The Mood-Muffins. The Sleepy-Time Squares. A piece of Floaty-Loaf given to Bennie.”

Pippa nodded. “I was helping. Everything should be pretty. And lucky.”

Zeph made a small sound. Cornelius held up one claw for silence.

“Lucky,” Cornelius repeated. “You were attempting to bestow luck?”

“Mama says we need luck,” Pippa said. She hugged her book tighter. “She says the world is hard and we need all the luck we can get. But she won’t let me have the real kind. The old kind. So I make my own.”

She reached into her pocket. She withdrew a small glass vial. It was identical to the empty one found beneath the olive tree. It contained more of the violet-green dust, swirling like captured starlight.

“I mix it myself,” Pippa said, proud. “Sugar and sparkles and stories. I read the words from my book, and I sprinkle it on. For sweet dreams. For floating. For… for being safe.”

Cornelius stared at the vial. His scales went flat against his body. He felt the cold sensation of data realigning.

“You read words,” he said slowly. “From your book. Over the sugar.”

Pippa opened the book. The pages were illustrated with woodcut prints: swans rising from ovens, children turning into birds, dough that walked like men. The text was handwritten, old, the ink faded to brown.

“I read the stories that feel right,” Pippa said. “The ones that match the food. Like matching socks. The Donkey Prince likes muffins. The Sleeping Maiden likes brownies. The—”

“Bibliomancy,” Cornelius whispered. “Unstructured, intuitive bibliomancy.”

He looked at Imelda. Imelda’s expression did not change, but her fingers tightened slightly on her beads.

“Pippa,” Cornelius said, turning back to the child. “Do you understand that the sprinkles… change things? That they make the stories real?”

Pippa frowned. She looked at the vial in her hand. “I just wanted everything to be nice. Zeno was sad in the barn. Maya was scared of the dark. I thought… I thought if I made it pretty, and lucky, the stories would keep them safe. Like a blanket.”

She looked up, and for the first time, her lower lip trembled. “Did I do it wrong? Is that why Zeno is sick? Is that why he won’t come out of Zephyr’s room?”

Cornelius opened his mouth. He closed it.

Zeph stepped forward. He knelt beside Pippa’s chair, putting himself between her and Cornelius. “You didn’t do anything wrong, Pip. You were trying to help. It’s not your fault.”

“But the stories,” Pippa said. Her voice was very small. “They’re supposed to have happy endings. That’s the rule. The baker’s dozen always gets un-spelled. The prince always turns back. That’s how it works.”

Cornelius felt the floor tilt beneath him. Not literally—the porch was solid stone—but the sensation was identical. He had been searching for a saboteur. He had been searching for malice, for complexity, for an adult mind with adult intentions. He had been looking for someone like himself: deliberate, controlled, dangerous through precision.

Instead, he found a child who believed in luck.

“She’s not the culprit,” Cornelius said. The words tasted strange. “She is… she is a catalyst. Unwitting. Unaware. She possesses no magical training. She cannot be the architect of the contamination. She is merely the… the delivery system.”

“What?” Zeph stood up. “So that’s it? She’s off the hook?”

“She is not on any hook,” Cornelius said. He closed the ledger with a snap. “She lacks the requisite skill to have engineered this crisis. She lacks intent. She is sprinkling sugar and reading nursery rhymes. This is not sabotage. This is…” He stopped. He looked at the vial in Pippa’s hand. “This is something else entirely.”

Imelda stepped forward. She placed a hand upon Pippa’s shoulder. “The magic is responding to her belief,” Imelda said quietly. “To her need for the world to be safe and storied. It is not an attack. It is a protection spell gone feral.”

“Precisely,” Cornelius said. He began to pace, his tail lashing. “Which means the true vector is external. Someone introduced this… this narrative dust to the camp. Someone gave her the vial, or taught her the method, or planted the book. Pippa is a tool, not the hand that wields it.”

He stopped. He turned to Zeph. “We must look elsewhere. Rival bakeries. The Council. The Orcs from the eastern district who opposed our grant. Little Kyria—she has been documenting violations. Perhaps she has been manufacturing them as well.”

“You’re just shifting blame,” Zeph said. His voice was hard. “You can’t accept that maybe it’s just… chaos. Maybe it’s just kids and magic and accidents. You have to have a villain.”

“I require a solution,” Cornelius snapped. “And solutions require causes. If Pippa did not create the dust—if she merely found it or was given it—then the creator is still at large. And that creator is the true threat.”

He gathered his ledger. He gathered his evidence bags. He looked at Pippa, who sat very still, holding her book and her vial.

“You may go,” Cornelius said. “Do not sprinkle anything else. Do not read over any food. Do you understand?”

Pippa nodded. She slid off the chair. She clutched the book to her chest like a shield.

“But the story isn’t over,” Pippa said. “The Baker’s Dozen Swans. They have to turn back. They have to. Or the baker loses everything.”

“Go,” Cornelius said, more gently than he intended.

Imelda guided Pippa toward the door. Zeph hesitated, looking back at Cornelius with an expression that hovered between betrayal and pity. Then he followed them inside.

Cornelius stood alone on the porch. He opened his ledger. He crossed out *Pippa Miller* with a single decisive line. He wrote: *External Sabotage Theory. Suspect: Little Kyria Varka. Motive: Council infiltration. Method: Supply of contaminated decorative materials.*

It made sense. It fit the pattern. It was logical.

He looked at the empty chair where Pippa had sat. He looked at the tiles, where a few grains of violet-green dust had fallen from her pocket. They glittered in the afternoon light.

Cornelius turned away. He had forty-eight hours. He had a suspect to interrogate. He marched off the porch toward the olive grove, where Little Kyria was said to be conducting her inspection.

Behind him, forgotten on the steps, Pippa’s book lay open. The pages fluttered in the breeze. A picture showed twelve swans wearing aprons, and one thirteenth swan rising from a pie crust. The text beneath was written in a looping, ancient hand.

Pippa sat on the steps. She picked up the book. She began to read aloud, her voice soft and steady, telling the story of the baker who loved his swans too much, and the spell that bound them in feathers until the right words could set them free.

She read the words exactly as they were written. The dust in her pocket swirled. The air smelled suddenly of burnt sugar and old paper.

But Cornelius did not hear. He was already gone, hunting for a villain who did not exist, while the real magic sat on the steps, reading the recipe for disaster aloud to the empty air.
