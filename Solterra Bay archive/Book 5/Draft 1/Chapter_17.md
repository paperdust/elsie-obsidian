Chapter 17

Cornelius Drake adjusted his spectacles and surveyed the dining area with the tactical precision of a general planning an assault upon a fortified archive. The buffet had been arranged upon the long oak table in the center of the Stone Villa’s ground floor, a landscape of porcelain and silver that presented both opportunity and hazard. Parents milled about the space, clutching plates of scrambled eggs and grilled halloumi, their voices creating a low rumble of social artillery that Cornelius found intellectually exhausting.

He straightened his waistcoat. The fabric pulled taut across his scales, a sensation he found grounding. He needed grounding. Four hours remained until the Bake-Off. Four hours until Pippa might complete her story and launch the entire camp toward the lunar surface. Four hours to solve the riddle of her lineage before the narrative thrust became irreversible.

He identified his targets immediately. Mr. and Mrs. Miller stood near the coffee service, a pair of pleasantly nondescript humans whose clothing suggested practical, suburban reliability. Mrs. Miller wore a linen dress the color of unbleached parchment; Mr. Miller held a mug in a grip that suggested he handled tools for a living, or perhaps managed inventories. They laughed at something Cassius said, their expressions open and utterly devoid of magical awareness. Perfect. Terrifying.

Cornelius approached with measured steps, his claws clicking against the terracotta tiles in a rhythm he had calculated to sound both authoritative and non-threatening. Imelda stood nearby, positioned with the casual grace of a sentinel, her presence a silent reassurance that Cornelius would not be permitted to socially implode without intervention.

“Mr. and Mrs. Miller,” Cornelius said, executing a small bow that brought his snout level with their elbows. “I am Cornelius Drake, the Library Coordinator. Might I inquire as to your satisfaction with the camp’s hospitality?”

Mrs. Miller turned, her smile bright and unguarded. “Oh, Mr. Drake! Pippa has written such enthusiastic letters. She adores the library tent, apparently. Always with her nose in a book.”

“Yes,” Cornelius said, his tail giving a single, sharp twitch. “The child exhibits remarkable bibliophilic tendencies. Remarkable. Might I inquire as to your family’s history with literacy? Or perhaps with... oral traditions?”

Mr. Miller blinked. “Oral traditions? Like storytelling?”

“Precisely.” Cornelius reached for a plate, selecting a slice of cold melon with deliberate precision. He did not intend to eat it; he intended to have a prop that would allow him to stand near them without appearing to interrogate. “One finds that narrative inclinations often run in bloodlines. Genetic predispositions toward metaphor, as it were.”

The Millers exchanged a glance that suggested they were humoring a eccentric camp counselor. Cornelius had encountered such glances before. He pressed onward.

“Perhaps a grandparent with theatrical leanings?” he suggested. “Or a tendency toward... exaggeration?”

Mrs. Miller laughed, a sound like pages rustling. “Well, my mother was quite the character. She lived out in the Nymph-Groves, near the old wheat silos. Very... artistic. She used to claim she could sing the wheat into flour, if you can believe that. Just by humming over the grain.”

Cornelius went very still. His spectacles slid down his snout, but he did not push them up. “Sing... wheat into flour?”

“Oh, it was just superstition,” Mrs. Miller said, waving her hand dismissively. “Old country nonsense. She had a lovely voice, certainly, but we never put any stock in the magical talk. When I moved to the city, I left all that folklore behind. We raised Pippa to be practical. Sensible.”

Sensible. Cornelius felt his scales prickle upright along his spine. Superstition. The word struck him like a dropped tome. He looked at Mrs. Miller’s face—open, honest, magically null—and then at Mr. Miller, who nodded in agreement. They had suppressed it. They had taken a Bardic lineage, a Dryad-touched inheritance that sang wheat into flour, and they had labeled it superstition. They had shelved it.

And now the magic had skipped a generation and erupted in Pippa, untrained, unmanaged, and desperate to tell stories that would keep everyone safe.

“Of course,” Cornelius said, his voice strained. “Sensible. Practical. How... prudent.”

He needed air. He needed space to calculate. The revelation struck him with the force of an alchemical reaction: Pippa was not merely a Narrative Mage. She was a magical nuclear reactor, built from suppressed Dryad heritage and Bardic blood, operating without containment protocols. Her grandmother had sung wheat into flour—a straightforward agricultural enchantment—and had likely passed the gift to her granddaughter, diluted but potent.

But without training, without the Camp Olea curriculum that taught children to channel their magic safely, the gift had leaked sideways. It had found the sugar. It had found the book. It had begun rewriting reality according to the only framework Pippa understood: fairy tales with happy endings.

“Excuse me,” Cornelius said, setting down his uneaten melon slice with a click against the porcelain. “I must consult with Head Librarian Kassiani regarding... archival procedures.”

He turned and moved with controlled haste, his claws skidding slightly on the tiles. Imelda detached herself from her position near the sideboard and fell into step beside him, her movements fluid and silent.

“What did you learn?” she asked, her voice low.

Cornelius propelled them both toward the eastern corridor, away from the parental hubbub. “The grandmother,” he said, his words clipped and precise. “Nymph-Groves origin. Dryad-touched, capable of transmuting wheat via vocalization. The parents dismissed it as superstition. They suppressed the lineage. Pippa is a flare-up of suppressed Bardic-Dryad hybrid magic, operating without conscious control.”

Imelda’s eyebrows rose. “A suppressed magical bloodline?”

“Precisely.” Cornelius stopped near the doorway, turning to face her. His tail lashed once against the stone wall. “She is not a saboteur, Imelda. She is a child whose heritage has been denied. The magic must express itself. It has been seeking expression through the only channels available: sugar and story. If we attempt to cage her, to silence her, the pressure will only increase. The narrative thrust will become catastrophic.”

He thought of the cake waiting in the Pergola, the forty-seven pounds of flour and butter and narrative potential. He thought of Pippa’s small hands holding his brass pen, her uncertainty about how to write a new ending.

“We cannot arrest her,” Cornelius said. “We cannot contain her. The Camp Olea mission is validated in this moment: magic must be taught, or it becomes dangerous. We have been attempting to suppress a natural force with locks and ledgers, just as her parents suppressed her grandmother’s singing.”

Imelda regarded him with those calm, unshakeable eyes. “Then what do we do?”

Cornelius adjusted his spectacles. His claws trembled slightly, but his voice steadied. “We do not need a cage,” he said. “We need an Editor.”

Imelda nodded slowly. “The story.”

“The story,” Cornelius confirmed. “We have four hours to teach a nine-year-old Bard how to rewrite the ending of her own tale before she accidentally launches us all into orbit. I require your assistance, Imelda. I require your calm. I require your diplomatic immunity from the laws of narrative physics.”

“You have it,” she said.

Cornelius squared his shoulders. The weight of the revelation settled upon him, not as a burden, but as a map. He knew the terrain now. He knew the enemy, and the enemy was not Pippa. The enemy was the ending she had been given, the story that insisted safety lay in flight, in escape, in shelving.

“We must locate Pippa,” Cornelius said. “And we must find that book. Immediately.”

He turned toward the library, his claws clicking a new rhythm against the stone—not the retreat of a defeated strategist, but the advance of a librarian who had finally located the correct index.
