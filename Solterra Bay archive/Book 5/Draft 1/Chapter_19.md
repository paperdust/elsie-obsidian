Chapter 19

Cornelius Drake stood upon the terracotta tiles of the Pergola and watched the red light fade from Pippa’s pockets. The arterial glow dimmed to a soft, pulsing pink—the color of dawn viewed through closed eyelids. Mrs. Miller’s arms remained wrapped around her daughter, her linen dress pooling on the stone like a spill of unbleached parchment. The humming continued, low and resonant, a sound that seemed to vibrate in the mortar between the stones.

The book lay on the floor, its gold-edged pages darkened where Pippa’s tears had fallen. The scent of ozone and burning paper—that sharp, dangerous aroma of narrative run wild—dissipated, replaced by the mundane, grounding smell of spilled coffee and yeast.

“Three hours,” Cornelius said. His voice emerged steadier than he felt. “Correction. We now possess approximately sixty minutes until the Bake-Off judging commences. The parents are assembling. Master Orestes has likely arrived with his truth-sensing sinuses.”

Mrs. Miller looked up from Pippa’s shoulder. Her eyes were fierce, terrified, and perfectly focused. “Tell me how to fix my children.”

Cornelius adjusted his spectacles. His tail twitched once against a sack of flour, sending up a small puff of white dust. “We require a counter-narrative. The Final Feast cake is keyed to a story of flight and escape. We must bake an alternative ending.”

He turned to the three-tier monstrosity dominating the olive press slab. The sugar swans trembled slightly, their wings still angled for departure. The cake hummed with potential energy, a reservoir of forty-seven pounds of flour and butter waiting to enact Pippa’s original story.

“We cannot simply destroy it,” Cornelius continued, gesturing with one claw. “The narrative thrust is too powerful. It must be redirected. Consumed. Rewritten from within.”

Cassius emerged from behind the fermentation vats, his hooves clicking against the tiles. His hands were still dusted with flour, his horns wrapped in gauze. “A Reversal Cake,” he whispered. His voice cracked. “I have heard of such things. In the old texts. A cake that un-eats a transformation. But it requires a foundation of absolute grounding. Earth-magic. Not the airy levitation of the swans.”

Mrs. Miller stood, lifting Pippa with her. The child clung to her mother’s waist, her face pressed against the linen. “My mother,” Mrs. Miller said, her voice gaining strength. “She did not sing wheat into flour to make it fly. She sang to make it *ground*. To make it nourish. Root-vegetable magic. Carrots. Beets.”

Cornelius felt his scales prickle upright. “Carrot cake,” he said. “Dense. Earth-bound. Rich in beta-carotene and gravitational certainty.”

“Exactly,” Mrs. Miller said. She looked down at Pippa. “Baby, do you have your vials? The sparkly dust?”

Pippa nodded, her hand moving to her pinafore pocket. She withdrew the glass vial. The dust inside was no longer violet-green or arterial red. It had shifted to a soft, iridescent pink—the color of comfort, of skin-warmed blankets, of a mug of tea held in steady hands.

“It’s listening,” Pippa whispered. “The story is listening to Mommy.”

“We shall teach it a new ending,” Cornelius said. He turned to Cassius. “Can you construct a carrot cake of sufficient density to anchor three transformed children and one floating boy?”

Cassius wiped his forehead, leaving a streak of flour. “If... if I have help. If the dough is not anxious. If—”

“You will have help,” Cornelius said. He looked at the assembled group. “We require a division of labor. A heist, if you will, executed with bibliographic precision.”

Imelda appeared in the doorway of the Pergola, her presence as sudden and calming as a bookmark sliding into place. She carried an armful of aprons. “The judges are arriving. The Doukas parents are setting up their sketching easels near the Villa. Master Orestes is questioning Kyria about the health code violations. We have perhaps fifty-five minutes.”

“Imelda,” Cornelius said. “You shall manage the perimeter. Delay the judging. Cite... humidity concerns. Dust particles. Any bureaucratic irregularity necessary.”

Imelda nodded, her silver hair catching the kitchen light. “I shall deploy the Index of Minor Infractions.”

“Cassius,” Cornelius continued. “You shall prepare the batter. Mrs. Miller, you shall provide the harmonic resonance—the stirring, the singing, the maternal force required to ground the magic.”

“What about me?” Pippa asked. Her voice was small but no longer broken.

Cornelius reached into his waistcoat and withdrew the brass pen. He held it out, the metal gleaming with a soft, steady light. “You shall edit the manuscript, Pippa. Not with tears this time. With intent. You shall inscribe the new ending directly into the batter using your dust and this pen. You shall write that the Prince returns from the sky. That the Knight lays down his burdens and speaks his name. That the Lady wakes and walks upon the earth.”

Pippa took the pen. Her fingers closed around it with sudden determination. “And the Baker’s Dozen Swans?”

“The swans remain,” Cornelius said. “But they do not fly to the moon. They swim in a lake. A very small, very grounded lake. Made of cream cheese frosting.”

Zeph burst into the Pergola, his hair standing on end, his shirt covered in straw. “The animals are restless,” he panted. “Zeno is digging through the root cellar floor. Lukas keeps trying to fly into the Villa’s upper windows. And Maya... I think Maya is trying to hibernate inside an olive jar.”

“Zeph,” Cornelius said. “You are the Ringmaster of the Camp Olea Educational Menagerie. You shall bring the animals here. Herd them. Guide them. When the cake is ready, they must eat it. All of them. Quickly, before the judges arrive.”

Zeph straightened his spine. He had been carrying the brass pen only yesterday, but now he carried authority differently. “I can get them here. But Cornelius... they’re scared. Zeno keeps braying. He sounds... he sounds like he’s forgetting.”

“Then we must remind him,” Cornelius said. “With sugar and story. Move.”

The kitchen erupted into coordinated chaos.

Cassius flew to the storage bins, his hooves skidding on the tiles. He dragged out sacks of carrots, walnuts, and spices. Mrs. Miller rolled up her sleeves and seized a wooden spoon the size of a cricket bat. She began to hum—not the tuneless sound of before, but a specific, rhythmic melody, the song her mother had used to grind wheat. The sound seemed to settle the flour in its bins, to weight the sugar crystals with extra gravity.

Cornelius positioned himself before the clay beehive ovens. He extended his claws and began to regulate the temperature with precise, draconic control. He blew a thin stream of blue flame—not the feeble puff he had produced during orientation, but a steady, controlled jet of heat that warmed the stone without scorching it. The ovens glowed with a steady, domestic orange.

“Temperature at three hundred and seventy-five degrees,” Cornelius announced. “Regulated to the half-degree. Proceed with mixing.”

Cassius grated carrots with desperate speed, the orange shreds piling up like autumn leaves. Mrs. Miller cracked eggs into a stone bowl, her movements sharp and definitive. Each crack echoed like a punctuation mark. Pippa stood on a stool beside her, the brass pen in one hand and the vial of pink dust in the other.

“What do I write?” Pippa asked.

“The truth,” Cornelius said. He monitored the oven flames, his eyes reflecting the orange glow. “Write that Lukas likes cookies, but he likes them on the ground. Write that Zeno is strong enough to carry his own name. Write that Maya is safe because she is awake, not because she is hidden.”

Pippa uncorked the vial. She sprinkled the pink dust into the batter. It did not glow red or violet. It shimmered like mica in granite—solid, earthy, real. She dipped the brass pen into the mixture and began to stir, her wrist moving in small, precise circles. As she stirred, she whispered.

“Once, there was a boy who was a bird,” she said. “But the ground was soft. The ground was kind. The boy remembered that he had feet. And he came down to walk.”

The batter thickened. The scent of cinnamon and nutmeg filled the Pergola, overwhelming the lingering traces of sea salt and ancient paper. The smell was dense, moist, rooted. It smelled of cellars and harvests and mothers.

“Faster,” Imelda called from the doorway. “Master Orestes is sneezing. He suspects something is amiss with the soufflé presentation.”

Cassius poured the batter into three round pans. Cornelius slid them into the ovens with surgical precision, his claws clicking against the metal racks. “Baking time: twenty-five minutes. No more, no less. Zeph, status of the menagerie?”

Zeph reappeared, leading a small, bedraggled parade. Zeno the donkey trotted behind him, his blue mane tangled with straw, his eyes wild and unfocused. He was followed by Lukas the pigeon, who hopped along the ground rather than flying, his blue bandana dragging in the dust. Behind them, Zeph carried a terracotta pot in which Maya the turtle had retreated, her shell barely visible.

And behind them all came Bennie, no longer bouncing uncontrollably but walking with a careful, deliberate step, his eyes wide as he clutched a piece of stale Floaty-Loaf that had finally lost its levitation.

“They’re here,” Zeph said. “But Cornelius... look at Zeno.”

The small donkey was changing. The blue of his mane was fading, becoming patchy. His hooves were scraping the tiles with a sound that was less equine and more... desperate. He was losing the shape of the Knight, forgetting the story Pippa had written for him.

“He is reverting to the original narrative,” Cornelius said. He checked the oven timer. “The cake must hurry.”

The minutes ticked by with agonizing slowness. Mrs. Miller sang louder. Cassius prepared the cream cheese frosting, beating it with a whisk until his arms trembled. Pippa stood before the oven, the brass pen clutched in both hands, her lips moving silently as she rehearsed the new ending.

Cornelius monitored the heat. His scales felt tight against his body. The pressure of the impending deadline sat upon his chest like a heavy book. He could hear the murmur of voices from the Villa—the parents gathering, the judges assembling their clipboards.

“Time,” Cornelius announced.

He opened the ovens. The carrot cakes emerged, golden-brown and dense, radiating warmth that smelled of earth and safety. Cassius slathered them with frosting, his hands moving in frantic, swirling motions. Mrs. Miller produced a handful of walnuts and pressed them into the sides, each nut clicking into place like a rivet.

Pippa stepped forward. She opened her vial and sprinkled the last of the pink dust over the top tier. Then, with the brass pen, she wrote in the frosting. Not words, exactly, but symbols—small, precise edits. Crossings-out. A swan with its wings folded. A boy with feet on the ground.

“It’s done,” she whispered.

“Zeph,” Cornelius commanded. “Administer the cure.”

Zeph cut the cake into rough slices. He placed the first piece before Zeno the donkey. The animal sniffed it, his ears flattening. Then, with a desperate motion, he bit into the cake.

For a moment, nothing happened. Then the blue mane flickered. The donkey’s form seemed to fold inward, like a page being turned. There was a sound like a book snapping shut.

Zeno stood there. Human. Fourteen years old. Covered in flour and straw and donkey hair, but unmistakably human. His hair was still dyed bright blue, but it was hair, not fur. He looked at his hands. He opened his mouth.

“I,” he said. His voice cracked. “I am Zeno. I am... I am me.”

“Next,” Cornelius said, his heart hammering against his ribs. “Quickly.”

Zeph placed a slice before Lukas the pigeon. The bird pecked at the frosting, then tore at the cake with sudden ferocity. The blue bandana slipped from his neck. There was a puff of pink dust, a smell of cinnamon, and then Lukas was sitting on the tiles, fourteen years old, gangly and human, wearing a tunic that was far too large and covered in feathers.

“Pippa?” he said, looking at his sister.

Pippa ran to him. She threw her arms around his neck. “I’m sorry,” she sobbed. “I’m sorry, I’m sorry.”

Lukas hugged her back, his eyes wide with confusion and relief. “You gave me cookies,” he said. “They were good cookies. But I like them better when I have hands.”

“Maya,” Cornelius urged. “The turtle.”

Zeph placed a small piece of cake on a saucer and slid it into the terracotta pot. For a long moment, the turtle remained withdrawn. Then a small head emerged. She took a bite.

The shell did not fade; it simply... became a dress. A green dress with a pattern that looked like scutes. Maya sat up, twelve years old, blinking in the light, her hair tangled with bits of lettuce.

“I was asleep,” she said. “But I’m awake now. I think... I think I want to be awake.”

“Bennie,” Zeph said, offering the last slice to the small boy who had been bouncing for days.

Bennie ate. The glow faded from his shoes. He settled firmly onto the tiles, no longer hovering. He looked up and smiled. “I like cake,” he said. “Cake is better than flying.”

Cornelius felt his knees weaken. He gripped the edge of the olive press slab to steady himself. The Reversal Cake worked. The children were restored. The narrative had been edited successfully.

But they were not safe yet.

The children sat upon the tiles, disheveled, half-naked in some cases, covered in animal hair and frosting and confusion. Zeno wore only a torn tunic that had fit a donkey. Lukas was swimming in his feather-covered clothes. Maya’s green dress was stained with olive brine.

Imelda appeared in the doorway. Her eyes swept over the scene—the restored children, the triumphant adults, the half-eaten cake—and she smiled. It was a sharp, efficient smile.

“Master Orestes has concluded his inspection of the soufflés,” she announced. “He is turning toward the Pergola. He will be here in ninety seconds.”

Cornelius felt his blood run cold. “They cannot be seen like this. They are naked. They are feral. They are covered in narrative residue.”

“Aprons,” Imelda said.

She threw them.

The garments sailed through the air in a perfect arc—a blue one for Zeno, a red one for Lukas, a green one for Maya, and a small yellow one for Bennie. They landed on the children’s heads, covering their confusion, their nakedness, their recent status as beasts of burden and flight.

“Put them on,” Imelda commanded. “Stand up. Wipe your faces. You are not campers who were recently animals. You are apprentices. You have been... taste-testing. Vigorously.”

Zeno pulled the blue apron over his head. It hung to his knees. He looked at Cornelius, his eyes still holding the wildness of the donkey, but also a new, human understanding. “I remember,” he said. “I remember everything. The hay. The dark. Thank you.”

“Later,” Cornelius said. His voice was tight. “You may thank me later. For now, assume the posture of culinary students. Pippa, hide that pen. Mrs. Miller, resume humming. Cassius, look exhausted but triumphant. Zeph, stand behind them like a supervisor.”

He turned to the olive press slab. The Final Feast cake still stood there, the sugar swans looking suddenly less like creatures of flight and more like decorative, edible statues. The Reversal Cake sat beside it, half-consumed, steaming slightly in the morning air.

Cornelius adjusted his spectacles. He smoothed his waistcoat. He checked his claws for frosting residue and found them clean.

Master Orestes rounded the corner of the Pergola, his Sphinx-kin features severe, his nose twitching.

Cornelius stepped forward, placing himself between the judges and the children. He executed a small, precise bow.

“Master Orestes,” he said. “Welcome to the Bake-Off. I trust you find the humidity within acceptable parameters?”

Orestes looked at the children in their aprons, at the carrot cake, at the sugar swans. He sniffed the air. Cornelius held his breath.

The Sphinx sneezed.

But it was a small sneeze. A dust sneeze. Not a lie sneeze.

“Acceptable,” Orestes said. “Proceed with the judging.”

Cornelius exhaled. Behind him, he heard Pippa whisper to her mother, “Is it over?”

Mrs. Miller’s hand found her daughter’s shoulder. “No, baby,” she said softly. “It’s just beginning. But you’re grounded now. We’re all grounded.”

Cornelius allowed himself a small, private smile. Then he turned to face the judges, his claws clicking against the terracotta tiles in a rhythm of triumph.
