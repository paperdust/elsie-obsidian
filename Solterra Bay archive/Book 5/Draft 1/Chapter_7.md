 Chapter 7

Cornelius Drake arranged the reference volumes upon the oak table with the precision of a jeweler setting stones. The *Encyclopedia of Herpetological Metamorphoses* occupied the leftmost position, its spine aligned exactly parallel to the table’s edge. Beside it rested *Narrative Transmutation: A Bibliomantic Study*, its pages open to a chapter concerning involuntary therianthropy triggered by ingestion of enchanted prose. In the center of this scholarly formation sat a ventilated wooden box lined with straw and silk.

Inside the box, Maya—the turtle—had retreated entirely into her shell.

Cornelius adjusted his spectacles. He peered into the box, his breath stirring the straw. The turtle’s carapace displayed patterns of amber and brown, geometrically pleasing but biologically unhelpful. He required her to emerge. He needed to observe her behavior, to document whether the narrative magic preserved the subject’s cognitive faculties or merely imposed a reptilian overlay upon the human consciousness.

“Maya,” Cornelius said. He kept his voice low, mindful of the library tent’s acoustic properties. The canvas walls dampened sound, but excessive volume disturbed the parchment. “Maya, I require you to extend at least one limb. I must assess your circulatory function.”

The turtle remained a dome of silence.

Cornelius made a notation in his ledger. *Subject exhibits defensive withdrawal consistent with Testudinidae behavior. No observable retention of human anxiety responses.* He underlined the word *anxiety* twice. In her human form, Maya had twisted her tunic hem with nervous energy. As a turtle, she had achieved a state of perfect stoicism. The transformation had, in some respects, improved her psychological resilience.

He reached for his tea. The ceramic cup sat upon a coaster of felted wool, positioned precisely at the corner of the table. The brew was chamomile—pure, unenchanted, sourced from Imelda’s private stores. He sipped. The liquid had cooled to exactly sixty degrees Celsius, optimal for consumption without scalding the delicate mucous membranes of his throat.

The library tent surrounded him with the comforting weight of order. Canvas bags of books lined the walls, each sealed with wax and labeled in his own meticulous script. The dwarven-made lock upon the entrance had been tested three times since dawn. The humidity gauge read forty-two percent—acceptable, though barely. His scales itched slightly, but the sensation remained within manageable parameters.

He was in control.

A scratching at the tent flap interrupted his inventory of the *Minor Keys of Transmutation*.

“Enter,” Cornelius called.

Zeph Taraki pushed through the canvas, his lanky frame dusted with flour and hay. The boy’s hair stood at angles suggesting electrochemical disturbance or prolonged stress. He carried a wicker basket in both hands, held away from his body as if it contained explosives.

“Boss,” Zeph mumbled. He stopped inside the entrance, his boots scattering particulate matter upon the dirt floor.

Cornelius’s scales prickled. “Do not move.”

Zeph froze.

“You are shedding organic debris,” Cornelius said. He set down his tea with a precise click. “The floor of this tent is a controlled environment. I have cataloged seventeen distinct species of mold spore present in the native soil, none of which are compatible with parchment preservation. Step backward onto the threshold.”

Zeph shuffled back until his heels touched the tent flap. “Sorry. I came from the barn.”

“The Sanctuary Barn,” Cornelius corrected. He rose from his cushion, his wings snapping open for balance. “Where you were stationed to monitor the perimeter and care for the... primary subject.”

“Lukas is eating,” Zeph said. “I mean, he’s pecking. He’s pecking enthusiastically.”

Cornelius approached, his claws clicking against the wooden floorboards he had installed himself. He examined the basket. Inside, fragments of Floaty-Loaf drifted gently, hovering two inches above the wicker base. The bread retained its yellow, domestic levitation magic—stable, cozy, predictable.

“You have been feeding him the experimental therapy,” Cornelius said.

“It works,” Zeph said. “He likes the floating crumbs. He hovers with them. It’s like... he remembers being human when he’s weightless.”

Cornelius made a mental notation. *Therapeutic efficacy of domestic levitation confirmed. Subject responds to kinetic memory triggers.* He felt a small warmth in his chest cavity, a sensation he categorized as professional satisfaction.

“You are doing well,” Cornelius said.

Zeph blinked. His mouth opened, then closed. “I am?”

“Your improvised care regimen has stabilized the subject’s condition. It is commendable. However”—Cornelius pointed at the flour dusting Zeph’s shoulders—“your personal hygiene standards remain inadequate. You are dispersing contaminants.”

“I’ll brush off outside,” Zeph said. He hesitated. “Boss? There’s something else. In the barn. Zeno.”

Cornelius stiffened. “The Special Night Watch. Has he violated his containment parameters?”

“No, he’s just... counting things. Loudly. He counted all the hay bales. Then he counted the dust motes. Then he started counting my freckles. It’s been six hours.”

“He is performing his duty,” Cornelius said. “The duty of vigilance requires mental occupation. His mathematical exercises indicate alertness.”

“He asked me if turtles dream,” Zeph said. “He knows about Maya, doesn’t he?”

Cornelius went still. “He knows there is a second transformation. He does not know the specifics. I have classified that information as Level Three Restricted.”

“Right,” Zeph said. He shifted the basket. The floating bread fragments bobbed in the air currents. “Boss? Are you close to figuring it out? The parents arrive in sixty-eight hours. The Council inspection follows immediately.”

Cornelius turned to his ledger. He flipped through pages of interrogation notes, suspect profiles, and chemical analyses. “I have eliminated Thais Doukas and Vasilis. Thirteen suspects remain. The pattern is emerging. The culprit exhibits knowledge of culinary alchemy, access to restricted ingredients, and a propensity for chaotic disruption.”

“You still think it’s Zeno?” Zeph asked.

“Zeno is the primary vector,” Cornelius said. “However, I suspect accomplices. The complexity of the narrative magic suggests collaboration. The rogue crumb from Lukas’s donut exhibited properties of sea salt and ancient paper—bibliomantic contamination. Zeno cannot read.”

Zeph frowned. “So you’re looking for someone who reads?”

“I am looking for variables,” Cornelius said. “Unstable elements. Individuals who interact with texts in unsupervised environments.”

He moved to the sideboard. The reject Mood-Muffins sat in their basket, arranged in geometric precision. Pippa’s work. The iridescent dust upon their surfaces caught the lamplight, shifting between violet and green. Decorative. Harmless. A child’s gesture of tidiness.

“The afternoon shift will require refreshment,” Cornelius said. “These muffins have been enhanced with aesthetic improvements. They are suitable for distribution.”

Zeph peered at the basket. “They’re sparkly.”

“Pippa applied decorative sugar,” Cornelius said. “She is a constant. Reliable. Orderly. She arranged them with mathematical precision.”

“Right,” Zeph said slowly. “The quiet one. Who likes helping.”

“Exactly,” Cornelius said. He felt a surge of confidence. Here was proof that his system functioned. While chaos agents like Zeno required containment, constants like Pippa provided structural support. “You may take three muffins to the Sanctuary Barn. One for yourself, one for Zeno, and one for... emergency purposes. The remainder will be served at the afternoon assembly.”

Zeph reached for the basket. His hand hovered over the iridescent muffins. “Are you sure? About the sugar?”

“Do not question the aesthetic choices of reliable personnel,” Cornelius said. “It undermines morale. Take your allotment and return to your post. I must continue my research into reversal protocols.”

Zeph withdrew his hand without taking a muffin. “I’ll just... take the bread to Lukas. He’s waiting.”

“Very well,” Cornelius said. “But brush yourself thoroughly before re-entering this tent. I mean it, Zephyr. No particulate matter.”

Zeph backed out through the flap, the basket of floating bread clutched to his chest. Cornelius heard him sneeze twice, then the sound of vigorous brushing against the tent exterior.

Alone again, Cornelius returned to Maya’s box. The turtle had extended her head slightly, her eyes blinking with reptilian patience. He offered her a fragment of lettuce from a sealed container. She accepted it, chewing with slow, methodical movements.

“There,” Cornelius said. “You see? Order provides sustenance. We shall have you restored to human form before your parents arrive. I have calculated a seventy-three percent probability of success, provided I locate the correct bibliomantic counter-resonance.”

The turtle swallowed. She did not appear reassured, but she did not retreat into her shell. Cornelius took this as agreement.

He turned to his books. *Narrative Transmutation* offered several promising leads. The chapter on “Story-Induced Avian Transformation” suggested that the subject’s condition could be reversed through exposure to the narrative’s opposite—if the transformation resulted from a story about flight, grounding rituals might apply. For Lukas, the pigeon, this meant earth magic, stone circles, perhaps a diet of root vegetables.

But Maya was different. She had become a turtle—a creature of retreat, of hibernation, of carrying one’s home as armor. The Sleepy-Time Squares had induced sleep; the narrative had literalized sleep as protective withdrawal. To reverse her condition, he needed a story of awakening, of emergence, of spring after winter.

He reached for his index cards. He began to draft a protocol.

A thumping sound interrupted his concentration.

Thump. Thump-thump. Thump.

Cornelius raised his head. The sound came from outside, rhythmic and percussive, accompanied by high-pitched laughter. He checked his chronometer. 2:47 PM. The afternoon shift of campers should be in the Pergola for their scheduled lesson on *Basic Fermentation Safety*.

Thump. Thump-thump.

Cornelius rose. He secured the turtle’s box with a wooden lid—ventilated, of course—and moved to the tent flap. He pushed through into the afternoon light.

Bennie was hopping.

The small boy moved across the central clearing in great, arcing bounds. Both feet left the ground simultaneously. He achieved heights of approximately three feet per hop, his knees tucked to his chest, his arms windmilling for balance. A trail of faintly glowing crumbs fell behind him, drifting to the earth like phosphorescent snow.

Other campers had gathered. They pointed. They laughed. Thais was sketching the trajectory of Bennie’s leaps with her pencil, her eyes narrowed in analytical fascination.

“Bennie has springs!” someone shouted.

“He’s part rabbit!”

Cornelius marched forward. “Halt!”

Bennie landed directly in front of him, his face flushed, his eyes bright. “Mr. Cornelius! I can fly! Well, not fly. Bounce! Pippa gave me special bread and now I bounce!”

Cornelius’s scales prickled. He looked at the ground. The glowing crumbs formed a trail leading back toward the olive tree where he had observed Pippa comforting the boy earlier.

“You consumed the modified Floaty-Loaf,” Cornelius said.

“It was stale,” Bennie said. “But Pippa made it pretty. And now I’m bouncy!”

He demonstrated by leaping straight upward. Cornelius had to sidestep to avoid collision. The boy reached a height of four feet, hovered for a moment with a look of delighted surprise, then descended.

“Gravity,” Cornelius said, “is not optional.”

“It feels optional,” Bennie said. He hopped in a circle around Cornelius. “Can I keep it? The bounciness? It’s better than sleeping. Maya likes sleeping, but I like bouncing!”

Cornelius seized the boy’s wrist as he passed. He felt the pulse—elevated, but regular. He examined the eyes—dilated, but responsive. He sniffed the breath. Sugar. Yeast. And something else. A faint scent of... violets?

No. Impossible. Pippa’s decorative sugar was sucrose-based. The hopping was merely excitability. A sugar rush. A temporary metabolic spike.

“Cease this activity immediately,” Cornelius commanded. “You will exhaust your glycogen stores. You will experience a crash. You will require a nap.”

“I don’t need a nap!” Bennie shouted. He broke free and bounded toward the treehouse cabins, his laughter trailing behind him like the glowing crumbs.

Cornelius watched him go. The trail of crumbs led across the grass, under the olive tree, toward the Pergola. Toward the sideboard where the dusted muffins waited.

His internal chronometer ticked. Sixty-seven hours remaining.

He turned back toward the library tent. He needed to consult *Pediatric Alchemical Reactions*. He needed to verify whether enhanced glucose absorption could produce temporary anti-gravitational effects in juvenile metabolisms. He needed to confirm that Pippa’s decorative sugar was, in fact, inert.

As he walked, he passed the olive tree. Something glinted at its base. He stopped.

A small glass vial lay upon the roots. Empty. It caught the afternoon light and fractured it into violet and green.

Cornelius picked it up. He turned it in his claws. It was identical to the vial Pippa had used to decorate Maya’s brownie. Identical to the vial she had used to tidy the muffins.

Empty.

He frowned. She had used the entire supply, then. Thorough. Complete. No waste.

He tucked the vial into his own pocket. Evidence, perhaps, of her helpful nature. Her attention to detail. Her status as a constant.

Inside the library tent, Maya the turtle had pushed against the lid of her box. She was trying to get out. Cornelius secured the latch with a small brass hook.

“Patience,” he told her. “I am close to solving this. The pattern is clear. The culprit is identified. The camp is secure.”

He sat down. He picked up his tea. It had cooled to forty degrees—too cold. He set it aside.

From the Sanctuary Barn, he heard a distant cooing. Lukas, the pigeon, singing to the floating bread. From the Girls’ Dorm, silence—no screams, no transformations, no chaos.

From the Pergola, the sound of campers gathering for afternoon snack time.

Cornelius opened his ledger. He wrote: *Day Three. Progress optimal. Suspects narrowed. Security maintained. Restoration imminent.*

He underlined the word *imminent* three times.

Then he took out his polishing cloth and began to clean his spectacles, waiting for the afternoon to unfold exactly according to plan.
