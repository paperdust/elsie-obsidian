Chapter 15

Cornelius Drake sat upon the terracotta tiles of the Stone Villa porch, his wings folded tight against his sides, his spectacles sliding down his snout. He lacked the energy to push them up. The night air pressed heavy against his scales, thick with the scent of olive leaves and the distant, yeasty promise of Cassius’s emergency dough. Inside the Villa, the Doukas parents slept in the eastern wing, their sketchbooks closed but their artistic scrutiny merely paused. Below them, in the root cellar, Zeno the donkey shifted against stone walls, his hooves scraping a nervous rhythm against the dark.

Cornelius should have been cataloging. He should have been updating his third ledger with the day’s disasters, noting the viscosity of fear in Cassius’s aborted dough, or the precise decibel level of Zeno’s bray. Instead, he sat frozen, a bronze statue of exhaustion, while the sounds of the camp settled around him like dust upon a neglected manuscript.

Pippa sat two tiles away. She had not moved since beginning her story, her small body curled around the gold-edged book like a protective sigil. The lamplight from the window behind them caught the gilt lettering on the spine: *The Baker’s Dozen Swans*. The pages were soft with wear, their edges feathered from countless thumbings.

“Once,” Pippa whispered, “there was a Prince who loved the sky.”

Cornelius’s ear twitched. He did not open his eyes. He was too tired to maintain his vigilance, too depleted to insist upon order. He let the words wash over him, a tide of narrative carrying him toward unconsciousness.

“He climbed the highest towers,” Pippa read. “He measured the clouds. He wished only to fly above his father’s kingdom, to see the world from above, to be as light as thistledown. And so, on the night of the great feast, when the Baker served the sweetbread, the Prince ate a crumb that had been blessed by the wind. He turned into a bird with a blue scarf about his neck, and he flew from the highest window, never to land again in the same place twice.”

Cornelius’s eyes opened. His tail, which had been still against the tiles, gave a single, sharp twitch.

He sat up. The movement was jerky, uncoordinated, sending his spectacles askew. He pushed them back into place with one claw, staring at Pippa. The girl did not look up. Her finger traced the woodcut illustration on the page: a young man in princely raiment, half-transformed into a pigeon, a scrap of blue cloth tied about his throat.

“Lukas,” Cornelius said. His voice emerged as a rasp, stripped of its usual formal precision.

Pippa nodded, still reading. “The Prince was happy, but he was lost. He could not remember how to be a boy. He only knew the wind.”

Cornelius’s scales prickled upright along his spine. He leaned forward, his exhaustion evaporating like morning dew from hot stone. The scent reached him then—that distinct, sharp aroma he had first detected in Chapter Two, clinging to the rogue crumb from Lukas’s pillow. *Sea salt and old paper*. The smell of archives, of scrolls, of stories leaking into reality.

“Continue,” Cornelius commanded. He did not mean to bark, but the word came out sharp, a librarian’s order to a recalcitrant patron.

Pippa turned the page. The paper made a sound like a sigh. “There was also a Knight,” she read, her voice dropping to a reverent hush. “A strong Knight who carried the burdens of all the realm. He bore the sacks of flour, the barrels of wine, the weight of every sorrow. He never complained. But he was tired. So tired. And on the night of the feast, the Baker gave him a muffin with a burden baked inside. The Knight became a small donkey with a blue mane, strong and stubborn, carrying loads forever, unable to speak his own name.”

Zeno. The donkey in the cellar. The boy who had eaten the Mood-Muffins decorated with iridescent dust.

Cornelius felt his claws dig into the terracotta. A chip of tile cracked beneath his grip. “The Lady,” he said. “Is there a Lady in this tale?”

Pippa looked up, her eyes wide and dark in the lamplight. “Yes,” she said. “The Lady who loved sleep. Who was afraid of the dark, and so hid inside her shell. She ate the sleeping cake and became a turtle, carrying her home upon her back, retreating into silence.”

Maya. The turtle in the ventilated box in the library tent.

The pattern clicked into place with the force of a dwarven lock engaging. Cornelius stood up. His legs trembled, but he stood, his wings half-furled for balance. He looked down at the book, at Pippa’s small hands holding it, at the woodcut illustrations that seemed to shift in the flickering light.

“It is not the sprinkles,” Cornelius said. His voice was hollow with realization. “It was never the sprinkles. It was the *text*.”

He had been so certain. He had cataloged the violet-green dust, the iridescent vials, the decorative sugar. He had blamed the medium, the carrier, the vector. He had tested the muffins, analyzed the crumbs, confiscated the glass vials. But he had allowed the book to remain. He had said, “Just words, no sprinkles,” believing that without the dust, the danger was contained.

He had not accounted for a child’s wish for a happy ending. He had not accounted for Narrative Physics.

“You are not a saboteur,” Cornelius said, looking at Pippa with new eyes. “You are a... a Narrative Mage. An unconscious channel. The stories are not tales you read. They are instructions you give to reality.”

Pippa blinked. “I just read the stories,” she said. “I just want them to have happy endings. The Prince should fly. The Knight should be strong. The Lady should be safe.”

“But they are not safe,” Cornelius said. He stepped closer, his shadow falling across the open pages. “They are transformed. They are lost inside their roles. Just as Lukas is lost in feathers, and Zeno is lost in braying, and Maya is lost in her shell.”

He looked at the book. The scent of burnt sugar and ancient paper grew stronger, heady and cloying. It was the smell of magic activating, of narrative asserting itself over the physical world.

“What happens next?” Cornelius demanded. He reached out with one claw, hovering over the page but not touching it, as if the paper might burn him. “What happens at the end of this tale? After the feast? After the transformations?”

Pippa turned the page. Her finger traced the final illustration. “The Baker’s Dozen Swans,” she read, her voice trembling now. “The Baker loved his swans too much. He baked them into a great cake, a cake so light it floated. And when the King ate of it, the entire kingdom—the castle, the towers, the gardens, all the people—rose into the sky and flew to the moon, where they would be safe forever from sorrow and harm.”

Cornelius went very still. His tail froze mid-twitch. The air in his throat felt like sand.

“The moon,” he repeated.

“To be safe,” Pippa whispered. “So nothing bad can ever happen. A happy ending.”

Cornelius looked toward the kitchen. Through the window, he could see Cassius moving in the lamplight, preparing the dough for tomorrow’s Parent Showcase. The final cake. The great feast. The culminating moment when all the parents—the Doukas parents, the others who would arrive—would gather to eat the children’s creations.

If Pippa read that ending, if she reached the final page while the cake was being served, while the feast was underway...

The camp would fly away. The Stone Villa, the Sanctuary Barn, the library tent with all his books, the children, the parents, the entire compound—it would all lift into the air like thistledown and vanish into the lunar void. All to satisfy a child’s wish for safety. All to give them a “happy ending” free from harm.

He had been hunting a villain who did not exist. He had accused Zeno of sabotage, suspected Kyria of conspiracy, blamed the sprinkles and the dust and the yeast. But the true danger sat before him on the porch steps: a nine-year-old girl with a storybook, whispering reality into existence.

“Stop,” Cornelius said. His voice was quiet but absolute, the tone he used for rare manuscripts on the verge of crumbling to dust. “Do not turn the page. Do not read another word.”

Pippa looked up at him, her lower lip trembling. “But I have to finish the story,” she said. “The Baker’s Dozen Swans must fly. They have to be safe. That’s how it ends.”

“That is not safety,” Cornelius said. He stepped forward, placing himself between Pippa and the lamplight, casting the book into shadow. “That is annihilation. To fly to the moon, to remove oneself from the world—that is not a happy ending. That is escape. That is... shelving.”

He thought of his library, of his hoard, of the precious books he kept sealed in wax and canvas to protect them from humidity and time. He had been trying to seal the camp in the same way. He had tried to place Zeno in the root cellar, to hide Lukas in the rafters, to tuck Maya away in a ventilated box. He had been trying to catalog the children, to file them away where they could not be damaged.

He had been trying to write his own story of control, and Pippa had been writing a story of flight.

“We cannot fly to the moon,” Cornelius said. He reached out with his claws, not to take the book—that might trigger the magic, might force the ending—but to gently close the cover. “We must remain here. On the ground. Where it is messy, and dangerous, and humid, and imperfect. That is where the story continues. Not in the safe silence of the shelves, but in the loud, chaotic, unwritten pages of tomorrow.”

Pippa clutched the book to her chest. “But what happens to the Prince? To the Knight? To the Lady?”

“They return,” Cornelius said. He spoke with a certainty he did not feel, but which he knew he must manufacture. He thought of the Floaty-Loaf crumbs that had calmed Lukas, of the gentle patience Zeph had shown Zeno, of the way Maya had pushed against the lid of her box. “They find their way back from the story. Not by flying away, but by... by being found. By being known. By someone reading them correctly.”

He looked at the book. The gold edges glinted. The scent of old paper and burnt sugar hung in the air like a threat, or a promise.

“You are the Reader,” Cornelius said. “But you are also the Writer. And you must choose a different ending. One where the kingdom stays. Where the swans swim in the pond, not fly to the moon. Where the children come home.”

Pippa looked down at the book. Her hands were small, and they trembled against the leather cover. “I don’t know how to write a different ending,” she whispered. “The stories are too loud. They want to be told.”

“Then tell a new one,” Cornelius said. He reached into his waistcoat and withdrew his brass pen—the same instrument he had given to Zeph, the same tool he used to catalog his hoard. He held it out to Pippa. “Write it in the margins. Edit the manuscript. You have that power. You are not merely a vessel for the tale. You are its master.”

Pippa stared at the pen. It gleamed in the dim light, heavy and real, an instrument of order in a world of chaotic narrative.

From the root cellar below, Zeno brayed—a soft, questioning sound, not of distress but of confusion. From the rafters of the Villa, Lukas cooed. Inside the library tent, Maya scratched against her box.

The camp was listening. The story was waiting.

Pippa reached out and took the pen.
