 Chapter 6

Cornelius Drake arranged the interrogation chamber with the precision of a master cartographer mapping contested territory. The Stone Villa’s eastern receiving room offered optimal conditions for forensic interview work. The terracotta tiles retained a cool, stable temperature conducive to clear thought. The plaster walls, though crumbling in places, provided adequate acoustic dampening. Most importantly, the heavy oak table presented a surface of sufficient size for his evidence display.

He placed three Mood-Muffins upon a ceramic plate at exact equidistant intervals. The pastries were a pedagogical tool developed by the Council’s Culinary Oversight Committee—enchanted baked goods calibrated to shift hue based upon the consumer’s emotional state. A baseline yellow indicated calm. Crimson suggested aggression or deception. Violet denoted creative anxiety. Cornelius had modified the recipe slightly, adding a trace of truth-verification root to the batter. The muffins now served as both psychological barometer and lie detector.

He adjusted his spectacles. The lenses magnified the muffins’ surfaces, revealing the faint magical shimmer of the enchantment. Today, he would narrow the field of suspects. Zeno remained confined to the Sanctuary Barn under the guise of Special Night Watch—a necessary containment measure. However, Cornelius harbored a professional certainty that the satyr-kin had not acted alone. The complexity of the narrative magic required either accomplices or, at minimum, willfully blind enablers.

He consulted his ledger. Seventeen campers remained under active consideration. He had eliminated Pippa immediately; her file indicated a stable, bookish disposition, and her behavior throughout the crisis had demonstrated consistent helpfulness. She was a constant, not a variable. That left sixteen possibilities.

Thais Doukas entered the room with the methodical tread of a surveyor. She carried her sketchbook pressed against her ribs, her pencil tucked behind her ear. She moved with the precision of a compass needle finding north.

“Sit,” Cornelius commanded, gesturing to the chair opposite the muffins.

Thais sat. She placed her sketchbook upon the table and opened it to a fresh page. Her eyes, dark and intense, fixed upon the pastries.

“State your full name for the record,” Cornelius said.

“Thais Eleni Doukas.”

“Age and magical pedigree.”

“Fifteen. Dryad-touched, third generation through the maternal line. Minor botanical affinity, primarily expressed through artistic precision.”

Cornelius made a notation. “You will consume one Mood-Muffin. You will describe its flavor profile in detail. You will then answer my questions regarding your whereabouts during the Sleepy-Time Square incident.”

Thais selected the leftmost muffin. She examined it with the same analytical attention she applied to architectural drawings. She took a precise bite.

The muffin shifted color immediately. It settled into a deep, steady amber—not the aggressive red of deceit, but the concentrated gold of intense intellectual focus.

“Cardamom,” Thais said. “With undertones of burnt sugar and a finish of iron. The texture is dense, approximately 1.3 times the specific gravity of standard quick bread.”

Cornelius leaned forward. “Did you tamper with the brownies served in the Pergola yesterday evening?”

“No.”

“Did you supply Zeno with any alchemical agents, restricted substances, or narrative catalysts?”

“No.”

“Did you observe any other camper engaging in suspicious behavior near the dessert preparation area?”

Thais chewed thoughtfully. The muffin remained amber. “Pippa helped serve the plates. She was efficient. I noted the geometric arrangement of the brownies upon the tray. They formed a Fibonacci spiral. That is all.”

Cornelius made another notation. Thais’s responses aligned with her established psychological profile—overachieving, detail-oriented, devoid of chaotic impulse. The amber hue confirmed cognitive engagement without emotional volatility. She was not an accomplice. She was merely a witness with poor observational priorities.

“You are dismissed,” Cornelius said. “Return to your architectural studies.”

Thais stood, bowed slightly, and departed. Cornelius crossed her name from his ledger with a satisfying stroke of his claw. Fourteen suspects remained.

Vasilis entered next. The Cyprian elf moved with the cautious gait of one perpetually aware of environmental hazards. He carried a cloth satchel marked with allergen warnings in three languages. His eyes were red-rimmed, his posture defensive.

“Sit,” Cornelius said.

Vasilis sat upon the edge of the chair, ready to bolt. “I brought my own rations. The muffins contain gluten. And possibly nuts. I have a sensitivity index—”

“You will consume the muffin,” Cornelius said. “I have prepared a specialized batch using rice flour and synthetic binding agents. It is allergen-neutral.”

Vasilis hesitated. He reached for the center muffin with trembling fingers. He took the smallest possible bite.

The muffin turned a pale, tremulous blue—the color of shallow water over sand. Anxiety. Apprehension. But not guilt.

“Describe the flavor,” Cornelius commanded.

“Bland,” Vasilis whispered. “Like wet paper. With a hint of... lemon? No, citron. Preserved citron peel.”

“Did you sabotage the Sleepy-Time Squares?”

“No! I never touch communal food. The cross-contamination risks alone—”

“Did you assist Zeno in any capacity regarding the transformation of Maya into a Testudinidae?”

“I avoid Zeno. He is loud. Loud noises trigger my histamine response.”

Cornelius studied the blue muffin. The color remained consistent, shifting only to a slightly deeper azure when Vasilis mentioned Zeno—indicating fear, not complicity. The elf’s hands trembled. His pupils were dilated. He was a victim of circumstance, not a perpetrator.

“You are dismissed,” Cornelius said. “Return to your cabin. Avoid the Pergola until the particulate hazard from yesterday’s Sparkroot incident has fully dissipated.”

Vasilis fled. Cornelius crossed off another name. Thirteen suspects remained.

He rose from the table and stretched his wings. The interview process required intense concentration, and his scales had begun to itch with the prickle of mental fatigue. He needed tea. He needed to reorganize his evidence bags. He needed to verify that the reject muffins—the two uneaten portions from Thais and Vasilis—were properly disposed of or secured.

He turned toward the kitchen alcove. There, he discovered Pippa.

The small girl stood beside the reject basket, her pigtails dusted with flour, her hands moving with the quick, efficient motions of a librarian shelving returned books. She had arranged the uneaten Mood-Muffins into neat rows. More significantly, she had produced a small glass vial from her pinafore pocket—the same vial, Cornelius noted with approval, that she had used to decorate Maya’s dessert two nights prior. She sprinkled a minute quantity of iridescent dust upon the rejected pastries.

The substance shimmered violet-green in the dim light of the Villa. It caught the rays filtering through the blue shutters and fractured them into constituent colors. Pippa worked with her tongue protruding slightly between her teeth, her expression one of intense concentration.

“What are you doing?” Cornelius asked.

Pippa started, then smiled. Her face was the picture of earnest helpfulness. “Tidying, Mr. Cornelius. The muffins looked sad just thrown in the basket. I’m making them pretty for later. It’s just pretty sugar. For the next people.”

Cornelius approached the basket. He examined her work. The muffins were indeed arranged with geometric precision. The iridescent dust lay atop them in a thin, even layer, creating a decorative sparkle that caught the light. It was tidy. It was orderly. It demonstrated an instinct for organization that Cornelius found deeply reassuring.

“That is commendable,” Cornelius said. “Waste not, want not. The decorative treatment improves the aesthetic value of the rejected samples. You may place them upon the sideboard. We shall offer them to the afternoon shift of campers.”

“Yes, Mr. Cornelius,” Pippa said. She lifted the basket with both hands, her small arms straining under the weight, and carried it to the sideboard. She placed it precisely parallel to the wall’s edge, then adjusted it three millimeters to the left. Perfect alignment.

“You are a constant, Pippa,” Cornelius said. “A fixed point in a chaotic system. I appreciate your assistance.”

Pippa beamed. She tucked the empty vial back into her pocket. “I like helping. Everything should be pretty and safe.”

“Indeed,” Cornelius said. He turned to prepare his tea.

He selected a tin of dried mint from the shelf. The leaves were crisp, properly desiccated, stored in a hermetically sealed container. He measured exactly one teaspoon into a ceramic strainer. He poured water heated to precisely eighty-eight degrees Celsius—hot enough to extract essential oils, cool enough to avoid bitterness. The aroma filled the receiving room: sharp, clean, organized.

He carried his cup to the window. The blue shutters stood open, revealing the central camp grounds. From this vantage point, he could observe the Pergola, the olive trees, and the path leading to the Sanctuary Barn. He could verify that Zeno remained in his assigned containment area, and that Zeph maintained proper perimeter security.

Instead, he observed a scene of distress beneath the largest olive tree.

Bennie, a camper of approximately eight years, sat upon the exposed roots, weeping. The boy clutched a fragment of Floaty-Loaf—the bread from yesterday’s demonstration—in his small hands. The bread had gone stale, hard as a stone. Bennie’s shoulders shook with the violence of his sobs.

Pippa approached the boy. Cornelius watched, his tea steaming before him, as the girl knelt beside the distressed camper. She removed the stale bread from Bennie’s grip. She produced her vial again—the iridescent dust glittering in the afternoon light. She whispered something to Bennie, her mouth close to his ear. Cornelius could not hear the words through the window, but he observed the gesture: comforting, gentle, sisterly.

Pippa sprinkled the dust upon the stale Floaty-Loaf. The bread seemed to soften, though Cornelius attributed this to the angle of the light, or perhaps to Pippa kneading it with her small fingers. She handed the bread back to Bennie. The boy took a bite. He stopped crying. He smiled.

Then Bennie began to hop.

He did not walk away from the tree. He hopped. Both feet left the ground simultaneously. He bounced across the grass like a rubber ball, still clutching the bread, his tears forgotten, a grin splitting his face. He hopped toward the treehouse cabins, then back toward the olive tree, then in a circle around Pippa, who watched with her hands clasped, smiling.

Cornelius sipped his tea. He adjusted his spectacles. The boy’s behavior was consistent with a sugar rush—a sudden spike in glucose levels following the consumption of carbohydrates. The iridescent dust was likely a crystalline sucrose compound. The hopping was merely childish excitability, a physical expression of relief after emotional distress.

He turned away from the window. He had work to do. He had thirteen more suspects to interview, and only seventy-two hours remained until the parents arrived and the Council inspection began. He could not afford to waste time observing playground antics.

He returned to the table. He opened his ledger to the next name: Markos, heir to House Veneti. He placed a fresh Mood-Muffin upon the plate. He prepared his questions.

Behind him, on the sideboard, the reject muffins sat in their basket, dusted with violet-green iridescence, waiting for the afternoon shift. Outside, Bennie hopped past the window, his feet leaving the ground in defiance of gravity, a trail of faint, glowing crumbs falling behind him like breadcrumbs leading into a dark forest.

Cornelius did not see. He was busy. He was in control. He was the master sleuth, and the mystery was nearly solved.
