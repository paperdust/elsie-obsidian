The dust coated Cornelius Drake’s scales with a film of ochre grime that he found personally offensive. He marched along the winding dirt track with precise, indignant steps, his wings folded tight against his flanks to prevent the brush of olive branches from smudging his burnished bronze hide further. The path wound through the ancient grove like a serpent, and with every twist, the humidity climbed, pressing against his snout with the subtlety of a damp wool blanket.

"I must register a formal complaint," Cornelius announced, adjusting his custom spectacles with a claw. The lenses, ground specifically to correct his vision for the delicate work of cataloging, slid down his snout despite his efforts. He pushed them up again. "This atmosphere is unacceptable. The moisture content must be approaching eighty percent. Do you understand what this will do to the parchment? The glue in the bindings? The very integrity of the collection I have agreed to bring?"

Zephyr "Zeph" Taraki trudged three paces ahead, his shoulders hunched under a canvas pack that clanked with the sound of metal cookware. The boy did not turn around. "Yeah, Boss. You mentioned it. Like, twelve times since the library."

"And I shall mention it a thirteenth if necessary," Cornelius said. He stepped over a root that had erupted through the soil like a gnarled knuckle. "The travel chests are sealed with wax, but even wax has its limits. I have first editions in there. First editions, Zeph. They are not designed for jungle conditions."

"We're in an olive grove," Zeph mumbled. He kicked a stone, sending it skittering into the underbrush. "And it's not even that far from town. Just because you can't see the water doesn't mean the air changes."

"The air changes precisely when one cannot see the water," Cornelius corrected. He flexed his toes, feeling the grit between his claws. "The absence of the thermal regulation provided by the coastal breeze creates a pocket of stagnation. It is elementary physics. One would think a student of your standing would comprehend basic meteorological principles."

Zeph stopped walking. He turned, his dark face flushed from exertion, sweat beading on his forehead. The boy's unruly black hair, which possessed an unnatural metallic bronze sheen that Cornelius suspected was the result of some cheap cosmetic product, stuck to his temples. "Look, we're almost there, okay? Can we just... not? For like, five minutes? The kids are going to be way worse than humidity."

Cornelius preened a scale on his forearm, smoothing it back into alignment. "I am attempting to establish parameters. Order must be imposed before the chaos descends. Once we reach this rustic encampment, there will be no time for proper organization. I must ensure you understand the severity of our archival situation."

"Sure," Zeph said. He turned and resumed walking. "Super severe."

The path opened without warning. One moment they were enclosed in a tunnel of silver-green leaves, the next they stood in a clearing that Cornelius assessed with a critical eye. The Old Olive Press sprawled before them, a collection of structures that offended his sense of architectural symmetry. The Stone Villa, which would serve as the Lodge, leaned slightly to the left, its pink plaster crumbling in a manner that suggested terminal decline rather than rustic charm. The Treehouse Cabins perched in the branches of the ancient olives like abandoned nests, connected by rope bridges that swayed in a breeze Cornelius could not feel but could see moving the leaves. The Pergola, an open-air stone patio dominated by a massive circular press stone, teemed with activity.

Chaos had already arrived.

"Health code violation," said a voice to Cornelius's left. "The stone slab shows evidence of insufficient sterilization. I can see organic matter in the crevices. Likely olive residue from previous seasons. Unsanitary."

Cornelius turned his head. Little Kyria Varka stood with a notebook pressed against her chest, her tusks—small and polished to a pearly sheen for one so young—gleaming as she wrote with a pencil that looked like a matchstick in her orcish grip. She wore a crisp white tunic that appeared freshly pressed despite the hike, and her hair was braided with military precision.

"Kyria," Cornelius said. "I was not informed you would be conducting inspections prior to the official start of the camp."

"I go where the violations are," Kyria said. She snapped her notebook shut. "The Council sent me to observe. My aunt wants to know if this 'experimental culinary program' is worth the grant money. So far, I see dust, insects, and what appears to be moss growing on the north-facing wall of that barn."

"That is patina," Cornelius said. "It adds character."

"It adds spores," Kyria corrected. She walked toward the Villa, her boots crunching on the gravel.

Zeph exhaled through his nose. "Great. We have a spy."

"We have an observer," Cornelius amended. "And we shall give her nothing to observe but perfect efficiency. Where is the inventory manifest?"

"I have it," Imelda Kassiani called from the Villa's porch.

The Head Librarian stood in the shade of the overhang, her silver-white hair catching the light in intricate braids adorned with copper beads. At one hundred eighty-seven years, Imelda possessed the kind of stillness that made the air around her seem calmer. Her nut-brown skin, lined with the maps of centuries, creased as she smiled. She held a clipboard in one hand and a cup of mint tea in the other.

"Everything is accounted for," Imelda said. "The books are in the library tent. The kitchen supplies are under lock and key. The sleeping arrangements are... adequate."

"Adequate is not a word I associate with success," Cornelius said. He trotted up the steps, his claws clicking against the terracotta tiles. "Show me the library tent. I must ensure the humidity has not already begun its destructive work."

"After the opening circle," Imelda said. "The children are gathering."

Cornelius's tail twitched. "Already? We have not established protocols. We have not distributed the schedules. We have not—"

"Relax, Lizard," said a new voice. "You're going to pop a scale."

Cornelius froze. He turned slowly, his golden eyes narrowing behind his spectacles. A young satyr-kin leaned against the Villa's railing, his hooves crossed at the ankles, his fingers drumming a rhythm against the wood that Cornelius found instantly irritating. The boy's hair was dyed a shade of blue that occurred nowhere in nature, and his grin displayed too many teeth.

"Zeno," Cornelius said. "I presume. You are early."

"Got here last night," Zeno said. He pushed off the railing and landed on the tiles with a clatter of hooves. "Wanted to scope out the kitchen. You know, for strategic purposes."

"Strategic purposes do not involve premature access to the facilities," Cornelius said. "And please stop tapping. That rhythm is irregular."

Zeno increased the tempo. "This? This is just energy, Boss. I've got lots of it."

"Contain it," Cornelius commanded. "Where are the others? We have a schedule."

"They're around," Zeno said. He pointed toward the Pergola. "Lukas is already trying to raid the snack stores. Thais is measuring the angles of the roof with some kind of instrument. And the quiet one... Pippa, right? She's under a tree reading something with sparkles on it."

"Reading is acceptable," Cornelius said. "Raiding stores is not. Measuring angles is..." He paused. "Acceptable, provided she does not damage the structure. We shall begin the orientation immediately."

Cornelius marched toward the central gathering space, a circular area of packed earth surrounded by low stone walls that served as benches. The campers were indeed assembling, though "assembling" suggested a level of organization that did not exist. A tall, thin girl with her hair pulled back in a severe bun stood with her back to the group, sketching the Villa's facade onto a pad with aggressive strokes of charcoal. Thais Doukas, Cornelius remembered from the roster. Artistic temperament. Potentially disruptive.

A boy of perhaps fourteen sat on one of the stone walls, his legs swinging, a crumb of something stuck to the corner of his mouth. Lukas Miller. He waved at Cornelius with a sticky hand.

"Hey, little dragon!" Lukas called. "You brought the books?"

"I am not 'little,'" Cornelius said. "I am precisely the correct size for my species. And yes, the books are secured. Do not touch them."

"Sure, sure," Lukas said. He wiped his mouth with his sleeve, leaving a streak of sugar. "Got any snacks in there? I'm starving."

"The nutritional schedule will be distributed at the appropriate time," Cornelius said. He climbed onto the central stone press, which served as a podium, and spread his wings to their full three-foot span. The gesture was meant to command attention. It mostly attracted flies.

Zeph hovered at the edge of the circle, looking miserable. Imelda stood by the Villa's entrance, watching with her patient expression. Little Kyria had positioned herself on a wall with her notebook ready.

"Welcome to Camp Olea," Cornelius began. His voice carried the authority of one accustomed to shushing noisy patrons in marble halls. "I am Cornelius Drake, Archivist and Administrator of this program. For the next two weeks, this facility will operate under strict guidelines designed to maximize educational output while minimizing risk to life, limb, and literature. You will find your schedules posted in the common area. You will adhere to the quiet hours. You will not—absolutely not—tamper with the magical ingredients in the kitchen without direct supervision."

Zeno raised his hand. "What if it's an accident?"

"There are no accidents," Cornelius said. "There are only failures of preparation. You will address me as Master Drake, or Sir. You will address Counselor Zeph as..."

He paused. He had not actually decided what Zeph should be called.

"Zeph is fine," Zeph muttered.

"Counselor Taraki," Cornelius overrode. "We shall begin with the inventory of supplies. Form a single file line. No talking. No fidgeting. We shall proceed with dignity."

The children stared at him. Thais continued sketching. Lukas picked his nose. Zeno vibrated in place, his hooves scraping against the stone.

"Now," Cornelius said.

Nobody moved.

"I said," Cornelius repeated, his voice dropping to a dangerous register, "form a line."

Zeno broke first. The satyr-kin snorted, a sound like a bellows wheezing, and reached into the pouch at his belt. He withdrew a handful of something white and doughy.

"Catch!" Zeno shouted.

The dough struck Cornelius square in the chest.

Silence fell over the circle. The dough, a sticky, yeasty mass intended for the afternoon's baking lesson, clung to Cornelius's scales. It was warm. It smelled of fermentation and rebellion.

Cornelius looked down at the affront. He looked up at Zeno. The boy was grinning, waiting for a reaction, his eyes bright with the particular madness of adolescence.

"That," Cornelius said slowly, "was a mistake."

He inhaled. His draconic heritage provided certain biological advantages, among them a breath weapon that, while not of the magnitude possessed by his distant cousins in the Capital City—those bus-sized monsters who could melt stone—was sufficient to cauterize wounds, solder metal, and intimidate unruly patrons who refused to pay overdue fines.

Cornelius opened his jaws and exhaled.

A tiny blue flame, no larger than a candle's flicker, wavered in the air before his snout. It danced for a moment, made a sound like a dying sigh, and vanished.

The silence that followed was profound.

Then Zeno laughed. It was not a mean laugh, precisely, but it was loud, and it was joined by Lukas's guffaw and even a snort from Thais, who had finally turned around.

"Nice trick, Lizard!" Zeno crowed. "Do it again!"

Cornelius stood frozen on the stone. His chest felt tight, and not from the effort of breathing fire. The humidity, he told himself. It was the humidity affecting his internal chemistry. Dragons required dry air to properly ignite their breath. This was a known fact. This was not a reflection of his stature, his age, or his increasingly diminished capacity to project authority.

He stepped down from the stone. The dough fell from his chest with a wet plop.

"I shall be in the library tent," Cornelius said. His voice was steady. Precise. "Zeph, you will supervise the... the whatever this is. Imelda, a word."

He did not run. He walked with dignity toward the canvas structure that had been erected behind the Villa, designated as the temporary library. His tail dragged slightly, stirring the dust. He did not look back.

The library tent was a disaster waiting to happen. Cornelius pushed through the flap and surveyed the interior with a despair that bordered on the existential. The shelves were wooden planks balanced on crates. The books sat in sealed wax-canvas bags, sweating in the heat. The floor was dirt.

"Unacceptable," Cornelius whispered.

He moved methodically, because method was all he had. He checked the seals on the bags. He arranged the inventory sheets in alphabetical order. He placed his spectacles case on the small camp table at exactly ninety degrees to the edge. He sat on his haunches and stared at the canvas wall.

From outside, he could hear Zeph attempting to rally the campers. The boy's voice cracked as he tried to organize a game. The children shouted over him. Someone screamed with delight. A heavy object—possibly Zeno—crashed into something hollow.

Cornelius closed his eyes. He was a Library Dragon. He was Draco bibliotheca. He had guarded the Solterra Bay collection for seventy-three years. He had faced book thieves, paper mites, and the Great Flood of '09. He could manage a group of children for two weeks.

He could.

He would.

He opened his eyes and adjusted his spectacles.

The noise outside subsided gradually as the afternoon wore on. Cornelius busied himself with cataloging the emergency reserve texts, his claws clicking against the paper with a rhythm that soothed his nerves. He marked the condition of each volume with meticulous care. He sorted the spare index cards by subject. He ignored the cramp in his wings and the persistent, gnawing sense that he was in over his head.

Evening arrived with the sound of ceramic bowls being distributed in the dining area. Cornelius emerged from his tent to supervise the meal, his composure rebuilt layer by layer like the scales on his hide. He inspected the stew for foreign objects. He ensured the bread was sliced uniformly. He sat at the head of the rough-hewn table and watched the campers eat with a vigilance that made several of them nervous.

Zeno, he noted, had been seated between Imelda and Zeph, effectively neutralized by soft power and strategic positioning. The boy ate with his hands, but at least he was not throwing anything.

Pippa sat at the far end of the table, small and quiet, her pigtails messy with twigs. She had a book propped against her water jug, and she read while she ate, her eyes flicking back and forth across the pages with an intensity that Cornelius found slightly more acceptable than the others' behavior. Fairy tales, he noted. The Brothers Grimm. Dark stuff for a child, but at least she was literate.

After the meal, the campers dispersed. Imelda organized a washing station. Zeph attempted to establish a fire pit protocol. Cornelius patrolled the perimeter, ensuring the boundaries were secure.

He found Lukas sitting alone on the steps of the Sanctuary Barn, looking bored. The boy kicked at the dirt with his heels.

"I require a task," Lukas announced.

"You require patience," Cornelius replied.

"I'm bored. Zeno won't let me help with the pranks because I'm 'too loud.' Thais won't let me see her drawings. And the new kid—Pippa—she just reads."

"Reading is a noble pursuit," Cornelius said. "You should try it."

"Books are boring," Lukas said. "Unless they have pictures of food."

Cornelius sighed, a sound like wind through dry leaves. "Return to the common area. I believe Counselor Taraki is organizing a stargazing activity."

"Yeah, yeah," Lukas said. He didn't move.

Cornelius left him there. He had more pressing concerns. The library tent required locking down for the night. He had brought a special clasp, dwarven-made, that could secure the flap against intrusion. He fitted it now, testing the mechanism three times to ensure it held.

"All secure?" Imelda asked from behind him.

"Obviously," Cornelius said. He did not turn. "The collection is safe. The humidity is... manageable. I have established order."

"Have you?" Imelda's voice carried that gentle, infuriating amusement that always made Cornelius feel as though she could see through his scales to the insecurity beneath. "The children seem energetic."

"The children are barbarians," Cornelius said. "But they are contained barbarians. Zeno is under watch. Kyria is documenting violations rather than causing them. The Miller boy is merely hungry, not malicious. And the girl... Pippa... she is harmless. She reads."

"She does," Imelda agreed. "She has been reading all afternoon. Under the big olive tree. I gave her a bag of those iridescent sprinkles Cassius sent up for the baking demonstration. She said she wanted to decorate some cookies for the other children."

Cornelius nodded. "A constructive use of time. Decorative arts require precision. She will learn discipline."

"Discipline," Imelda repeated. "Yes. I am sure she will."

Imelda walked away, her sandals making soft sounds on the tiles. Cornelius checked the lock one final time. He looked out over the camp. The Treehouse Cabins were darkening silhouettes against the sky. The Pergola stood empty, the stone press gleaming in the twilight. Everything was in its place. Everything was controlled.

He did not see Pippa in the shadows beneath the ancient olive tree, her book open on her knees, her hands cupped around a handful of cookies that glittered with an unnatural dust. He did not see her whisper to the crumbs, her voice soft and earnest, weaving a story about princes and transformations and the magic of making things special. He did not see her offer the cookies to Lukas, who had wandered over, complaining of hunger, his eyes lighting up at the sight of the sprinkles.

He did not see the boy eat.

Cornelius turned and entered the Stone Villa, satisfied that his system was intact, that the chaos was outside, and that the night would pass in dignified silence.

He locked the door behind him.
