Chapter 11

Cornelius Drake arranged the fresh ledger upon the field desk with the precision of a surgeon preparing a trepanation. The canvas walls of the library tent rippled in the dry breeze from the cooling charm, sending motes of dust dancing through the single shaft of lamplight. He placed the leather-bound book exactly parallel to the edge of the desk, its spine aligned with the tent’s central support pole.

“Progress optimal,” Cornelius muttered to the empty tent. He dipped his claw in the inkwell and inscribed the date at the top of the first page. Day Six. Below it, he wrote: *Hypothesis Revision: Narrative Contamination via Decorative Vector.*

Maya shifted in her ventilated box atop the reference shelf. The box turtle extended her neck, peered at Cornelius with one dark eye, then withdrew into her shell with a soft *thunk*. Cornelius adjusted his spectacles. He had provided fresh lettuce and a shallow dish of water. The turtle was secure. The library was organized. The dwarven lock on the tent flap remained engaged.

He had sixty-two hours to reverse three transformations before the parents arrived. He had a new ledger. He had a working theory.

What he did not have was confidence.

The tent flap snapped open. Imelda entered, her silver braids clicking with copper beads. She carried a tray bearing tea and a stack of vellum contracts. Her expression was serene, which Cornelius had learned to interpret as a warning.

“Master Orestes approaches,” Imelda said. She placed the tray upon the desk, nudging the inkwell one inch to the left to make room. “He brings the finalized contracts for the Solterra Bay Inter-Municipal Youth Culinary Showcase. The Bake-Off.”

Cornelius’s scales prickled. “He is early.”

“He is punctual,” Imelda corrected. “You are nervous. Adjust your spectacles, Cornelius. They are crooked.”

Cornelius pushed his spectacles up his snout. “I am not nervous. I am... preparing. Orestes possesses Truth-Sense. If I speak a falsehood, he will sneeze. Violently. The contracts will be covered in sphinx mucus, and we will lose the venue, the funding, and our reputations.”

“Then speak truth,” Imelda said.

“I intend to,” Cornelius said. He looked at the turtle. He looked at the tent flap. “But the truth is... complex. The camp currently houses one turtle, one pigeon, one donkey, and a quantity of narrative magic that defies cataloging. Orestes will not find this acceptable.”

Imelda poured tea. The steam rose in a straight column. “Speak carefully. He arrives in three minutes.”

Cornelius straightened his waistcoat. He checked his claws for ink stains. He reviewed his mental index of permissible statements. *The campers are present.* True. *The curriculum proceeds.* Arguably true, if one interpreted 'proceeds' broadly. *Zeno is committed to his role.* Technically accurate, if the role was 'donkey.'

The tent flap swept aside.

Master Orestes ducked through the entrance, his wings—feathered and tawny—folding tight against his shoulders to clear the canvas. He stood nearly seven feet tall, a Sphinx-kin with the body of a lion and the head of a scholarly human, his beard braided with gold wire and his eyes the color of polished amber. He wore a linen robe of impeccable white, unstained by dust or dough. In his hand, he carried a scroll case of carved ebony.

“Drake,” Orestes said. His voice resonated like a bell in a stone tower. “Kassiani. I trust the camp thrives?”

Cornelius stood rigid. “The camp operates within expected parameters.”

*Achoo!*

Orestes sneezed. A small cloud of gold dust erupted from his nostrils. He produced a handkerchief and dabbed his nose. “Excuse me. The pollen count is high this season.”

Cornelius froze. Had that been a reaction to a lie? Or merely seasonal allergies? He had not mentioned the pollen count.

“You look distressed, Drake,” Orestes said. He settled onto the camp stool, which creaked alarmingly under his weight. “I require only your signature on the participation agreement. The Showcase is set for Sunday. Forty-eight hours hence. The Mayor demands a spectacle. I demand compliance.”

“Sunday,” Cornelius repeated. His internal chronometer recalibrated. Not sixty-two hours. Forty-eight. “That is... ambitious.”

“Is that a problem?” Orestes asked. His amber eyes narrowed.

Cornelius chose his words with the care of a man defusing a bomb. “The camp has embraced... immersive pedagogy. The students are currently engaged in deep, transformative exercises. Role-playing scenarios. Method acting. They are... inhabiting their assignments.”

*Achoo!*

Orestes sneezed again, louder. The force of it ruffled the pages of Cornelius’s new ledger. “My apologies. The dust.” He looked at the tent walls, at the stone floor, at Maya’s box. “You keep a terrarium?”

“A specimen,” Cornelius said quickly. “For biological study. The campers are learning... metamorphosis. Life cycles. The journey from human to... other states... and back again.”

Orestes’s eyes gleamed. “An educational menagerie?”

“Precisely,” Cornelius said. He felt sweat forming under his scales. “We have a pigeon. For ornithology. And a donkey. For... beast of burden studies. Agricultural appreciation. The Donkey Prince fable. Very relevant to culinary history. Grain transportation.”

Orestes studied him. Cornelius held his breath. If the sphinx sneezed again, the contracts would be void. The camp would lose the Showcase. The Council would arrive to find not a functioning educational facility but a barnyard.

“You have always been... eccentric, Drake,” Orestes said. He unrolled the contract. The vellum was heavy, embossed with the seal of Solterra Bay. “The terms are standard. Five teams. Three dishes each. Judging at noon on Sunday. The winner receives the Golden Whisk and a grant extension. The losers receive... sympathy.”

Cornelius took the quill. “We will participate.”

“With human children, I presume,” Orestes said. “Not actual donkeys.”

“The participants will be... restored to their primary forms by Sunday,” Cornelius said. This was true. It had to be true. He would make it true. “They are merely... rehearsing. Method acting. Deep immersion.”

Orestes leaned forward. His nose twitched. “Drake. Is there anything occurring at this camp that violates Council safety statutes?”

Cornelius’s mind raced. He thought of Lukas in the dovecote, eating floating bread. He thought of Maya in her box. He thought of Zeno in Zeph’s room, wearing a tunic stretched over donkey shoulders.

“The camp has experienced no violations of the permitted curriculum,” Cornelius said. Each word was a stone placed upon a bridge. “All magical instruction has remained within Council-approved parameters. Any... additional transformations... have been extracurricular. Student-led. Experimental theater.”

Orestes stared. The silence stretched. Cornelius could hear his own heartbeat, a rapid ticking like a metronome set to *allegro agitato*.

“Very well,” Orestes said. He did not sneeze. “Sign.”

Cornelius signed. His claw scratched against the vellum, leaving a trail of black ink that looked like a crack in the world. Imelda signed below him, her handwriting flowing and elegant.

Orestes rolled the contract and placed it in his case. “Sunday. Noon. Do not be late. Do not be... transformed.” He stood, his wings brushing the tent ceiling. “And Drake? Dust your library. The particulate density is triggering my sinuses.”

He ducked out through the flap. His footsteps faded across the gravel path.

Cornelius collapsed onto his stool. His wings drooped until the tips touched the stone floor. His tail uncurled and lay limp. “He did not sneeze,” Cornelius whispered. “I spoke technical truths. He did not sneeze.”

“You performed admirably,” Imelda said. She picked up the tea tray. “Forty-eight hours. Sunday. The parents arrive Saturday evening. The Showcase is Sunday. We have a deadline.”

“We have a catastrophe,” Cornelius said. He looked at Maya’s box. “We have three transformed campers and a contractual obligation to produce five teams of functional human children capable of baking competitively.”

“We have a framework,” Imelda corrected. “Now you must solve the narrative. Find Pippa. Find the source of the dust. Reverse the transformations.”

Cornelius straightened. He reached for his ledger. “I shall begin by interviewing Pippa. Gently. Without alarming her. I shall treat her as a witness, not a suspect. I shall—”

The tent flap burst open. Zeph stumbled inside, his hair standing in wild peaks, his tunic covered in straw. His eyes were wide, white-rimmed, and panicked.

“Boss,” Zeph gasped. He bent double, hands on knees, catching his breath. “It’s Zeno. It’s bad.”

Cornelius stood, knocking over the inkwell. Black ink spread across the ledger in a blooming stain. “What has occurred? Has he injured himself? Has he been discovered?”

“He’s eating hay,” Zeph said. “From the floor. And he... he tried to bray at me. But it wasn’t words. It was just... noise. Boss, he’s forgetting. He’s forgetting he’s human.”

The tent seemed to shrink. The air grew thin. Cornelius felt his scales go flat against his body, a sensation like ice water poured down his spine.

“The transformation is deepening,” Cornelius whispered. “The Donkey Prince archetype is overwriting his human cognition. The narrative is consuming him.”

“We have to fix him,” Zeph said. His voice cracked. “I can’t... I can’t watch him forget his own name. He knew it yesterday. He reacted to it. Now he just looks at me with those big eyes, and there’s nothing... nothing human behind them.”

Imelda set down the tray. Her face was grave. “How long?”

“Hours,” Zeph said. “Maybe less. He’s changing. Getting more... donkey. The blue mane is spreading. It’s not just hair anymore. It’s fur.”

Cornelius looked at his ledger, now ruined with ink. He looked at the tent flap, beyond which lay the chaotic camp, the hidden children, the approaching deadline. Forty-eight hours. Less, perhaps, for Zeno.

“Then we have no time for gentle interviews,” Cornelius said. His voice hardened. His claws extended. “We must find Pippa. We must identify the source of the iridescent dust. And we must construct a reversal narrative immediately. Before Zeno is lost entirely to the fable.”

He marched toward the flap, then stopped. He turned back to the desk. He picked up the ruined ledger, the pages stuck together with ink.

“I shall require,” Cornelius said, “another new ledger.”

Zeph let out a sound that was almost a laugh, almost a sob. “Boss, we’re going to need more than a ledger. We’re going to need a miracle.”

“Then we shall manufacture one,” Cornelius said. He pushed his spectacles up his snout. “Step aside, Zeph. We have a donkey to save.”

He swept out of the tent, his tail lashing, his wings half-furled for action. Behind him, Maya the turtle withdrew completely into her shell, and the ink continued to spread across the stone, dark and irreversible.
