Chapter 18

Cornelius Drake entered the Pergola with his claws clicking against the terracotta tiles in a rhythm of calculated precision. The morning heat had already begun to radiate from the clay beehive ovens, pressing against his scales like a damp cloth. He adjusted his spectacles, scanning the kitchen with the methodical intensity of a librarian searching for a misplaced folio.

The Final Feast cake dominated the olive press slab. It stood three tiers high, a monumental construction of sponge and sugar that cast a shadow sharp enough to serve as a bookmark. Crystallized violets caught the ambient light, and twelve spun-sugar swans perched atop the upper tier, their wings spread in attitudes of imminent departure. The cake smelled of vanilla and butter and, beneath that, the faint metallic tang of narrative potential—like copper wires warming in the sun.

Cassius stood beside it, his hands dusted with flour, his horns wrapped in protective gauze against the heat. He looked up as Cornelius approached, his expression frayed at the edges.

“She is behind the fermentation vats,” Cassius whispered, gesturing with a wooden spoon toward the back of the Pergola. “Reading. She would not let me see the book, but she has been crying. Softly. Like a leaky tap.”

Cornelius felt his tail twitch. He had instructed Pippa not to read. He had given her the pen—his brass pen, symbol of his authority as a cataloger—to write a new ending, not to retreat further into the narrative that threatened to launch them all into the lunar void. Yet here she was, violating the directive, immersed in the very text that had transformed her brother into a pigeon and her friends into beasts of burden.

He moved past the workbench, navigating around sacks of flour and ceramic bowls. The stone press slab radiated a solid, ancient coolness against his flank as he passed. Behind the row of wooden fermentation vats—tall cylinders smelling of yeast and honey—he found her.

Pippa sat on a low stool, her knees drawn up to her chin, the gold-edged storybook open in her lap. She wore a pinafore dress with pockets that bulged suspiciously—likely containing the glass vials of iridescent narrative dust. Her pigtails had come loose, strands of hair sticking to her damp cheeks. She did not look up as Cornelius approached, but her shoulders stiffened.

“Pippa,” Cornelius said. He kept his voice low, attempting to modulate the natural haughtiness of his tone into something resembling gentleness. It felt like trying to shelve a book while wearing mittens. “We must speak regarding the manuscript.”

Pippa turned a page. The paper made a sound like a sigh. “I’m reading the ending,” she said. Her voice was small but carried a stubborn weight. “The Baker bakes the swans into the cake. The King eats it. Everyone flies away to be safe. It’s a happy ending, Mr. Drake. No one gets hurt on the moon. There’s no gravity there. No falling.”

Cornelius stepped closer. The stone tiles were cool against his claws. “It is not safety, Pippa. It is annihilation. The moon has no air. No libraries. It is a form of shelving—permanent and absolute.”

He reached into his waistcoat pocket and withdrew the brass pen—he had retrieved it from her earlier that morning, or perhaps she had returned it; the details blurred in his exhaustion, but the weight of it in his claw was reassuring. He held it out, the metal gleaming dully in the kitchen light.

“You are a Bard of the Old Line,” he said. “Your grandmother sang wheat into flour. You possess the ability to impress reality with narrative. But you must edit the story, not merely read it. You must write an ending where the kingdom remains grounded.”

Pippa looked up then. Her eyes were red-rimmed, the lashes clumped with tears she had not yet shed. “I don’t want to be special,” she said. “I just wanted Lukas to be happy. And Zeno to be strong. And Maya to feel safe. The book said... the book said if I made them into the story, they would be protected. The Prince flies away from danger. The Knight carries all the burdens so others don’t have to. The Lady sleeps where nothing can touch her.”

Cornelius felt a prickling sensation along his spine. He crouched down, bringing himself to her eye level—a position that strained his dignity but seemed necessary. The stone floor pressed against his haunches.

“Lukas is not happy,” Cornelius said. He kept his voice steady, factual, though his heart was racing. “He is a pigeon, Pippa. He roosts in the rafters. He cannot read. He cannot hug his mother. Zeno is a donkey, braying in the root cellar, forgetting his own name. Maya is a turtle, withdrawn so deeply into her shell that she may never emerge. You have not protected them. You have encoded them.”

Pippa’s lower lip trembled. “But the story...”

“The story is wrong,” Cornelius said. He tapped the brass pen against his own claw for emphasis. “It proposes that safety lies in escape, in transformation, in flight. But Camp Olea is not a place for escape. It is a place for education. For grounding. You must change the ending.”

Pippa clutched the book to her chest. The gold edges of the pages seemed to shimmer, reflecting the heat from the ovens. “I don’t know how,” she whispered. “Every time I try to write something different, the words slide off the page. The story wants what it wants. It’s too loud.”

Cornelius reached out, intending to place a comforting claw upon her shoulder—a gesture he had observed Imelda perform with great success. But before he could touch her, Pippa looked past him, toward the rafters of the Pergola.

“Lukas?” she said.

Cornelius turned. There, perched upon the central beam above the olive press slab, was a pigeon. He wore a blue bandana around his neck—the “blue scarf” of the Prince in the story. Lukas cooed softly, his head bobbing as he observed the scene below.

“See?” Cornelius said, seizing upon the evidence. “He is trapped, Pippa. Trapped in the narrative you imposed. If you complete the story during the feast, if you read the ending while the cake is served, this—” he gestured to encompass the kitchen, the camp, the very ground beneath them, “—all of this will lift into the sky. We will fly to the moon, just as the swans did. We will suffocate in the vacuum of space.”

Pippa stared at the pigeon. Her brother. The blue bandana was a bright, mocking spot of color against the wooden beams.

“I didn’t know,” she said. Her voice cracked. “I thought... I thought I was making them special. Like Grandmother’s singing. I thought if I could just get the story right, everything would be pretty and safe. But I broke them. I broke Lukas.”

The tears began to flow in earnest now, sliding down her cheeks and splashing onto the open pages of the book. The paper darkened where the drops fell, absorbing the moisture with a thirsty rustle.

Cornelius felt a sudden drop in air pressure. His ears popped. The temperature in the kitchen seemed to plummet despite the ovens. He looked down at Pippa’s pockets. Through the fabric of her pinafore, a light was shining—a violent, pulsing red that filtered through the cotton like a warning lantern.

“Pippa,” Cornelius said, his voice rising despite his intentions. “Control your breathing. You are destabilizing the narrative field.”

“I can’t,” Pippa sobbed. She hugged the book tighter, rocking back and forth on the stool. “I can’t fix it. I’m not a Bard. I’m just a girl who wanted her brother to stop being sad about cookies. I wanted to be special like Grandmother, but I’m not. I’m just broken.”

The red glow intensified. Cornelius could see it now—the vials in her pockets were glowing crimson, the iridescent dust shifting from violet-green to arterial red. The scent in the air changed. The warm smell of yeast and sugar was overwhelmed by the sharp, metallic odor of ozone and ancient paper—sea salt and vellum, but corrupted now, tinged with fear.

The cake on the slab began to vibrate. The spun-sugar swans trembled, their crystalline wings chattering against each other like teeth.

Cassius shouted from across the kitchen. “Cornelius! The dough! It’s reacting!”

Cornelius looked toward the workbench. The new batch of bread dough Cassius had been kneading was rising visibly, bubbling up over the sides of the bowl in a chaotic, uncontrolled surge. The yeast had gone feral again, responding to Pippa’s emotional state.

“Pippa, listen to me,” Cornelius said. He reached for her hands, trying to pry the book from her grip. “You are not broken. You are untrained. But you must stop reading. You must let go of the narrative.”

“I can’t!” Pippa wailed.

The air pressure dropped further. Cornelius’s spectacles slid down his snout. He felt lightheaded, as if he were already ascending. The red light from Pippa’s pockets was blinding now, illuminating the stone tiles in a bloody wash.

He had pushed too hard. He had been the Bad Cop—the rigid authority figure demanding logic from a child who operated on emotion. He had broken her with facts when she needed comfort. And now the magic was turning, twisting from protective narrative into explosive, fear-driven chaos.

“Imelda,” Cornelius called out, though he knew she was not in the Pergola. “Imelda, I require assistance!”

The book in Pippa’s hands began to smoke. The pages curled at the edges, not from fire, but from raw, unchanneled magical potential. The gold edges flaked away, drifting upward in the thinning air like ash.

Cornelius grabbed Pippa’s shoulders. “Pippa, look at me. You are special. You are extraordinarily special. But you must not finish this story. Please. Put the book down.”

Pippa looked up at him, her face streaked with tears, her eyes wide and uncomprehending. The red light pulsed in rhythm with her heartbeat.

“I’m sorry,” she whispered.

Then the kitchen door slammed open.

Mrs. Miller stood in the doorway, holding a ceramic coffee mug in one hand. She wore her linen dress, the color of unbleached parchment, and her expression was one of mild confusion, shifting rapidly to alarm as she took in the scene: her daughter glowing red, surrounded by vibrating sugar swans and levitating flour; the small dragon clutching her shoulders; the air thick with the scent of burning paper and magic.

“Pippa?” Mrs. Miller said.

Pippa turned. “Mommy?”

The coffee mug slipped from Mrs. Miller’s fingers. It fell in slow motion, turning end over end, the dark liquid spilling out in a suspended arc. The mug struck the terracotta tiles and shattered with a sound like a gunshot, the ceramic shards skittering across the stone.

The sound broke the spell.

Pippa gasped. The red light in her pockets winked out. The book fell from her lap, thudding against the stone floor. The cake stopped vibrating. The dough in the bowl collapsed with a wet sigh.

Mrs. Miller stood frozen, staring at her daughter, at the chaos, at the pigeon in the rafters with the blue bandana.

“What,” she said, her voice barely audible, “is happening to my daughter?”

Cornelius released Pippa’s shoulders. He stepped back, his claws clicking against the tiles. He adjusted his spectacles, though his hands were shaking.

“Mrs. Miller,” he said, his voice returning to its formal register, though pitched slightly higher than usual. “Your daughter is manifesting a suppressed Bardic-Dryad hybrid lineage. She has accidentally transformed three campers into animals via narrative inscription. And unless we teach her to edit her own story within the next three hours, we are all going to fly to the moon and die.”

Mrs. Miller looked at the broken mug at her feet. Then she looked at Pippa, who was crying quietly now, small hiccuping sobs that shook her narrow shoulders.

Mrs. Miller stepped over the shards of ceramic. She walked to her daughter. She knelt down, her linen dress pooling on the stone floor, and she wrapped her arms around Pippa.

“Hush,” Mrs. Miller said. “Hush, baby. Mommy’s here. We’ll fix it.”

She looked up at Cornelius over the top of Pippa’s head. Her eyes were not angry. They were terrified, but they were also sharp, focused, and suddenly, fiercely protective.

“Tell me what to do,” Mrs. Miller said. “Tell me how to help her.”

Cornelius felt his tail relax, unkinking from the tight coil it had formed. The air pressure normalized. The scent of coffee mixed with the lingering trace of ozone, creating a strange but grounding aroma.

“You must sing,” Cornelius said. “As your mother sang to the wheat. You must provide the harmonic counterpoint to her narrative. Family is the stabilizer, Mrs. Miller. The story has been too loud because she has been trying to sing alone.”

Mrs. Miller nodded. She began to hum, a low, tuneless sound at first, then strengthening into something resonant and warm. Pippa buried her face in her mother’s shoulder, her sobs gradually quieting.

The brass pen in Cornelius’s claw felt warm. He looked at the cake, at the waiting swans, at the pigeon Lukas who had settled onto the slab, watching his mother and sister with a bead-bright eye.

They had three hours. And now, at last, they had a team.
