Chapter 14

Cornelius Drake found Cassius in the Pergola, standing motionless at the old olive press slab, his hands buried wrist-deep in dough that had long past the point of kneading. The satyr-kin’s shoulders shook. Flour dusted his beard, his horns, and the front of his apron, but the white patches were darkening where tears mixed with the fine powder, creating a paste of grief upon his cheeks.

The dough itself was wrong. Cornelius could see it from the entrance. It sagged rather than stretched, sweating a faint, anxious sheen of oil where it should have held a taut skin. The scent was not of yeast blooming in contentment, but of sharp, metallic panic—the same smell that had preceded the migrating sourdough avalanche three days prior.

Cassius did not look up. His fingers trembled within the mass. “I can feel it,” he whispered. His voice cracked like dried parchment. “The fear. It is inside me, and it is going into the dough. It will go feral. It will climb the walls again. I cannot stop it.”

Cornelius’s tail twitched once against the terracotta tiles. His first instinct was to catalog the failure, to note the viscosity of the dough and the tremor in the baker’s hands, to prescribe a solution involving temperature control and standardized hydration ratios. But the sight of Cassius—usually so warm, so solid—weeping into his craft stopped the words in Cornelius’s throat.

He stepped forward. His claws clicked against the stone. He reached up—he had to reach, for Cassius was tall even when hunched—and placed one bronze-scaled paw upon the satyr’s shoulder. The contact felt strange. Unpracticed. But necessary.

“Listen to me,” Cornelius said. He did not remove his claw. “You are not the source of the chaos. You are the anchor. The dough responds to your hands, yes, but we shall ensure those hands are steady.”

“I cannot bake if I am afraid,” Cassius said. A tear fell into the dough. “And I am afraid. The parents are here. The Showcase is tomorrow. If I fail—if the bread betrays us again—”

“Then you shall bake, and I shall lie,” Cornelius said. The declaration emerged with a certainty that surprised even him. “You focus upon the chemistry of flour and water. You focus upon the fermentation, the oven spring, the crust. You give me the bread. I shall give the parents the narrative. I shall tell them it is artisanal. I shall tell them it is deconstructed. I shall construct a framework of such elaborate pedagogical theory that they will believe the bread is meant to behave exactly as it does.”

Cassius turned his head. His eyes were red-rimmed, wet. “You would do that? You hate improvisation.”

“I hate disorder,” Cornelius corrected. “But I am learning to manage it. You bake. I shall handle the deception. We each have our craft.”

Cassius’s shoulders dropped. He exhaled, a shuddering breath that smelled of anise and yeast. His hands, still in the dough, stopped trembling. “You are a good friend, Cornelius. For a dragon who once accused my croissants of structural insufficiency.”

“They were insufficient,” Cornelius said, but his tone had softened. He removed his claw and tapped the edge of the stone slab. “Now. We require a neutralizing agent. The dough must be restarted. Discard this batch. We have time for a preferment if we begin within the hour. I shall oversee the measurements. You oversee the feeling.”

Cassius nodded. He scraped the anxious dough into the compost bin with a finality that seemed to scrape away some of his own dread. “Yes. Yes, alright. Fresh start.”

Cornelius was arranging the flour sacks in alphabetical order—rye, spelt, wheat—when Zeph arrived. The boy’s hair stood in wild peaks, and his tunic was smeared with dirt from the root cellar. He carried a hayfork over one shoulder like a soldier’s rifle, but his expression was not frightened. It was focused.

“Boss,” Zeph said. He leaned the fork against the clay oven. “We have a situation. Lukas is roosting in the Villa’s upper rafters. He keeps cooing. And Zeno… he’s digging. In the cellar. I think he’s trying to burrow through the stone wall.”

Cornelius’s scales prickled. “The Doukas parents?”

“Asleep, I think. For now. But if Lukas drops a feather on their breakfast table, or if Zeno brays again…” Zeph trailed off. He scratched his head. “We need a better cover than ‘method acting.’ They’re gonna want to see the animals up close. They’re artists. They wanna sketch ‘em.”

“What do you propose?” Cornelius asked. He folded his wings tight against his body, waiting.

Zeph straightened. He looked at Cassius, who was measuring water with careful, steady hands, then back to Cornelius. “A petting zoo,” he said. “We lean into it. We say it’s part of the curriculum. A menagerie for sensory education. The kids are learning animal husbandry through… immersive proximity. Or something.”

Cornelius tilted his head. “You wish to present the transformed campers as intentional exhibits?”

“We gotta hide ’em in plain sight,” Zeph said. His voice gained confidence. “Lukas is just a really friendly pigeon with a bandana. Zeno’s a therapy donkey. Maya’s a… a tactile sculpture for the visually impaired. We set up stations. We control the narrative. You’re the Ringmaster, Boss. You direct the parents to look where we want. And I… I’ll manage the animals. Keep ’em calm. Keep ’em fed. Keep ’em quiet.”

Cornelius studied the boy. Zeph’s hands were steady. His eyes were bloodshot, but clear. He was not the fumbling intern who had dropped the Floaty-Loaf three days ago. He was not the child who had fallen asleep on stakeout duty. He was something else. A guardian, perhaps. A keeper.

“You would be the Ringmaster,” Cornelius said quietly. “Not I.”

“Someone’s gotta handle the paperwork and the parents,” Zeph said. “You’re better at the lying. I’m better at the… the creature stuff. It’s in my blood, maybe. The lamassu thing. I can calm Zeno. I can keep Lukas from flying into the Doukas’ window. But I gotta be official. I need you to say I’m in charge of the menagerie. Give me the title. Makes it easier to boss the campers around if they think I’m not just the intern.”

Cornelius reached into his waistcoat. He withdrew his pen—a heavy, brass instrument—and held it out. “You are hereby appointed Ringmaster of the Camp Olea Educational Menagerie. You have authority over all fauna, domesticated or transformed. You report only to me. You are responsible for their safety, their silence, and their presentation. Do you accept?”

Zeph took the pen. He turned it over in his fingers, then tucked it behind his ear. “Yeah, Boss. I accept.” He almost smiled. “I’ll go check on the donkey. Make sure he doesn’t kick through the cellar wall.”

“Zeph,” Cornelius said as the boy turned to leave.

“Yeah?”

“You are doing well,” Cornelius said. The words felt formal, but he meant them. “It is commendable.”

Zeph’s ears reddened. He nodded, once, and disappeared into the dark toward the Villa.

The night settled over Camp Olea with the weight of a closed book. The Doukas parents had retired to their room in the eastern wing, their sketchbooks filled with ominous studies of olive branches and shadow. Cassius worked in the Pergola by lamplight, his hands steady now, the new dough rising in proofing baskets with placid, yeasty patience. Zeph was in the root cellar, speaking softly to Zeno, the sound of his voice a low hum against the stone.

Cornelius sat upon the Villa’s porch steps. His third ledger of the week—the one he had started after the ink spill—dug into his side, a hard rectangle of pressure against his ribs. He did not open it. He did not catalog. He simply sat, his wings drooping against the cool terracotta, his spectacles sliding down his snout. He was too tired to push them up.

The air smelled of dust and old paper. Exhaustion settled into his bones, a heaviness that felt like it might fossilize him there, turning him into a statue of a dragon upon the steps, a guardian who had failed to guard against the one thing he had not catalogued: a child’s wish for a happy ending.

A small sound disturbed the silence. The scuff of a shoe. The rustle of pages.

Pippa stood at the bottom of the steps. She wore her nightdress, and her pigtails were loose, hair framing her face like a halo of dark silk. She clutched the old, gold-edged storybook to her chest. The book seemed heavier than she was, a repository of all the narrative weight that had unmade the camp.

“Mr. Cornelius?” she whispered.

Cornelius looked at her. He did not have the energy for interrogation. He did not have the energy for suspicion. He simply looked.

“I cannot sleep,” she said. “The stories are too loud. They want to be told. And I thought… you look sad. And tired. And I thought maybe you would like a story. Instead of more… inventory.”

Cornelius stared at her. He should refuse. He should order her to bed. He should confiscate the book. He should do a hundred things that were logical and protective and controlling.

Instead, he sighed. It was a small sound, barely a breath. “Very well,” he said. “One story. But no sprinkles. No dust. Just words.”

Pippa’s eyes widened. She climbed the steps, careful not to touch him, and sat two tiles away. She placed the book between them. The pages were soft with wear, the illustrations catching the lamplight from the window: swans, bakers, ovens, feathers.

“It is called The Baker’s Dozen Swans,” Pippa said. She opened the book. The paper smelled of vanilla and burnt sugar. “It is about a baker who loves his swans too much. And how he loses them. And how he gets them back.”

Cornelius adjusted his spectacles. He rested his claws upon his knees. He was too exhausted to maintain his vigilance, too broken to insist upon order. He nodded. “Proceed,” he said. “Read.”

Pippa took a breath. She began to speak, her voice soft and steady in the darkness, weaving a tale of feathers and flour, of spells that bound and words that freed. Cornelius listened, his head drooping, his scales settling into the cool stone. He did not notice when his tail stopped twitching. He did not notice when his eyes began to close. He only listened, letting the story wash over him like a tide, carrying him toward whatever morning would bring.
