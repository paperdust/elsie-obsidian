Chapter 10

Cornelius sat upon the pantry floor, his tail wrapped tight around his feet, his wings folded into a defensive mantle. The ceramic jars upon the shelf maintained their perfect alignment—three inches from the edge, parallel to the mortar lines—but Cornelius felt no satisfaction in their order. The basket of Mood-Muffins sat beside him, several empty spaces in the grid where Zeno’s hunger had disrupted the pattern.

The satyr-kin had left a trail of violet dust and crumbs. The trail ended at the doorway, where Zeph had guided him away, one hand on the boy’s shoulder. Zeno had hiccupped again as they left, emitting a small cloud of sparkling mist that smelled of chamomile and crystallized honesty.

Footsteps approached from the Villa’s interior. The stride was measured, deliberate. Imelda appeared in the pantry entrance, her silver braids catching the lamplight. She surveyed the scene: the scattered crumbs, the empty basket, Cornelius’s posture of defeat upon the tiles.

“Zeno is secured in Zephyr’s quarters,” Imelda said. “He is experiencing mild gastric distress from the truth-compulsion substrate. Zephyr is administering mint tea and dry crackers.”

Cornelius did not look up. He adjusted his spectacles with one claw. “He consumed the evidence. Deliberately. Systematically.”

“He consumed baked goods,” Imelda said. “He is a fourteen-year-old satyr-kin. They require caloric intake equal to a small pony. You set a trap using pastries as bait. You caught a hungry child.”

“He eliminated the control sample,” Cornelius said. His voice sounded hollow against the stone walls. “The muffins contained trace particulates of the narrative contamination. He knew. He must have known.”

Imelda stepped into the pantry. She moved with the fluid grace of deep water, her copper beads clicking softly. She lowered herself to sit upon an overturned crate, bringing her eyes level with Cornelius’s. Her gaze was steady, unshakable.

“Zephyr reports that Zeno’s only concern was the taste of hay in the Sanctuary Barn,” Imelda said. “He escaped containment because he was bored and malnourished. He has been counting dust motes and freckles for twelve hours. He is not a saboteur, Cornelius. He is a bored teenager with poor impulse control.”

Cornelius’s scales prickled. The sensation began at his spine and radiated outward, each bronze plate lifting slightly from his skin. “The blue dye packet. The chromatic signature. The pattern of disruption.”

“Hair dye,” Imelda said. “For Family Day. His mother insists upon presentability.”

Cornelius went still. His tail stopped twitching. He stared at the remaining muffins in the basket. They sat in neat rows, dusted with iridescent sugar that shifted between violet and green. Decorative. Harmless. Pippa’s work.

“I observed the magical reaction,” Cornelius whispered. “The muffins glowed violet. He spoke truth. He denied sabotage. The magic compelled honesty.”

“Then believe him,” Imelda said.

Cornelius looked up. His gold eyes met Imelda’s dark ones. “If Zeno is not the vector, then the contamination is still active. The accomplice—the true saboteur—remains unidentified. And I have…” He stopped. His claws gripped the stone floor. “I have sixty-two hours until the parents arrive. Until the Council inspection. Until Lukas and Maya must be restored or explained.”

Imelda reached out. She placed one hand upon Cornelius’s shoulder, her fingers resting lightly between his scales. “Zeno will sleep in Zephyr’s room tonight. Not as punishment, but as protection. We will watch him. You will rest. Tomorrow, we reassess.”

“I do not require rest,” Cornelius said. “I require data.”

“You require sleep,” Imelda said. Her tone allowed no argument. “Zephyr has agreed to supervise. The boy is safe. The camp is secure. For now.”

Cornelius allowed himself to be guided to his feet. He climbed the stairs to the Villa’s upper library, where he had constructed a nest of archival cotton and reference texts. He curled into the hollow, his wings wrapped tight, his mind racing through the variables. The muffins. The decorative sugar. The empty vial beneath the olive tree. Zeno’s violet hiccups.

He did not sleep. He cataloged.

***

The knocking began at dawn.

Cornelius jerked awake, his claws scrabbling against the cotton batting. He had not realized he had fallen asleep. His internal chronometer reported 5:47 AM. The knocking came again, frantic, irregular. It echoed from the lower floor, followed by the sound of running feet.

Cornelius launched from his nest. He hit the stairs with his wings half-open, his spectacles askew. He navigated the stone steps by memory, his claws clicking against the terracotta tiles.

He found Zephyr in the main hall. The boy wore yesterday’s tunic, his hair standing in wild peaks. His eyes were wide, his breathing ragged. He held his hands out before him, palms up, fingers trembling.

“Boss,” Zeph said. His voice cracked. “You need to come. Now.”

“What has occurred?” Cornelius demanded. He straightened his spectacles. “Is it the dough? Has it resumed migration?”

“It’s Zeno,” Zeph said. “He’s… he’s not right.”

Cornelius felt a cold sensation in his gut. He followed Zeph through the Villa’s corridors, past the kitchen, toward the eastern wing where the staff quarters lay. Zeph’s door stood open. Inside, the room was small, stone-walled, furnished with a narrow bed and a writing desk.

Upon the bed sat a donkey.

It was a small donkey, roughly the size of a large goat, with long ears that twitched toward the sound of their entrance. Its coat was a mottled gray-brown, except for its mane. The mane had been dyed an intense, artificial blue—the precise shade of a summer sky seen through colored glass. The same shade as Zeno’s hair.

The donkey wore Zeno’s tunic. It was stretched tight across the animal’s barrel chest, the fabric straining at the seams. The donkey’s eyes were large, brown, and frantic. It brayed—a high, panicked sound that echoed off the stone walls.

Cornelius froze in the doorway. His scales prickled, then went flat against his body. His tail dropped to the floor.

“Oh,” Cornelius said. His voice was very small.

“He was fine when we went to sleep,” Zeph said. He stood beside Cornelius, his hands still trembling. “He ate some crackers. He drank the tea. He fell asleep on the floor because he said the bed was too soft. I woke up to… to this. He’s making sounds. He knows his name. He reacts when I say ‘Zeno.’ But he’s…” Zeph gestured helplessly at the donkey. “He’s a donkey.”

Cornelius entered the room. He approached the bed with slow, precise steps. The donkey—Zeno—backed against the headboard, its hooves skidding on the wool blanket. It brayed again, softer this time, a sound of confusion and fear.

Cornelius reached out. He touched the donkey’s shoulder. The fur was coarse, warm, vibrating with rapid heartbeat. Cornelius leaned closer. He sniffed, detecting the scent of chamomile, yeast, and beneath it, the distinctive sharp note of adolescent satyr-kin sweat.

“The transformation is complete,” Cornelius whispered. “Physiological. Behavioral retention intact. Memory likely preserved.”

“What do we do?” Zeph asked. “Can you fix it? Can you turn him back?”

Cornelius did not answer. He was staring at the donkey’s mouth. A crumb of muffin lingered at the corner of the animal’s lip. It was violet-green, iridescent. Decorative.

Cornelius stepped back. He looked at his own claws. He looked at the empty space on the floor where Zeno had slept. He looked at the donkey’s blue mane.

“The muffins,” Cornelius said.

“What?” Zeph asked.

“The muffins,” Cornelius repeated. His voice rose in pitch. “The rejected Mood-Muffins. The control sample. Pippa arranged them. She applied decorative sugar. She made them pretty. Safe. Orderly.”

He turned to Zeph. His gold eyes were wide, the pupils dilated. “I placed them in the pantry. I cataloged their position. I used them as bait. And when Zeno consumed them—when he ate the evidence—I believed he was destroying proof of his guilt. But he was not destroying evidence.”

Cornelius’s claws gripped his own chest, digging into the scales. “He was ingesting the trigger. The narrative contamination was in the sugar. The iridescent dust. I fed him the curse myself. I watched him eat it.”

Zeph stared. “Wait. You’re saying… the muffins turned him into a donkey?”

“The Donkey Prince,” Cornelius said. He began to pace, his tail lashing. “A fable. A common narrative archetype. The prince who eats enchanted food and transforms into a beast of burden. The transformation is triggered by consumption, not by intent. The magic follows story logic, not criminal logic. It is not about sabotage. It is about narrative inevitability.”

He stopped. He looked at Zeno—the donkey—who was now trying to chew the corner of the pillow, his ears flattened in distress.

“Zeno was never the saboteur,” Cornelius said. The words tasted like ash. “He was the next victim. And I provided the vector. I ensured the contamination reached him. I placed the enchanted food in his path. I observed his consumption. I am…” He stopped. His wings drooped. “I am complicit.”

Zeph sat down heavily on the writing desk. “So who did it? If Zeno didn’t poison the muffins, who did?”

Cornelius closed his eyes. He saw the image: Pippa, small and quiet, arranging the muffins with geometric precision. The glass vial in her pocket. The empty vial beneath the olive tree. The way she had dusted the Floaty-Loaf for Bennie. The way she had served the Sleepy-Time Squares to Maya.

“The decorative sugar,” Cornelius said. He opened his eyes. “The pretty sugar. For sweet dreams. For orderly arrangements. Pippa has been the constant. The reliable variable. She has been tidying. Arranging. Making things beautiful.”

He turned to Zeph. “She does not know. Or she knows differently. She is operating under a different logic. A fable logic. She is not malicious. She is… narrative.”

Zeno brayed loudly. It was a demand for attention, for explanation, for apples.

“We need Imelda,” Zeph said.

“We need a reversal protocol,” Cornelius said. He approached the bed again, his movements slower now, humbled. He reached out and scratched Zeno behind the ears. The donkey leaned into the touch, his eyes half-closing. “The Donkey Prince requires a specific narrative resolution. A recognition of true nature. An act of service. Or…”

“Or what?” Zeph asked.

“Or the consumption of the specific enchanted item in reverse,” Cornelius said. He looked at the crumb of violet-green sugar still clinging to Zeno’s lip. “We must find the source. The vial. The iridescent dust. We must understand what story she is telling.”

Imelda appeared in the doorway. She looked at the donkey. She looked at Cornelius’s expression. She nodded slowly.

“The Donkey Prince,” Imelda said.

“You are familiar with the fable?” Cornelius asked.

“I am familiar with children,” Imelda said. She entered the room and sat upon the edge of the bed. Zeno—blue mane and all—immediately placed his head in her lap. She stroked his ears. “He will require patience. And privacy. We cannot have his mother arriving to find him in this state.”

“Sixty-two hours,” Cornelius said. His voice was hollow. “Three transformed campers. A Council inspection. And I have been hunting the wrong prey. I accused the victim. I fed him the curse.”

“You made an error based on available data,” Imelda said. She did not look up from stroking Zeno’s ears. “Now you have better data. Adjust your hypothesis.”

Cornelius stood in the center of the room. He looked at Zeno, the donkey with blue hair. He looked at Zeph, exhausted and frightened. He looked at Imelda, steady as stone.

“I must find Pippa,” Cornelius said. “I must understand the nature of her magic. And I must do so without alarming her, without triggering further transformations, and without revealing to the Council that we have three children in animal forms.”

He straightened his spectacles. His scales settled against his body, but the prickling sensation remained—a constant reminder of his failure.

“I shall require,” Cornelius said, “a new ledger.”

Zeno brayed softly. It sounded, Cornelius realized, like agreement.
