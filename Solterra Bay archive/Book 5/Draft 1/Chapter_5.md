 Chapter 5

Cornelius Drake arranged the dessert plates upon the terracotta tiles with the precision of a general deploying reserves. The Pergola’s grapevine canopy rustled overhead, but he ignored the movement. His attention fixed upon the tray of Sleepy-Time Squares that Cassius had positioned at the center of the long table. The brownies sat in neat rows, their surfaces dusted with powdered chamomile, emitting a scent like dried apples and quiet afternoons.

“One per camper,” Cornelius announced. He adjusted his spectacles. “The chamomile concentration is calibrated for juvenile metabolisms. Exceeding the dosage may result in excessive drowsiness or involuntary napping.”

Cassius wiped his flour-dusted hands upon his apron. “They’re just brownies, Cornelius. The magic is gentle. It’s meant to help them sleep after a long day of... explosions.”

“The Sparkroot incident was not a long day ago,” Cornelius said. “It was four hours ago. The particulate hazard has barely settled.” He scanned the dining area. The campers clustered around the benches, their faces smeared with olive oil and dust. Zeno sat at the far end, his blue hair standing at angles that suggested static electricity or mischief. The satyr-kin’s eyes kept darting toward the dessert tray.

Cornelius’s scales prickled. He marked the behavior in his mental ledger. Suspicious. Predictable.

Pippa Miller approached the table. She carried a stack of napkins in her small hands, her pigtails dusted with flour, her eyes wide and earnest. She moved with the quiet deliberation of a mouse arranging nesting materials.

“Can I help, Mr. Cassius?” she asked. Her voice was soft, barely audible above the clatter of cutlery.

Cassius smiled. “Of course, little one. You can pass these out. One square per person.”

Cornelius watched her. Pippa took the serving tongs with grave seriousness. She selected a brownie, placed it upon a napkin, and moved to the first camper. Thais accepted hers with a nod, already sketching the geometric patterns of the Pergola’s support beams upon her sleeve. Vasilis took his with a sniff, checking for allergens.

Then Pippa reached Maya.

Maya sat apart from the others, her shoulders hunched, her fingers twisting the hem of her tunic. She was a thin girl, prone to starting at loud noises, who had spent dinner staring at her soup as if it might contain secrets. Cornelius had noted her anxiety in his morning observations. She required monitoring, though not intervention.

“This one’s special,” Pippa whispered. She reached into her pocket and withdrew a small glass vial. The contents shimmered with an iridescent quality, shifting between violet and green as the light caught them.

Cornelius stiffened. His claws extended, scraping against the stone table.

But Pippa merely sprinkled a tiny amount atop Maya’s brownie. “It’s pretty sugar,” she said. “For sweet dreams. Because you like sleeping.”

Maya managed a small smile. “I do like sleeping.”

“Then this will be perfect,” Pippa said. She patted Maya’s hand. “Eat it all up.”

Cornelius relaxed his posture. Decorative sugar. A child’s gesture of friendship. Pippa was helpful, obedient, quiet. She read books under trees and shared her cookies. She was not a variable. She was a constant.

He turned his gaze back to Zeno.

The satyr-kin had risen from his bench. He circled the dessert tray, his hooves clicking against the tiles in a rhythm that set Cornelius’s teeth on edge. Zeno reached for a brownie, paused, reached again. His fingers hovered near the plate.

“Zeno,” Cornelius called. “You have already received your allotment.”

“I’m just looking,” Zeno said. His grin displayed too many teeth. “Admiring the craftsmanship. The chamomile distribution looks uneven. Some squares have more dust than others.”

“Return to your seat,” Cornelius commanded. “The perimeter check begins in twenty minutes. You will need to be in your cabin before the locks engage.”

Zeno saluted with two fingers, then retreated. But his eyes remained fixed upon the remaining brownies, and Cornelius filed the observation under *Probable Intent to Pilfer*.

The dinner concluded without incident. The campers consumed their Sleepy-Time Squares. Maya ate hers slowly, savoring the iridescent sugar, her shoulders dropping from their tense position. The chamomile worked its gentle magic. Yawns spread through the group like a contagion. Even Thais closed her sketchbook.

“Bedtime,” Imelda announced. She stood at the Villa’s doorway, her silver braids catching the lamplight. “Single file to the cabins. No dawdling.”

Cornelius supervised the exodus. He counted heads as they crossed the rope bridges to the treehouse cabins. Zeno went first, bounding up the ladder with excessive energy. Thais followed, methodical and slow. Pippa walked with Maya, holding the anxious girl’s hand, guiding her across the swaying bridge with the patience of a shepherd.

“Seventeen accounted for,” Cornelius told Imelda. “Minus Lukas.”

Imelda’s eyes met his. She knew. Of course she knew. The dovecote in the Sanctuary Barn held their secret, and Zeph stood guard there now, feeding floating breadcrumbs to a boy who had forgotten he was human.

“Seventeen visible,” Imelda corrected softly. “That is sufficient for the roll call.”

Cornelius nodded. He performed his perimeter check with ritual precision. He tested the locks on the Villa’s doors. He secured the library tent with the dwarven-made lock, checking the seal twice. He verified that the kitchen Pergola’s alchemical stores were secured behind the high shelf’s iron grate.

Order. Control. Safety.

He climbed to the Girls’ Dorm last. The treehouse cabin hung suspended between two ancient olive trees, its triangular walls constructed of cedar planks and good intentions. Cornelius knocked upon the doorframe with his claw.

“Lights out in five minutes,” he announced. “No reading after curfew. The oil lamps pose a fire hazard, and the wicks I provided are calibrated for exactly forty-five minutes of burn time.”

“Yes, Cornelius,” came the chorus of tired voices.

He peered inside. The girls had settled into their sleeping bags. Pippa was already burrowed into her nest of blankets, a book of fairy tales propped against her knees. Maya lay nearby, her eyes closed, her breathing deep and even. The chamomile had taken hold.

“Sleep well,” Cornelius said. He pulled the door shut and secured the latch. He descended the rope ladder, his claws finding each rung with practiced precision.

The camp was secure. The variables were contained.

He slept in the Villa’s library wing, upon a cushion of velvet that protected his scales from the stone floor. His internal chronometer woke him at 2:13 AM, the exact minute he had predetermined for a random security sweep.

Silence.

Then, screaming.

The sound tore through the night, high and terrified, coming from the direction of the treehouses. Cornelius leaped from his cushion, his wings snapping open for balance. He seized his spectacles in one claw and his emergency kit in the other. He burst through the Villa’s door and raced across the camp grounds.

The rope bridge to the Girls’ Dorm swayed violently. Cornelius scrambled up, his claws digging into the cedar planks. He shoved open the cabin door.

Chaos.

The girls huddled against the far wall, wrapped in blankets, pointing at Maya’s sleeping bag. The bag lay empty, deflated, the pillowcase bulging with an unnatural lump.

“What is the meaning of this?” Cornelius demanded.

“Maya’s gone!” Thais shouted. She was the only one maintaining composure, though her pencil trembled. “She was there. Then she wasn’t. Then the pillow moved.”

Cornelius approached the bed. He gripped the pillowcase with his claws and pulled it back.

A box turtle stared up at him.

It was a small creature, perhaps six inches in length, with a domed carapace patterned in amber and brown. It had retreated entirely into its shell, only its eyes visible, blinking slowly in the lamplight. Beside the turtle, crumbs of brownie littered the sheets. The plate that had held Maya’s Sleepy-Time Square sat empty upon the floor.

Cornelius’s breath stopped. His scales went cold.

Another transformation. Not a bird this time. A reptile. Hibernation. The chamomile, intended for rest, had triggered a narrative of deep sleep, of retreat, of hiding within a shell.

He spun toward the door. “Nobody leaves this cabin. Imelda! Sound the alarm!”

But as he turned, he saw a shadow in the hallway outside. A figure lurked upon the rope bridge, crouched low, trying to descend without being seen. Blue hair. Hooves. Zeno.

Cornelius roared. It was not a large sound—his flame remained feeble, his voice more indignant than terrifying—but it carried the weight of his authority. “Halt!”

Zeno froze. His eyes went wide. “I didn’t do it! I swear on the Muses!”

Cornelius lunged. He seized the satyr-kin by the wrist, his claws pressing against the pulse point. “You were near the dessert tray. You lingered. You have a history of tampering with baked goods. You added Sparkroot to the bread. You threw dough at my chest in Chapter One.”

“That was a different dough!” Zeno struggled. “I was just checking the ropes! I heard the scream! I was coming to help!”

“You were fleeing the scene,” Cornelius said. He pulled Zeno into the cabin, forcing him to his knees. “You are under camp arrest. I have caught you. The evidence is circumstantial but compelling. Your proximity to the brownies. Your disregard for permits. Your chaotic nature.”

The girls stared. Pippa sat up in her sleeping bag, her eyes round with fear or something else. “Mr. Cornelius?” she whispered. “Is Maya okay?”

Cornelius looked at the turtle. It had tucked its head completely into its shell. Stable. Alive. But transformed.

“She is... resting,” Cornelius said. He turned back to Zeno. “You will be confined to the Sanctuary Barn. You will be shackled if necessary. You will—”

“Cornelius.” Imelda’s voice cut through the panic. She stood in the doorway, her robe wrapped tight, her expression calm. “A word.”

He released Zeno’s wrist. “This is the culprit. I have solved it. The pattern matches. Zeno tampered with the brownies as he tampered with the flour. He has transformed Maya into a tortoise.”

“Turtle,” Thais corrected automatically. “Box turtle. Terrapene carolina. Note the hinged plastron.”

“Silence,” Cornelius said. He turned to Imelda. “I require chains. Or at least very strong rope.”

Imelda stepped into the cabin. She looked at Zeno, who was trembling upon his knees. She looked at the turtle on the pillow. She looked at Pippa, who clutched her book to her chest, her face a mask of innocent concern.

“Zeno,” Imelda said. “You have shown remarkable initiative tonight.”

Zeno blinked. “I have?”

“Yes. You were conducting a security sweep of the rope bridges. You detected the disturbance and responded immediately. This demonstrates a maturity we had not previously observed.”

Cornelius stared. “Imelda, he was lurking.”

“He was patrolling,” Imelda said firmly. “Therefore, I am promoting him to Special Night Watch. He will spend the remainder of the night in the Sanctuary Barn, guarding the perimeter, ensuring no further incidents occur. It is an honor, Zeno. Do you accept?”

Zeno’s expression shifted from terror to confusion to delight. “An honor? Like, a medal?”

“A responsibility,” Imelda said. “You will remain in the barn until dawn. You will not leave. You will watch over... the supplies.”

She meant Lukas. Cornelius understood. She was moving Zeno to the barn not as a prisoner, but as a guard. A double bluff.

Cornelius’s scales settled. “Yes,” he said slowly. “Special Night Watch. You will report to Zeph. You will assist him in... inventory management.”

Zeno leaped to his feet. “I accept! I’ll be the best guard ever. I’ll count the hay bales. I’ll watch the dust motes. No one will sneak past me!”

“See that they do not,” Cornelius said. He pointed toward the door. “Go. Now. Do not stop until you reach the barn loft.”

Zeno bolted, his hooves thundering down the rope bridge. Cornelius listened until the sound faded toward the Sanctuary Barn. He had contained the threat. He had identified the saboteur. The pattern fit. Zeno’s history of culinary tampering, his presence near the brownies, his attempt to flee.

He turned back to the cabin. The girls were settling, reassured by the appearance of order. Cornelius approached Pippa’s sleeping bag. She looked up at him, her eyes wide and trusting.

“Is Zeno in trouble?” she asked.

“Zeno is under supervision,” Cornelius said. “He will not harm anyone else tonight.”

“Okay,” Pippa said. She yawned. “I’m glad Maya is sleeping. She really likes sleeping.”

Cornelius looked at the turtle. It had not moved. The chamomile magic held it in deep torpor, a living metaphor for rest. He would need to research reversal protocols. He would need to consult his texts on narrative transmutation. But for now, the camp was secure.

He tucked the blanket around Pippa’s shoulders. “Go to sleep,” he said. “You are safe. The culprit is caught. The doors are locked.”

“Goodnight, Mr. Cornelius,” Pippa whispered. She closed her eyes, her face peaceful.

Cornelius extinguished the lamp. He carried the turtle—Maya—carefully in his claws, placing her in a ventilated box lined with straw. He would keep her in the library tent, near the reference volumes on herpetology. He would restore her. Just as he would restore Lukas. Just as he had restored manuscripts.

He locked the Girls’ Dorm door behind him. He checked the latch twice. The camp was quiet. The stars above the Pergola were bright. The humidity was low, favorable for parchment preservation.

As he walked back to the Villa, he passed the olive tree where Pippa had sat on the first day, whispering stories over her cookies. The memory flickered, then faded. Irrelevant. She was tucked in. She was safe.

He entered the Villa, locked the door, and slept the sleep of the righteous.

Outside, under the olive tree, a small glass vial lay empty, glinting with iridescent residue. The wind blew, and the camp was silent.
