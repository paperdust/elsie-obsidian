Chapter 4

Cornelius Drake perched upon the stone press with his tail wrapped twice around his claws for stability. The Pergola hummed with a frequency he found almost tolerable—a low, steady thrum of yellow magic, predictable as a metronome. The Floaty-Loaf demonstration had begun precisely at fourteen-hundred hours, and for seventeen blessed minutes, nothing had exploded.

He adjusted his spectacles. The lenses magnified the scene before him: a row of proofing baskets upon the central table, each containing a raw baguette that shimmered with a faint, stable aura. Council-approved levitation enchantment. Maximum altitude: four feet. Duration: ninety minutes. The permits lay folded in his vest pocket, a comforting weight against his scales.

"Gentle folding," Cassius instructed. The satyr-kin's hooves clicked against the terracotta tiles. "The yeast provides the structure. The enchantment provides the lift. You must not confuse the two."

Thais Doukas worked with mechanical precision. She folded her dough in thirds, her fingers dusted with flour, her sketchbook propped open beside her basket. She was drawing the gluten strands, Cornelius noted, treating the biological process as an architectural diagram. Her baguette, when placed upon the baking stone, rose with dignified slowness. It drifted upward exactly three feet, stabilized, and rotated once—a perfect, gentle hover. The magical resonance pulsed steady yellow, consistent, compliant.

"Acceptable," Cornelius said.

Zeno snorted. "Mine's gonna hit the clouds."

"It will not," Cornelius said. "The permit specifies—"

"Permits are suggestions," Zeno said. He had added something to his dough. Cornelius could see the excess powder glittering on the satyr-kin's claws—not standard yeast, but a crystalline substance from the high-shelf alchemical stores. Sparkroot, likely. Highly reactive. Forbidden in unlicensed quantities.

"Zeno," Cornelius warned.

"Watch this!" Zeno slammed his hands together over his loaf. The dough compressed, then expanded with a sound like a cork exiting a bottle. It did not drift. It launched.

The baguette rocketed upward, trailing flour like contrails. It struck the grapevine canopy, burst through a gap in the leaves, and continued into the open air above the Pergola. Campers screamed—some in alarm, mostly in delight. The loaf reached an altitude of approximately forty feet, paused, and began to descend in a slow, majestic spiral.

"Out of control," Cornelius said. He leaped from the press stone, his wings snapping open for balance. "Zeph! Retrieve that projectile!"

Zephyr Taraki stood at the edge of the demonstration area, his metallic bronze hair catching the light. He held a canvas sack meant for harvested bread. His eyes tracked the descending loaf. "On it, Boss."

The boy moved. He calculated the trajectory with a competence Cornelius had not previously observed, positioning himself beneath the spiral. The baguette drifted lower, rotating slowly. Zeph reached up. The loaf bobbed, caught a thermal from the ovens, and bounced off his fingertips. It drifted sideways, toward the tree line.

Zeph lunged. The campers cheered. The loaf dipped, rose again, and evaded his grasp by mere inches. It was not supposed to behave this way—Sparkroot introduced chaotic variables, turning gentle levitation into capricious flight. The yellow aura had shifted to an anxious orange at the edges.

"Containment!" Cornelius commanded.

"I’m trying!" Zeph jumped, swatted, and missed. The baguette floated higher, taunting him. The campers laughed. Zeno danced in circles, bleating with triumph.

Thais watched with clinical interest, her pencil moving. "The aerodynamics are fascinating. The center of gravity is shifting."

"I will retrieve it," Cornelius said. He spread his wings. A house-cat-sized dragon could achieve limited flight, enough to intercept a rebellious pastry. He crouched, tensed his hind legs—

The baguette exploded.

Not with fire—that would have been simpler. It expanded, splitting along its crust, releasing a cloud of yeast-scented steam and hundreds of tiny, dough-based spores. They filled the air like snow. Campers shrieked with laughter. Zeno inhaled a spore and hiccuped, floating six inches off the ground himself.

Zeph stood in the center of the cloud, covered in flour, his hair white with dust. He looked at Cornelius with an expression of exhausted defeat.

"I got this," Zeph said. His voice lacked conviction.

"You do not have this," Cornelius said. He shook spores from his scales. "You have created a particulate hazard. You have—"

"I didn't make the loaf go crazy," Zeph said. "Zeno did. I'm just the one trying to catch it." He dropped the canvas sack. "Forget it. I'm gonna check the... the supplies. In the barn."

He walked away. His shoulders hunched. The campers ignored him, chasing floating spores and the remaining baguette fragments. Cornelius felt a prickle of disorder along his spine. The boy was retreating. Abandoning his post. Displaying a lack of professional discipline that bordered on—

He stopped. Zeph was heading toward the Sanctuary Barn. The Sanctuary Barn contained the dovecote. The dovecote contained Lukas.

Cornelius leaped from the press stone and followed.

The humidity hit him as he crossed the camp grounds. He ignored it, focusing instead on the trail of flour Zeph left behind—a white breadcrumb path across the stone pavers. The boy moved with purpose now, no longer the slouching teenager pretending to competence, but something tighter. More urgent.

Cornelius reached the Barn's side entrance. He pushed open the heavy wooden door with his shoulder. The interior smelled of hay, old stone, and—faintly, troublingly—of sea salt and ancient paper. The rogue scent from the crime scene. He pushed the association aside. He had secured the evidence. The contamination was contained.

"Zeph," Cornelius called.

Silence.

Cornelius climbed the ladder to the loft. His claws found the rungs with practiced precision. The upper level opened into shadow and dust motes. The dovecote stood against the far wall, its wire mesh glinting. But the door was open. And the dovecote was empty.

Panic—cold and precise—stabbed through Cornelius's chest. He scanned the rafters.

Lukas perched upon the highest beam, a grey shadow against the dark wood. The pigeon was agitated, feathers puffed, wings half-extended. He had not been eating. Cornelius could see it in the angle of his head, the frantic swivel of his neck. Seventy-two hours remained until the parents arrived, and the subject was deteriorating.

Zeph sat on a hay bale below the rafter. He held something in his hands—a fragment of the exploded Floaty-Loaf, still emitting a faint yellow glow. He was tearing off small pieces. He did not look at Cornelius. He looked at the bird.

"Hey, Lukas," Zeph said softly. "C'mon, buddy. Look what I got."

The pigeon cooed—a sharp, anxious sound.

"I know," Zeph said. "The exploding bread was scary. But this piece is good. See? It floats."

Zeph released a crumb. It did not fall. It drifted upward, rotating slowly, caught in the residual enchantment. The yellow magic pulsed, steady, gentle. The crumb rose to the height of the rafter and hung there, suspended.

Lukas tilted his head. One eye fixed upon the floating bread.

"Yeah," Zeph whispered. "Just like the donuts. You liked the donuts, remember? Come get the floaty bread."

The pigeon shifted on the beam. He hopped once, twice. Then, with a flutter of wings that scattered dust into the light, he descended. He did not fly to Zeph. He flew to the crumb. He hovered beside it—impossibly, a pigeon hanging in mid-air next to a floating piece of baguette—and pecked. The crumb dissolved. Lukas remained suspended, standing on nothing, his claws gripping the air as if it were stone.

Zeph released another piece. It drifted higher. Lukas followed, rising with it, his panic subsiding into curiosity. The yellow magic surrounded him, stable, predictable. He cooed—not the frantic sound from before, but a low, contented rumble.

Cornelius stood frozen upon the ladder. He watched Zeph work. The boy's hands moved with a patience Cornelius had never observed in him before. He did not grab. He did not chase. He offered. He waited. The metallic bronze sheen of his hair seemed to catch the dim light of the barn, and Cornelius remembered, belatedly, the boy's file. Lamassu-touched. A heritage of beast-affinity, of sanctuary guardianship. Zeph had not been failing to manage the campers. He had been failing to pretend he cared about their chaos. But here, with a creature who needed quiet, he was suddenly competent.

"You're doing well," Cornelius said. He did not mean to say it. The words escaped his formal filter.

Zeph startled. The bread fragment tumbled. Lukas dove, caught it mid-air, and landed upon Zeph's knee. The boy froze. The pigeon looked up at him, crumbs on his beak, and cooed.

"Don't move," Cornelius said, climbing into the loft proper. "You have established trust. Do not break it."

"I didn't do anything," Zeph said. His voice was barely audible. "I just... I know what it's like. Being stuck somewhere weird. Wanting to fly away."

Cornelius approached slowly. He observed the scene with his forensic precision. Lukas was calm. The yellow magic of the Floaty-Loaf surrounded him, not as a spell upon him, but as an environment he inhabited. The anti-gravity bread had created a space where a boy trapped in a bird's body could remember weightlessness. Could remember flying without fear.

"The Giggle-Glaze," Cornelius said slowly. "The levitation. He remembers the safety of it."

"Yeah," Zeph said. He stroked Lukas's feathers with one finger. The pigeon permitted it. "He's scared of being trapped. But when things float... he's okay. It's like he remembers being human, when stuff was magic and fun."

Cornelius sat upon an adjacent hay bale. His tail curled around his feet. He looked at Zeph—really looked at him—and saw not the sullen teenager who forgot his title, but a caretaker who had found his charge.

"You have been feeding him the Floaty-Loaf," Cornelius observed.

"Just the broken pieces," Zeph said. "After the explosion. I thought... I don't know. I thought he might like something that doesn't sit still. Like him."

Cornelius considered this. The mystery of the rogue crumb—the sea salt and ancient paper, the narrative magic—still haunted his investigation. But here, in the dim loft, a different kind of magic was operating. Simple, stable, yellow. Domestic. Cozy. The kind of magic that mended pots and cooled milk and made bread drift instead of fall.

And it was working.

The campers outside were screaming with joy as they chased spores. Zeno was floating in the Pergola. Thais was measuring aerodynamics. And here, in the shadow of the dovecote, a transformed boy was eating breadcrumbs from a teenager's hand, suspended in the one kind of magic that made him feel safe.

"You have restored his equilibrium," Cornelius said. He adjusted his spectacles. "I did not anticipate this application."

"Is that... is that good?" Zeph asked.

"It is sufficient," Cornelius said. Then, forcing the words through his rigid jaw: "It is commendable."

Zeph looked up, surprised. Lukas pecked at his palm, demanding more bread. The boy smiled—a small, hesitant expression—and released another floating crumb.

Cornelius watched the yellow magic pulse. He thought of the rogue crumb in his pocket, the discordant melody of the narrative spell, the seventy-two hours remaining. He thought of his vow: *I have mended books. I shall restore this child.*

He had been looking for complex rituals. For ancient counter-spells. For control.

But perhaps, he realized, looking at the pigeon floating gently beside a piece of bread, the path to restoration was not through rigidity. Perhaps it was through the kind of chaos that let a boy breathe.

"We shall require more Floaty-Loaves," Cornelius said. "For therapeutic purposes."

Zeph nodded, still stroking Lukas's feathers. "Okay, Boss."

"Do not call me Boss," Cornelius said. But his tone lacked its usual bite. "Continue your... herding."

He turned to descend the ladder. Behind him, he heard Zeph whispering to the pigeon, and the soft, contented coo of a boy who had momentarily forgotten he was trapped.

Cornelius paused at the door. He looked back once, at the floating bread, the calm bird, and the boy who had finally found his place in the chaos.

"Carry on," Cornelius said.

Then he stepped into the afternoon, leaving them to their levitation.
