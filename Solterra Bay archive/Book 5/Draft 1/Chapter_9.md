Chapter 9

Cornelius Drake arranged the ceramic jars upon the pantry shelf with the precision of a mortician organizing surgical instruments. The Pergola’s stone walls surrounded him, ancient and solid, filtering the night air into something still and heavy. Above, the grapevine lattice blocked the sky, creating a ceiling of woven shadows. He placed the smallest jar—containing dried basil—exactly three inches from the edge of the shelf, parallel to the mortar line between the stones.

“Boss,” Zeph whispered. The boy sat upon an overturned crate near the pantry entrance, his knees drawn up to his chest, his hair catching what little light filtered from the main kitchen hearth. “Are you sure about this?”

“I am certain,” Cornelius said. He did not look up from his task. He adjusted the jar one quarter-inch to the left. “The evidence is conclusive. The blue dye packet found in the suspect’s possession matches the chromatic signature of previous disruptions. Zeno is the primary vector. He will return to the scene to either contaminate additional supplies or retrieve incriminating materials.”

“He’s just hungry,” Zeph said. His voice carried the particular flatness of exhaustion. “He’s a growing satyr. They eat constantly. You saw him counting hay earlier. He’s probably starving.”

“Hunger is a biological constant,” Cornelius said. He turned, his claws clicking against the stone floor. “Sabotage is a choice. We are not observing a metabolic process. We are intercepting a criminal conspiracy.”

Zeph rubbed his eyes. “Right. A conspiracy. Between Zeno and… who? The ghost of a cookbook?”

“The accomplice remains unidentified,” Cornelius admitted. He moved to the sideboard, where the basket of rejected Mood-Muffins sat beneath a linen cloth. “However, the primary vector is contained. Once we apprehend Zeno in the act of tampering with these muffins, he will confess the identity of his collaborator. Or he will demonstrate the method by which he introduces the narrative contaminants.”

Cornelius lifted the cloth. The muffins sat in perfect rows, arranged with geometric precision. Pippa’s work. The iridescent dust upon their surfaces caught the faint light from the kitchen, shifting between violet and green. Decorative. Harmless. A testament to orderly assistance.

“You’re really going to use those as bait?” Zeph asked.

“They are the control sample,” Cornelius said. “The suspect believes these muffins are merely rejected refreshments, destined for tomorrow’s afternoon assembly. He does not know that I have cataloged their exact position, weight, and particulate composition. If he attempts to add his blue dye—or if he attempts to remove them to prevent analysis—we shall observe the variance.”

Zeph shifted on his crate. “And if he just eats them?”

“Then he will ingest a significant quantity of truth-verification root,” Cornelius said. “The Mood-Muffins will react to his deception. They will turn crimson in his stomach. The physical discomfort will be considerable, but the magical exposure will force honesty. Either way, we obtain a confession.”

Zeph stared at the muffins. “Those look sparkly.”

“Pippa applied decorative sugar,” Cornelius said. He felt a warmth in his chest, a stabilization of his internal pressure. “She is a constant. Reliable. She arranged them with mathematical precision. This basket represents order within chaos. The suspect will be drawn to it precisely because it represents a vulnerability in my perimeter.”

“If you say so, Boss.”

“I do say so,” Cornelius said. He checked his internal chronometer. 11:47 PM. “Now. Extinction of light.”

He blew out the kitchen lantern. The Pergola plunged into darkness, save for the faint glow of embers in the main hearth, twenty feet away. Cornelius settled behind a flour barrel, positioning himself with his wings folded tight against his sides. He had a clear sightline to the sideboard. He had calculated the angles of approach. The stone floor would amplify any footsteps. The air was still, preserving scent trails.

Zeph sighed and leaned his head against the stone wall. Within minutes, his breathing deepened into the rhythm of sleep.

Cornelius did not sleep. He watched.

Time passed with the viscosity of cold honey. Cornelius cataloged the sounds of the camp at night: the creak of the olive press in the distant barn, the rustle of leaves against the Villa’s stone facade, the distant hoot of the owl that had failed to deliver its poisoned report. He checked his chronometer every seventeen minutes, precisely.

At 1:15 AM, a sound reached his ears. A soft scrape, ceramic against stone, from the direction of the main path.

Cornelius’s scales prickled. He extended his neck slightly, peering over the flour barrel.

A figure moved through the darkness, silhouetted against the faint glow from the kitchen hearth. The shape was lanky, horned, moving with the exaggerated stealth of someone who had never actually practiced stealth. The blue hair was visible even in the dim light—a chemical shade, unnatural, the color of chaos.

Zeno.

The satyr-kin paused at the entrance to the pantry, his hooves clicking softly against the tiles. He looked left, then right. His nostrils flared. He was hunting by scent.

Cornelius held his breath. His claws gripped the edge of the barrel. *Got him*, he thought. The phrase repeated in his mind like a mantra. *Got him. Got him. Got him.*

Zeno crept forward. He moved past the hanging copper pots—silent, careful. He avoided the sack of rice that Cornelius had deliberately placed as a trip hazard. He navigated with the specific knowledge of someone who knew the kitchen’s layout.

He reached the sideboard.

Cornelius tensed. His wings prepared for launch. He would wait until the exact moment of contamination. He would observe the introduction of the blue dye, or the removal of the evidence, or—

Zeno lifted the linen cloth.

He looked down at the muffins. He sniffed. Then, with the speed of a striking serpent, he seized two muffins and stuffed them both into his mouth.

Cornelius froze.

Zeno chewed. His cheeks bulged. Crumbs tumbled down his tunic. He made a sound—*mmph*—of intense satisfaction. He reached for a third muffin.

That was not tampering. That was not sabotage.

That was gluttony.

“Halt!” Cornelius roared.

He launched from behind the barrel, his wings snapping open, his claws extended. He hit the stone floor with a crack that echoed off the pantry walls. Zeno jumped, his hooves skidding on the tiles, his eyes wide. A spray of muffin crumbs erupted from his mouth.

“You are destroying the evidence!” Cornelius shouted. He advanced, his tail lashing, his spectacles slipping down his snout. “Cease ingestion immediately! Spit out the contraband!”

Zeno tried to swallow. He choked. He coughed, spraying a cloud of violet-green dust and half-chewed muffin across the sideboard. “Glurk,” he said.

Zeph crashed awake, falling off his crate. “What? Who? Boss?”

“The suspect is consuming the control sample!” Cornelius shrieked. He pointed a trembling claw at Zeno. “He is eating the evidence! He is destroying the proof of his conspiracy!”

Zeno managed to swallow. He held up his hands, one still clutching a half-eaten muffin. “I wasn’t destroying anything!” he gasped. “I was hungry! The hay in the barn tastes terrible!”

“You expect me to believe that this”—Cornelius snatched at the remaining muffins in the basket, holding one up to the light—“this precise, calculated consumption is merely appetite? You are eliminating the contaminated specimens to prevent forensic analysis!”

“I’m eliminating them because they’re delicious!” Zeno said. He took another bite of the muffin in his hand, despite everything. “Pippa made them pretty. They taste like… like stars. And sugar. And something crunchy.”

Zeph stumbled forward, rubbing his face. “Boss, he’s just eating. Look at him. He’s not adding dye. He’s not planting anything. He’s just… chewing.”

“He is removing the evidence from the crime scene,” Cornelius said. His voice rose in pitch, approaching the frequency that made glassware vibrate. “These muffins contain the trace particulates of the narrative magic! He is digesting the proof!”

Zeno swallowed again. He looked down at the half-eaten muffin in his hand. His expression shifted from terror to confusion. “Wait. These are the magic ones? The ones that make you tell the truth?”

“They are the Mood-Muffins modified with decorative enhancements,” Cornelius said. He advanced another step, cornering Zeno against the sideboard. “You have ingested a truth-compulsion substrate. You will now answer my questions without the capacity for deception. Who is your accomplice? How did you introduce the bibliomantic contamination? What is the reversal protocol for the transformed campers?”

Zeno blinked. He looked at the muffin. Then he looked at Cornelius. Then he took another bite.

“I don’t have an accomplice,” Zeno said, his mouth full. “And I don’t know anything about bibli-whatever. I just wanted a snack. The blue hair dye is for my roots. My mom says I have to look respectable for Family Day. She says blue is the color of mischief, but also loyalty. It’s complicated.”

The muffin in Zeno’s hand began to glow. Not the yellow of calm, nor the crimson of deception. It shifted to a pale, thoughtful amber, then to a deep, resonant violet.

Cornelius stared. “The muffin is reacting.”

“Yeah,” Zeno said. He looked at the glowing pastry with interest. “It feels warm. Like a little coal in my stomach.”

“You are experiencing the truth-verification effects,” Cornelius said. He tried to regain his prosecutorial momentum. “You cannot lie. The magic compels honesty. Now: admit that you are the saboteur!”

Zeno chewed slowly. The violet glow intensified, spreading from the muffin up his arm, casting his blue hair in an even more unnatural light. He swallowed. He looked Cornelius directly in the eyes.

“I am not the saboteur,” Zeno said. His voice was clear, ringing, devoid of its usual mischief. “I am just hungry and bored and I wanted to make the bread float higher that one time. But I didn’t turn anyone into a pigeon. I didn’t turn Maya into a turtle. I just wanted things to be more exciting. But I didn’t do the big magic. I don’t know how.”

The muffin crumbled in his hand, turning to dust that sparkled with violet and green iridescence.

Zeph stepped forward. “Boss. He’s telling the truth.”

“He is experiencing a magical compulsion to appear sincere,” Cornelius snapped. But his certainty was developing hairline fractures. He could see the glow. He could hear the tone. Zeno’s words carried the weight of veracity.

“I didn’t do it,” Zeno said again. The violet light faded from his skin, leaving him looking small and tired and very, very full. “Can I go back to the barn now? I feel weird. And I think I’m going to float.”

As if to punctuate his statement, Zeno hiccupped. A small puff of violet dust emerged from his mouth, drifting upward toward the grapevine lattice.

Cornelius stood frozen, his claws extended, his accusation dying in his throat. He had planned for sabotage. He had prepared for contamination. He had not prepared for simple, adolescent hunger.

The basket of muffins sat between them, several now missing, the remainder still dusted with Pippa’s iridescent sugar. Decorative. Harmless. A constant.

Cornelius’s spectacles slipped further down his snout. He did not push them up.

“Sixty-two hours,” Cornelius whispered.

“What?” Zeph asked.

“Nothing,” Cornelius said. He stepped back from Zeno. He looked at the empty space in the basket where the muffins had been. He looked at the blue-haired satyr, who was now gently burping violet sparks.

Cornelius had caught his suspect. He had caught him red-handed, or rather, crumb-handed. But he had not caught him committing sabotage.

He had caught him having a midnight snack.

“Return to the barn,” Cornelius said, his voice hollow. “Both of you. The stakeout is concluded.”

Zeno needed no further encouragement. He stumbled past, leaving a trail of glowing crumbs that faded after three feet. Zeph followed, pausing only to look back at Cornelius with an expression that was not quite pity, but close.

Cornelius remained alone in the pantry. He approached the sideboard. He picked up the remaining muffins, one by one, examining them in the dim light. They were pretty. They were orderly. They were covered in decorative sugar that shifted between violet and green.

He thought of Pippa, arranging them with geometric precision. He thought of Zeno, eating them with desperate hunger. He thought of the empty vial he had found beneath the olive tree.

Cornelius placed the muffins back in the basket. He covered them with the linen cloth. Then he sat down upon the stone floor, his wings drooping, his tail curled around his feet.

He had been so certain.

Outside, somewhere in the dark, an owl hooted. Cornelius did not look up. He sat in the silence of the pantry, surrounded by stone and ceramic and the faint smell of basil, and waited for the dawn that he could not see.
