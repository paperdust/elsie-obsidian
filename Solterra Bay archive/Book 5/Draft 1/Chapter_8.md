Chapter 8

Cornelius Drake perched upon the Stone Villa’s porch railing, his claws gripping the terracotta with precisely calibrated pressure. The morning air carried the weight of impending catastrophe. He could taste it—a metallic tang beneath the olive dust and ceramic glaze that defined Camp Olea’s atmosphere.

Little Kyria stood at the stone table, her posture rigid as a filing cabinet. The orcish girl wore a sash across her tunic emblazoned with the Council’s seal—a silver owl clutching a scroll. In her hands, she held a leather tube containing the report. Cornelius had watched her compile it over the past hour, ticking items into her ledger with the merciless efficiency of a tax assessor.

“Violation seven,” Kyria announced, reading from her notepad. She did not look up. “Accumulation of organic particulate in the Sanctuary Barn rafters. Severity: moderate. Violation eight: Improper containment of alchemical reagents in the Pergola kitchen. Severity: high.”

Cornelius’s tail thrashed against the railing. The motion sent a chip of plaster tumbling to the tiles below. “Those are not violations. They are established features. The particulate is historical. The reagents are properly sealed.”

Kyria made a notation. Her pencil scratched against the paper with a sound like dry leaves burning. “Interpretation noted. Overruled.”

She reached for the courier cage. The brass enclosure sat upon the table, large enough to house a single owl. Inside, a barn owl with chestnut plumage ruffled its feathers and clicked its beak. Kyria slid the leather tube through the slot. The seal clicked shut with a sound that echoed in Cornelius’s ribcage like a dropped ledger.

“Once the courier departs,” Kyria said, adjusting her spectacles, “the Council will receive the documentation within six hours. The inspection will be escalated to Priority Red. The funding review will commence immediately.”

Cornelius’s scales prickled. The sensation started at his spine and radiated outward, each bronze plate lifting slightly from his skin. He calculated the variables. Two transformed campers hidden in the barn. A third possibly hopping across the grounds on enchanted breadcrumbs. And now this—a bureaucratic missile aimed directly at his hoard.

Imelda emerged from the Villa’s interior, carrying a tray. She moved with the fluid grace of deep water, her silver braids swinging against her copper beads. She placed the tray upon the table—three cups of mint tea, steam rising in mathematically perfect columns.

“Kyria,” Imelda said. “Perhaps we might review the distinction between patina and pathology. The dust in the barn is eighty years old. It is heritage.”

Kyria did not touch the tea. “Heritage is not a recognized exemption in Council Regulation 44-B. Cleanliness standards apply regardless of historical sentiment.” She reached for the cage latch. “I am releasing the courier.”

Cornelius leaped from the railing. His wings snapped open for balance, the three-foot span casting a shadow across the terracotta. He landed upon the table with a click of claws against stone. “Wait.”

Kyria paused. Her hand hovered over the latch. “The timeline is non-negotiable, Librarian Drake.”

“Procedure requires a final manifest check,” Cornelius said. He leaned forward, his snout inches from the cage bars. The owl blinked at him with liquid indifference. “You must verify the recipient seal. If the tube is misaddressed, the chain of custody is compromised.”

Kyria frowned. She consulted her notepad. “The address is correct. Council Oversight Committee, Main Hall, Solterra Bay.”

“But the seal wax,” Cornelius said, grasping for variables. “If the wax is insufficient, moisture could penetrate the tube. The ink could run. The violations would become illegible. You would be reporting incomplete data. That is a violation of your own protocols.”

Kyria hesitated. Her finger tapped against the cage. The owl hooted—a low, judgmental sound.

From the kitchen alcove came a sound like a sigh, but wetter. Cornelius turned his head. Cassius stood in the doorway, his hands dusted with flour, his eyes wide and white as boiled eggs. The satyr-kin baker held a ceramic crock against his chest. The vessel was vibrating.

“Cassius,” Imelda said calmly. “Is there a problem?”

“The starter,” Cassius whispered. His voice cracked on the second syllable. “I left it on the counter. I was supposed to refrigerate it after the second feeding. But then the Sparkroot incident, and the counting, and Zeno’s containment—”

The crock shuddered. A bubble emerged from under the lid, large as a plum, and popped with a sound like a cork gun. Yeast scent—sharp, aggressive, alive—flooded the porch.

Cornelius’s nostrils flared. “That is not standard sourdough.”

“It is now,” Cassius said. “It has been proofing for thirty hours. In this humidity. With the wild yeasts in the air. I think—”

The lid blew off.

The dough did not simply rise. It erupted. A pale, elastic mass surged upward from the crock, billowing over the rim like a slow-motion fountain. It was the color of bone and the texture of living silk. It expanded in pulses, each surge accompanied by a wet, fermenting hiss.

“Migrating sourdough,” Imelda said. She set down her tea cup. “Cassius, step back.”

Cassius stumbled backward into a pillar. The dough crept across the threshold of the kitchen, flowing over the terracotta tiles in a viscous tide. It moved with purpose, guided by the internal pressure of carbon dioxide and wild magic. A bubble the size of Cornelius’s head formed on its surface and burst, splattering the porch railing with sticky strands.

Kyria shrieked—a high, official sound of indignation. She grabbed for the courier cage. “The report!”

The dough reached the table.

It did not stop. It flowed around the legs, lifting the stone slab slightly with its mass. The cage slid toward the edge. Kyria snatched at it, but her fingers sank into the dough’s surface up to her knuckles. She pulled back with a sound of disgust, leaving her hand coated in sticky, elastic strands.

“Containment!” Cornelius shouted. He spread his wings, creating a barrier between the dough and the cage. “We require containment!”

The dough enveloped the cage.

It did not crush the bars. Instead, it infiltrated them, seeping through the brass lattice like water through a sieve. The owl hooted in panic, flapping its wings, but the dough rose around it, encasing the bird in a sphere of yeasty insulation. The leather tube disappeared into the pale mass.

“It is eating the report,” Kyria said. Her voice had gone flat with horror.

“It is not eating,” Cornelius snapped. He prodded the dough with a claw. It clung to his scales, stretching in long, gossamer threads. “It is engulfing. There is a difference. Cassius, neutralize the fermentation.”

“I cannot!” Cassius wailed. He was pressed against the Villa wall, his hooves skittering on the tiles. “It has achieved self-sustaining momentum. It is drawing moisture from the air. It will stop when it runs out of sugar. Or when it reaches the sea.”

The dough expanded across the porch, a living carpet of gluten and wild yeast. It filled the cracks between the terracotta tiles. It climbed the blue shutters, sealing them shut with a paste of flour and water. It reached the ceiling of the porch and hung in dripping stalactites, each drop falling with a heavy, wet splat.

Cornelius found himself standing on the table, the only dry surface remaining. Kyria stood beside him, her notepad clutched to her chest, her face spattered with flecks of dough. Imelda had retreated to the top step, her expression unreadable.

“The Council,” Kyria whispered. “They must know.”

“They will know nothing,” Cornelius said. He shook his claw, trying to dislodge a strand of dough that had wrapped around his wrist like a manacle. “The report is encapsulated. The courier is incapacitated. The transmission has failed.”

A figure appeared in the garden below the porch steps. Zeno stood there, his blue-dyed hair matted with leaves, his tunic askew. He had apparently climbed out of the Sanctuary Barn window, despite his assignment to Special Night Watch. He stared at the dough with his mouth open.

“Whoa,” Zeno said. “It is like a bread avalanche.”

“Do not move,” Cornelius commanded. He pointed at the satyr-kin with his free claw. “You are contaminating the scene. Return to your containment parameters immediately.”

Zeno took a step forward. His hoof sank into the dough, which had begun to flow down the steps in slow, rippling waves. “I just came to see what the screaming was about. Is that the owl?”

The cage was completely submerged now, visible only as a dark shape within the pale mass. The dough had formed a perfect sphere around it, glistening in the shade of the porch. The owl had stopped hooting. Cornelius could see its feathers pressing against the brass bars, encased in the sticky medium.

“It is a disaster,” Kyria said. She sat down heavily on the table. “My report is inside that... that...”

“Artifact,” Imelda supplied. She descended the steps, her feet finding purchase on the dough’s surface as if walking on snow. “Cassius, fetch the shovels. We shall need to excavate the cage before the dough hardens.”

“It will not harden,” Cassius moaned. He slid down the wall to sit on the tiles, his head in his hands. “It will just keep growing. It is a biological engine. It is unstoppable.”

Imelda reached the bottom step. She examined the dough with a critical eye. “Then we shall bake it.”

Everyone stopped.

Imelda turned to face them. Her copper beads clicked in the silence. “The Pergola ovens are still warm from the morning bread. If we section the dough and bake it, we arrest the fermentation. We recover the cage. We salvage the situation.”

Cornelius felt a surge of professional respect. “That is... tactically sound.”

“It will require coordination,” Imelda said. “And it will require that everyone stop standing in the evidence.”

Cornelius looked down. The dough had risen to cover his feet. He pulled one claw free with a sucking sound. The strand stretched, thinned, and snapped, recoiling into the main mass.

Zeno laughed. The sound was high and sharp. “Look at your face, Boss. You have a dough beard.”

Cornelius touched his snout. His claws came away coated in sticky white paste. He felt his scales prickle—not with anxiety, but with indignation. “This is not humorous. This is a Category Three Biological Hazard. Imelda, I require a towel.”

“Later,” Imelda said. She was already moving toward the kitchen, her steps leaving precise impressions in the dough. “First, we recover the report.”

For the next hour, the porch became a battlefield of domestic engineering. Imelda directed the operation with the calm authority of a general. Cassius, galvanized by the prospect of baking his own disaster into submission, directed the firing of the clay ovens. Kyria stood at the top of the steps, directing the excavation with her notepad, marking each recovered item with a check.

They did not use shovels. Shovels would have damaged the cage. Instead, they used wooden paddles—tools meant for sliding bread into ovens—and long-handled spoons. They scooped the dough in sections, passing it hand to hand in a bucket brigade, depositing it into the beehive ovens.

Cornelius worked beside Zeno. The satyr-kin had been pressed into service, his punishment for escaping containment commuted into labor. They stood on either side of the cage, using wooden spatulas to scrape away the dough that encased it.

“It is like excavating a fossil,” Cornelius muttered. He scraped a layer of dough from the brass bars. The owl inside blinked at him, covered in flour but alive.

“More like digging out a treasure chest,” Zeno said. He reached into the dough with his bare hands, pulling out a handful of the sticky mass. “Hey, this is good dough. Feel the elasticity. Perfect gluten development.”

“Do not play with the hazard,” Cornelius snapped. He knocked Zeno’s hand away. The motion sent a clump of dough flying. It struck the blue shutter with a wet thwack.

They worked in silence for a time, the only sounds the slap of dough against wood and the crackle of the ovens. Slowly, the cage emerged. First the top bars, then the leather tube wedged against the side, then the owl itself—bedraggled, furious, but unharmed.

“I have the report,” Kyria announced. She held up the leather tube. It was coated in a thin film of yeast, but the seal remained intact. “However, the courier is compromised. The owl is... unsuitable for flight.”

The bird sat in the center of the cage, looking like a powdered pastry. It ruffled its feathers, sending up a cloud of flour that made Cornelius sneeze.

“We shall clean the courier,” Imelda said. She wiped her hands on her apron. “Or we shall request a replacement. The important thing is that the report did not depart.”

Cornelius felt a tension release in his chest—a sensation like a book sliding perfectly into place on a shelf. The crisis had been averted. The Council would not receive the damning documentation. The inspection would remain unescalated. He had sixty-two hours remaining to solve the transformation mystery before the parents arrived.

He stepped back from the cage, his claws clicking against the now-clean tiles. The porch was a mess—dough splattered on the walls, flour dusting every surface, the air thick with the scent of baking bread. But the report was secure.

Zeno moved to step away from the cage. As he turned, something fell from his pocket.

It was small. Rectangular. It hit the terracotta with a soft click and skidded slightly, coming to rest against Cornelius’s foot.

Cornelius looked down.

The packet was made of waxed paper, folded tight. The top had been torn open. Spilling from the tear was a powder of intense, artificial blue—the precise shade of a summer sky seen through colored glass. The same shade as Zeno’s hair.

The color of chaos.

Cornelius went still. His breathing stopped. He reached down with one claw and picked up the packet. It was light, nearly weightless. He turned it over. The paper was dusted with flour from Zeno’s pocket, but the blue powder within remained vibrant, unnatural, electric.

Zeno froze. His eyes went wide. “That is not mine.”

“You dropped it,” Cornelius said. His voice was very quiet.

“I mean, it is mine, but it is not what you think. It is just dye. For my hair. I was going to touch up my roots before the parents came. I did not want to look scruffy for Family Day.”

Cornelius opened the packet fully. The blue powder gleamed in the shade of the porch. It was the exact color he had been searching for—the signature of the chaos agent, the marker of the saboteur. He had seen it before, in the Sparkroot incident, in the splashes of color that seemed to follow Zeno’s pranks.

He looked up at Zeno. The satyr-kin’s blue hair suddenly seemed less like a fashion choice and more like a confession written in pigment.

“Got him,” Cornelius said.

He closed his claw around the packet, feeling the crunch of the waxed paper. The evidence was physical. It was tangible. It was real.

Zeno opened his mouth to protest, but Cornelius turned away, already marching toward the library tent. He had his culprit. He had his proof. And he had sixty-two hours to make the charges stick before the world came crashing down upon Camp Olea.
