# The Three Tile Families of Solterra Bay

## The Tile Trade

### Why Tiles?

The mountains ringing the bay are clay-rich. The same soil that frustrates farmers is a blessing for ceramicists. Generations ago, someone discovered that Solterra Bay clay fires to beautiful colors and holds glazes exceptionally well.

### The Reputation

Solterra Bay tiles are known throughout the region—not the most famous (larger cities claim that honor), but recognized for quality, distinctive local styles, and reasonable prices. Ships that come for fish leave with tiles. Buildings across the coast bear Solterra Bay work.

### The Industry

Three master tile families dominate production. Each has their own clay deposits, kilns, workshops, and apprentices. Each guards their glaze recipes jealously. Each claims to be the best.

They're all correct, depending on what you need.

## House Kallistos — "The Old Masters"

### Overview

| Detail | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Established** | Claims eight generations (others say seven—the Kallistos count a "founding ancestor" who was really just a potter) |
| **Sigil/Mark** | A spiral sun stamped into the back of every tile |
| **Location** | Upper town, near the old temple—the original family compound, expanded over centuries |
| **Specialty** | Traditional designs and architectural tiles |

### What They Make

- Roof tiles, floor tiles, structural elements
- Classical patterns: geometric borders, wave motifs, the famous "Kallistos blue"
- The choice for temples, public buildings, wealthy traditional homes
- Philosophy: "If it was good enough for our great-great-grandmother, it's good enough for you"

### The Family

**Patriarch: Master Stavros Kallistos**
- Age 71, still works daily, refuses to fully hand over control
- Fierce guardian of traditional methods
- Believes the other families are "clever but unserious"
- Has grudging respect for quality work regardless of source (would never admit it)

**Heir Apparent: Dimitra Kallistos**
- Stavros's granddaughter, age 34
- Technically brilliant, quietly innovative
- Caught between honoring tradition and knowing the family must evolve
- Unmarried, which the town gossips about endlessly

**The Wild Card: Petros Kallistos**
- Stavros's youngest son, age 45
- Left to study ceramics elsewhere, returned with "foreign ideas"
- Runs a small experimental workshop the family pretends doesn't exist
- His children are being raised "properly traditional" as penance

### Workshop Character

- Ancient kilns, some original to the founding
- Organized, methodical, clean
- Apprentices trained slowly over many years
- The archive of pattern books goes back generations
- Visitors are shown the archive with great ceremony (and subtle condescension)

### Cornelius's Opinion

"The Kallistos tiles in the library's original flooring have survived one hundred and fifty years. I have no complaints. Their social visits to the library, however, tend to involve lengthy commentary on the inadequacy of our building maintenance."

## House Doukas — "The Innovators"

### Overview

| Detail | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Established** | Seven generations, founded by a Kallistos apprentice who left to start his own workshop |
| **Sigil/Mark** | A leaping fish stamped into the back of every tile |
| **Location** | Lower town, near the harbor—purpose-built workshop with the largest kilns in town |
| **Specialty** | Decorative tiles and custom commissions |

### The Founding Grudge

The Doukas founder was a Kallistos apprentice who left to start his own workshop. The Kallistos family has never forgiven this. Seven generations later, the wound is still fresh (to the Kallistos, anyway).

### What They Make

- Pictorial tiles, murals, elaborate patterns
- Vibrant colors, experimental glazes
- The choice for merchants who want to show off, ship captains decorating cabins, anyone who wants something unique
- Philosophy: "Why have plain when you can have beautiful?"

### The Family

**Matriarch: Master Eleni Doukas**
- Age 63, creative genius, terrible businesswoman
- Has invented more glaze colors than anyone in three generations
- Keeps experimenting instead of producing reliable inventory
- Beloved by artists, frustrating to customers who want their order on time

**The Practical One: Nikolas Doukas**
- Eleni's son, age 40
- Runs the actual business while his mother creates
- Good craftsman, not brilliant—but organized, reliable, diplomatic
- Secretly exhausted by managing his mother's chaos

**The Prodigy: Sophia Doukas**
- Nikolas's daughter, age 19
- Inherited her grandmother's creativity AND her father's discipline
- Already producing work that rivals the masters
- The other families are watching her nervously

**The Charmer: Alexandros Doukas**
- Eleni's brother, age 58
- The family's salesman and public face
- Knows everyone, drinks with ship captains, never met a stranger
- His promises sometimes exceed the workshop's capacity (Nikolas's headache)

### Workshop Character

- Controlled chaos—tiles in progress everywhere
- Color experiments drying on every surface
- The "good kiln" and the "experimental kiln" (the experimental one explodes occasionally)
- Apprentices encouraged to try things (sometimes disastrously)
- Visitors either love the energy or flee in horror

### Cornelius's Opinion

"The Doukas family donated a decorative tile panel to the library forty years ago. It depicts a dragon reading a book. The proportions are inaccurate, the coloring is fanciful, and the dragon appears to be *smiling*. I have been unable to convince Imelda to remove it to the basement."

## House Veneti — "The Merchants"

### Overview

| Detail | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Established** | Seven generations, founded by a tile trader who married into a small pottery family |
| **Sigil/Mark** | An anchor stamped into the back of every tile |
| **Location** | Middle town, sprawling compound including workshops, warehouses, and a showroom |
| **Specialty** | Production volume and export trade |

### What They Make

- Reliable, consistent, well-priced tiles
- Standard patterns executed flawlessly
- The choice for builders, developers, anyone ordering in quantity
- Philosophy: "A Veneti tile in every home"

### The Family

**Head of House: Master Kostas Veneti**
- Age 55, businessman first, craftsman second
- Expanded the family's trade network dramatically
- More interested in contracts than kilns
- Respects the other families' artistry but considers them commercially naive

**The Craftsman: Thalia Veneti**
- Kostas's wife, age 52
- Actual master ceramicist who ensures quality
- Quietly furious that her husband gets credit for "Veneti quality"
- Teaches the apprentices; Kostas handles the customers

**The Heir: Markos Veneti**
- Age 28, being groomed to take over
- Genuinely interested in craft (to his father's mixed feelings)
- Has been spending suspicious amounts of time studying Kallistos techniques
- May be falling for Dimitra Kallistos (this would cause a scandal)

**The Trader: Captain Yiannis Veneti**
- Kostas's brother, age 50
- Runs the family's trading ship
- Carries Veneti tiles to other ports, brings back supplies and gossip
- Technically a sea captain; practically a family ambassador

### Workshop Character

- Efficient, organized, almost industrial
- Multiple kilns running on schedules
- Apprentices trained in specific tasks (less artistry, more production)
- The showroom is the real heart—samples of everything, price lists, order forms
- Visitors are treated as potential customers (because they are)

### Cornelius's Opinion

"The Veneti supplied the replacement tiles when the library's east corridor was repaired thirty years ago. Adequate work. Delivered on time. I suspect they overcharged, but Imelda handled the negotiations and refuses to discuss the details, which suggests I am correct."

## The Rivalry

### The Public Face

The three families maintain elaborate courtesy:
- They attend each other's family celebrations
- They praise each other's work (with subtle qualifications)
- They sit together at town festivals
- They compete over whose tiles decorate festival booths
- They would never openly disparage a competitor

### The Private Reality

**Kallistos vs. Doukas:**
The oldest grudge. The Kallistos have never forgiven the founding "betrayal." The Doukas consider the Kallistos hidebound and arrogant. They compete for prestige commissions.

*Current tension:* Sophia Doukas's emerging talent threatens Kallistos dominance in decorative work. Dimitra Kallistos is watching carefully.

**Kallistos vs. Veneti:**
Professional disdain. The Kallistos consider the Veneti "mere merchants" who've sacrificed artistry for profit. The Veneti consider the Kallistos snobs who don't understand business.

*Current tension:* Markos Veneti's interest in Dimitra Kallistos. Both families are pretending not to notice.

**Doukas vs. Veneti:**
The friendliest rivalry. Eleni Doukas and Thalia Veneti actually like each other (fellow craftswomen surrounded by family business nonsense). Their husbands compete for commercial contracts.

*Current tension:* Alexandros Doukas promised a ship captain a custom commission that the workshop can't deliver on time. The captain is now talking to Veneti instead.

### The Unwritten Rules

1. **Never poach apprentices** — Training someone who started at another family is deeply taboo
2. **Never sabotage** — Competition is fierce but fair; the town would turn on anyone who cheated
3. **Defend the trade** — Against outsiders, the three families are united; Solterra Bay tiles are the best
4. **Share the festivals** — Each family decorates one third of the town square for major celebrations
5. **Respect the masters** — Young rivals may snipe; masters acknowledge each other's skill

## Tiles in Daily Life

### Where You See Them

| Location | Typical Tiles | Who Made Them |
|----------|---------------|---------------|
| **Temple floors** | Classical geometric, blue and white | Kallistos (always) |
| **Temple walls** | Decorative panels, religious imagery | Doukas (usually) |
| **Wealthy homes** | Custom designs, family patterns | Depends on allegiance |
| **Merchant houses** | Quality standard patterns | Veneti or Kallistos |
| **Taverns and shops** | Durable, simple, colorful | Veneti (affordable) |
| **Fountains** | Elaborate decorative work | Doukas (showpieces) |
| **Thresholds** | Protective symbols, welcome patterns | All three compete |
| **Ships' cabins** | Custom commissions | Doukas (captains like unique) |
| **The Library** | Mix of old Kallistos floors, Doukas dragon panel, Veneti repairs | Diplomatic balance |

### What Tiles Mean

- **Having custom tiles** signals wealth and taste
- **Which family you commission** signals social allegiance
- **The condition of your tiles** signals how you maintain your household
- **Threshold tiles** are semi-sacred—protective symbols, family marks
- **Broken tiles** are bad luck; replacement is urgent

### The Tile Market

Every market day, all three families have stalls:

- **Kallistos:** Dignified display, classical samples, commissions by appointment
- **Doukas:** Colorful chaos, experimental pieces, Alexandros talking to everyone
- **Veneti:** Organized inventory, price lists, bulk discounts

Watching townspeople choose which stall to visit is a minor social drama.

## The Kilns

### Locations

The kilns are outside town proper—fire risk, smoke, and heat mean residential areas don't want them:

- **Kallistos kilns:** Upper slopes, near their clay deposits, ancient site
- **Doukas kilns:** Harbor edge, easy for shipping, includes the "experimental kiln"
- **Veneti kilns:** Largest operation, multiple kilns, practically a small factory

### Firing Days

When the kilns fire, the whole town knows:
- Smoke visible for miles
- The smell of hot clay and ash
- Workers moving between workshop and kiln
- Everyone wondering what's being made
- Children forbidden from getting too close (they do anyway)

### Kiln Magic

A little magic assists the craft:
- Temperature-sensing charms (consistent firing)
- Smoke-directing enchantments (neighbors appreciate this)
- Minor protection against catastrophic failure

But the craft itself is skill, not magic. A poorly made tile won't be saved by enchantment.

## Story Potential

### Mystery Hooks

- A rare antique tile is found in a missing book—what's the connection?
- Someone is selling fake "Kallistos antiques" to tourists
- A commission goes missing between workshop and customer
- Old tiles in a demolished building reveal a forgotten family secret
- The families' archives contain records someone wants destroyed

### Character Connections

- **Dimitra Kallistos** might use the library for historical pattern research
- **Sophia Doukas** might be an ally for Zeph (similar age, creative, underestimated)
- **Thalia Veneti** might trade gossip with Imelda (practical women in family businesses)
- **Markos Veneti** might be a library patron (convenient excuse to be in Dimitra's part of town)

### Romantic Subplot Potential

The Markos/Dimitra situation has legs:
- He's Veneti; she's Kallistos—families with professional disdain
- He's genuinely interested in craft; she's quietly innovative
- Both are heirs with family expectations
- The library could be neutral ground where they "accidentally" meet

## Quick Reference

| House | Sigil | Specialty | Character | Current Head |
|-------|-------|-----------|-----------|--------------|
| **Kallistos** | Spiral sun | Traditional, architectural | Proud, quality-obsessed | Stavros (71) |
| **Doukas** | Leaping fish | Decorative, innovative | Creative, chaotic | Eleni (63) |
| **Veneti** | Anchor | Production, trade | Practical, commercial | Kostas (55) |

**The Shorthand:**
- Need it ancient and respectable? **Kallistos.**
- Need it beautiful and unique? **Doukas.**
- Need it reliable and affordable? **Veneti.**
