# Health and Healing in Solterra Bay

## Design Principle

Medical magic exists to remove the uncozy. Infection, prolonged suffering, painful procedures, and death from treatable conditions all undermine the cozy atmosphere. Healing magic makes the world feel safe without eliminating all stakes.

## Local Healing: The Temple of Althaia

### Overview

| Detail | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Location** | Small temple near the harbor square |
| **Architecture** | Whitewashed stone with a courtyard herb garden |
| **Deity** | Althaia, goddess of mending (hands, bodies, relationships, pottery—she's not picky) |
| **Atmosphere** | Sunny, calm, smells of herbs and sea air |

### Staff

**Sister Photine** — Head Healer
- Middle-aged human woman
- Practical and unflappable
- Knows everyone's business (patients talk)
- Keeps impeccable borrowing records at the library
- Cornelius has grudging respect for her organizational skills

**Brother Demos** — Junior Healer
- Young half-elf, enthusiastic about poultices
- Always requesting books on exotic ailments he'll never encounter
- Eager, still learning

**2-3 Acolytes**
- Handle herbs, bandages, and minor complaints
- Rotate through training

### What the Local Temple Handles

| Condition | Treatment | Recovery |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| Cuts and wounds | Cleaned, sealed with healing salve, wrapped | Hours to days depending on severity |
| Broken bones | Set and wrapped with mending-charmed splints | Days instead of weeks; clean healing |
| Infections | Purifying poultices draw out corruption | Prevented or cured within a day |
| Fevers and common illness | Cooling compresses, herbal draughts, blessing | A day or two of rest |
| Burns | Soothing salves, pain removal, skin restoration | Minor scarring at worst |
| Childbirth | Pain management, intervention if needed | Much safer than historical reality |
| Dental problems | Pain numbing, extraction if needed, minor restoration | Quick and painless |
| Age-related aches | Ongoing management with warming salves, joint treatments | Comfort, not cure |
| Surgery (minor) | Full pain suppression, accelerated healing | Patient comfortable throughout |

### The Patient Experience

- **Pain is managed first** — No procedure begins until the patient is comfortable
- **Healing is warm** — Patients describe gentle warmth spreading from the healer's hands
- **Recovery is restful** — The temple has cots in a sunny courtyard; patients often nap through treatment
- **Cost is modest** — Donations expected but scaled to ability; no one turned away

### The Herb Garden

Sister Photine maintains a courtyard garden supplying most basic ingredients:

| Herb | Use |
|------|-----|
| **Sea lavender** | Calming, used in pain salves |
| **Sunbright** | Fever reduction |
| **Coastmallow** | Soothes burns and skin irritation |
| **Woundwort** | Promotes clotting and sealing |
| **Sleepwell** | Mild sedative for anxious patients |
| **Clearwater mint** | Settles stomachs, freshens breath |

The garden is a pleasant spot; patients often sit among the herbs during recovery. Cornelius has been known to sun himself on the garden wall, "purely for the warmth, not the company."

### Relationship with the Library

- Sister Photine borrows medical texts (returns books on time—rare)
- The temple's old patient logs and remedy notes were donated to the library
- Brother Demos constantly requests books on exotic ailments
- Cornelius respects Photine's organizational discipline

## Regional Healing: The Healing House of Kyrathos

### Overview

| Detail | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Location** | Kyrathos, the nearest large city |
| **Distance** | One day's sail or two days overland |
| **Institution** | Major temple-hospital complex |
| **Dedication** | Althaia and her divine siblings |
| **Capacity** | Dozens of healers, dedicated wards, rare specialists |

### What Kyrathos Handles

| Condition | Treatment | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Severe trauma | Full reconstruction of damaged tissue | Days of intensive healing |
| Advanced disease | Deep purification, extended treatment | Requires staying in residence |
| Difficult childbirth | Specialist intervention | Families travel for complicated pregnancies |
| Lost limbs | Partial regeneration possible | Expensive and slow; full regrowth impossible |
| Magical poisoning | Specialist alchemist-healers | Samples sent ahead by fast courier |
| Curses and magical afflictions | Trained priest-healers | Requires diagnosis first |
| Plague containment | Quarantine facilities, mass treatment | Town temples send patients and call for aid |

### Cost and Access

- **Serious treatment is expensive** — A family might spend significant savings
- **Charity cases exist** — Temples don't turn away the dying, but paying patients get priority
- **Travel is a burden** — A day's journey when ill is difficult
- **Waiting lists** — Weeks for non-emergency treatments

## What Healing Magic Cannot Do

These limitations preserve narrative stakes while keeping the world cozy:

| Limitation | Narrative Function |
|------------|-------------------|
| **Cannot resurrect the dead** | Death has weight; murder has consequences |
| **Cannot heal old age** | Elders pass naturally; mortality is real |
| **Cannot regrow what's fully lost** | A sailor's missing fingers stay missing |
| **Cannot cure instantly** | Rest and recovery still required |
| **Cannot work at unlimited range** | You must reach a healer; distance creates tension |
| **Cannot heal without consent** | Unwilling patients resist; comatose patients are difficult |
| **Exhausts the healer** | Sister Photine can't treat the whole town in one day |
| **Rare conditions require specialists** | Not every ailment is understood |

## Cozy Implications

### What This Removes From the World

- Graphic descriptions of infected wounds
- Characters dying slowly from treatable illness
- Painful medical procedures
- Childbirth mortality as casual worldbuilding
- "Realistic medieval suffering"

### What This Keeps

- **Minor illness as inconvenience** — A character can have a cold, need rest, miss an event
- **Injury as plot obstacle** — A twisted ankle means staying off it for a day
- **Serious conditions as motivation** — "Her mother is at the Healing House" creates stakes without graphic suffering
- **Healer characters** — Sister Photine as recurring presence and information source
- **Death when narratively appropriate** — If a character dies, it happened; if found injured, they can be saved

## Sample Scene: A Cozy Medical Visit

> Sister Photine tutted, already reaching for the salve that smelled of honey and sea lavender. "Running on the harbor stones again?"
> 
> "Library business," Zeph said, trying to sound dignified despite the blood dripping onto the temple's clean floor.
> 
> "Library business. At your age, I was helping my mother with the nets, not chasing down..." She paused, hands already warm with the healing glow. "What exactly does a library dragon need a sixteen-year-old to chase?"
> 
> The warmth spread through Zeph's knee, the sting fading to a pleasant tingle. They'd learned not to watch—the sight of skin knitting itself together was fascinating but unsettling.
> 
> "Overdue books," they said. "Very overdue."
> 
> "Mmm." Sister Photine's tone suggested she didn't believe a word of it. "There. Stay off it for an hour. And tell that dragon that if he keeps sending you into scrapes, he can come explain himself to me personally."

## Quick Reference

**For minor injuries/illness:** Temple of Althaia in Solterra Bay. Treated same day, modest donation.

**For serious conditions:** Healing House in Kyrathos. Day's travel, significant cost, possible waiting.

**For death:** Cannot be reversed. Stakes remain real.

**Tone:** Healing is warm, painless, and handled by kind professionals. Medical scenes should feel reassuring, not distressing.
