# Solterra Bay Series: Premise Shortlist

A curated list of approved concepts for Book 2 (and beyond), focusing on "Unimportant Books" and "Cornelius's Acquisitions."

## 1. The Botanist's Journal (The Nature Angle)

- **The Hook:** A visiting Elven botanist loses her **Field Journal of Extinct Summer Blooms**. It contains the location of the reappearing "Moon-Scented Orchid."
- **The Backdrop Event:** **The Great Pollination.** Once a decade, glowing fireflies swarm the town. A massive tourist event for romance lovers.
- **The Mystery:** The journal isn't a magical tome; it's just a logbook. But a perfumer wants the orchid to create the "Ultimate Scent," and a conservationist wants to protect it.
- **Why Cornelius Cares:** Zeph is trying to impress a date during the festival and keeps asking Cornelius for flower advice, interfering with the investigation.
- **Vibe:** lush, romantic, floral.

## 2. The Mayor's Romance Novel (The Reputation Angle)

- **The Hook:** A manuscript titled _The Lusty Centaur_, terrible fanfiction written by Mayor Tanit Barca under a pseudonym, vanishes from the library worktable.
- **The Backdrop Event:** **The Town Council Elections.**
- **The Mystery:** Blackmail. Someone knows she wrote it and is threatening to read it publicly. The thief isn't a master criminal; it's a political rival.
- **Why Cornelius Cares:** Unless he finds it, the Mayor will be laughed out of office (and she’s the only one who approves his mint budget).
- **Vibe:** Funny, low-stakes, high embarrassment.

## 3. The Burn Book (The Teenage Angle)

- **The Hook:** A cheap, locked diary belonging to Sophia Doukas (the tile prodigy) is stolen from her beach bag.
- **The Backdrop Event:** **Midsummer School Break.** The beaches are crowded with youth.
- **The Mystery:** The diary contains a list of which town elders are having affairs and which "Tile Masters" are actually colorblind. If published, it causes a social civil war.
- **Why Cornelius Cares:** Sophia is hysteria in his lobby, and Zeph is emotionally compromised because he's in the book.
- **Vibe:** Gossip-heavy, fast-paced, "Teen Detective" energy mixed with dragon grumpiness.

## 4. The Knitting Pattern (The Cipher Angle)

- **The Hook:** A grandmother's notebook of knitting patterns for "Fisherman's Sweaters" is stolen.
- **The Backdrop Event:** **The First Storm of Summer.**
- **The Mystery:** To the coastal families, each sweater pattern is a family identifier. The thief stole it to "claim" a washed-up cargo crate that was marked with that family's sweater-pattern.
- **Why Cornelius Cares:** He respects the "code" aspect of knitting and the mathematical precision of the patterns.
- **Vibe:** Salty, stormy, intricate family rivalries.

## 5. The Estate Auction (The Acquisition)

- **The Hook:** A wealthy recluse dies, and his **"Bestiary of Lost Islands" (First Edition)** is up for auction. Cornelius _must_ have it.
- **The Backdrop Event:** **The Estate Auction.** Taking place in the town square.
- **The Mystery:** The Executor is knocked unconscious and the catalog is scrambled. The Constable freezes the auction. Cornelius must solve the assault so the auction can proceed before visiting collectors leave.
- **Why Cornelius Cares:** Pure selfishness. He wants that book.
- **Vibe:** Competitive, frantic, treasure-hunt.

## 6. The Author's Visit (The Celebrity Angle)

- **The Hook:** The world's most famous scholar arrives to sign _The Theory of Aether_, but refuses to sign anything.
- **The Backdrop Event:** **The Book Tour Gala.**
- **The Mystery:** The "Scholar" has been replaced by an impostor (or is being blackmailed). Cornelius notices the impostor isn't wearing his spectacles correctly.
- **Why Cornelius Cares:** He stood in line for 4 hours. He is not leaving without a signature.
- **Vibe:** Social satire, "locked room" feel (within the gala), identity theft.

## 7. The Birdwatcher's Log (The Alibi Angle)

- **The Hook:** A boring notebook listing pigeon sightings, belonging to the town bore, Mr. Pendelton, is stolen.
- **The Backdrop Event:** **The Migration Watch.**
- **The Mystery:** The thief isn't a bird enthusiast. They stole it because on page 42, Pendelton noted observing "A Rare Red-Crested Warbler" on a balcony... at the exact moment a crime was being committed there. The log is an accidental witness statement.
- **Why Cornelius Cares:** Pendelton is making a scene in the quiet zone.
- **Vibe:** Accidental detective work, humor, "Rear Window" vibes.
