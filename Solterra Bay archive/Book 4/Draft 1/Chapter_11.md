# Chapter 11

Cornelius returned to Melaina's statue and knelt beside it, his claws clicking against the stone floor with the particular rhythm that indicated methodical analysis rather than agitated pacing.

The lamplight flickered across grey stone that had been living flesh approximately one hour prior. Cornelius adjusted his spectacles and began a proper forensic examination of the transformation, comparing what he observed against his mental catalog of Demos's condition in the Temple Archives.

Details mattered. Differences indicated intent.

He started with the extremities. Melaina's hands rested in her lap with fingers loosely intertwined—natural positioning that suggested conscious arrangement rather than mid-gesture freezing. The stone texture was uniform across all surfaces, showing no variation between areas that had petrified from disease progression and areas transformed through deliberate magic.

Complete integration. Seamless transition. Professional execution.

Cornelius moved to examine her face. The features showed peaceful repose. Eyes closed. Lips slightly parted as though she had exhaled gently before the transformation completed. No tension in the jaw. No fear-widened eyes or defensive positioning.

She had not been surprised.

She had possibly been prepared.

He extended one claw and tapped gently against her shoulder, listening to the resonance. Solid. Dense. The particular acoustic quality of well-executed petrification without internal fractures or incomplete transformation.

Then he placed his palm flat against her chest and felt for the faint vibrations he had detected in Demos's statue—the subtle indication that biological processes continued beneath the stone.

Nothing.

Complete absence of internal activity. No heartbeat. No breath. No cellular function.

Absolute stasis.

Cornelius sat back on his haunches and reassessed. When he had examined Demos three days ago, the petrification had been incomplete. Biological function persisted beneath the surface—faint but present, like distant drumbeats through thick walls.

Demos had been caught mid-process. Interrupted. Partially transformed.

Melaina showed no such incompleteness.

This was finished work.

"Is she going to be okay?" Zeph's voice came from near Niko's statue, where he had been maintaining careful distance while Cornelius conducted his examination.

"That depends on multiple variables including reversal feasibility, biological integrity preservation during stasis, and whether the original caster survives long enough to attempt restoration." Cornelius stood and moved to examine Niko's petrified form. "But the transformation itself appears stable. No structural degradation. No indication of magical decay."

"That is not actually answering my question."

"Because I do not yet possess sufficient data to provide definitive answers." Cornelius circled Niko's statue, analyzing the same details he had cataloged for Melaina. Position. Expression. Surface uniformity. Acoustic resonance.

All identical. Same technique. Same signature. Same complete stasis without biological activity.

Professional medical intervention executed with surgical precision.

He inhaled deeply, activating scent analysis again. The sandalwood fragrance remained strong—concentrated around both statues but particularly intense near Melaina's position.

Fresh application within the last two hours. Possibly within the last hour based on dispersal patterns in the archive's controlled climate.

Photine had been here.

Had brought quarantine supplies.

Had transformed both patients using the same controlled petrification magic.

But why?

Cornelius returned to Melaina and examined her feet—the area where Zeph had reported progressive disease-based petrification advancing from toes upward.

The stone was seamless. No visible distinction between flesh-turned-stone and disease-progressed stone. The magical transformation had incorporated the existing petrification so completely that identifying the boundary required magical analysis rather than visual inspection.

Preservation through integration.

Like repairing damaged manuscript pages by encasing them in protective crystal that became part of the material itself rather than external containment.

The comparison assembled itself with uncomfortable clarity.

Cornelius had spent decades preserving fragile texts. He understood the principle of stabilizing deteriorating materials before they degraded beyond recovery. Sometimes preservation required dramatic intervention—removing pages from damaged bindings, treating them individually, reconstructing the whole from carefully maintained parts.

Photine had applied the same principle to living patients.

Melaina's disease was destroying her slowly, progressing from extremities inward. Standard treatments had failed. Experimental protocols proved ineffective. The deterioration continued despite all medical intervention.

So Photine had stabilized her.

Halted all biological processes before the disease could advance further.

Preserved her in perfect stasis while searching for actual treatment.

The logic was sound. Medically defensible. Possibly the only option available when facing progressive magical illness with no known cure.

Except it required transforming living people into stone with uncertain reversibility and no guarantee that biological function could be restored after extended stasis.

Cornelius's scales prickled with the particular discomfort that accompanied recognizing his own behavioral patterns in others.

He hoarded books to preserve knowledge.

Photine petrified patients to preserve lives.

Both represented desperate attempts to prevent permanent loss through whatever means available, regardless of social acceptability or institutional approval.

The parallel was deeply uncomfortable.

"You are thinking very loudly," Zeph said. He had moved closer, though still maintaining distance from the statues. "What did you figure out?"

"That Sister Photine is significantly more competent than I initially assessed. And significantly more desperate." Cornelius returned his attention to Melaina's peaceful stone face. "She executed this transformation with enough precision to preserve every detail. Complete biological suspension without internal damage or structural instability."

"So that is good, right? That means Melaina can be reversed safely?"

"It means the petrification itself was performed correctly. Whether safe reversal is possible depends on factors I cannot assess without understanding the underlying magical mechanics and Photine's specific technique." Cornelius adjusted his spectacles. "But the stability suggests deliberate medical procedure rather than panicked assault."

Zeph made a sound that suggested he was processing this information without enjoying the implications. "You keep saying 'medical procedure' like that makes turning people to stone okay."

"I am saying it was intentional preservation rather than criminal violence. The distinction matters when determining whether Photine should be arrested or consulted." Cornelius moved toward the archive stairs, his mind already calculating next steps. "We need to locate her immediately. She is the only person capable of reversing these transformations."

"Wait." Zeph's voice sharpened. "You said Melaina's petrification was stable. What about Demos? His transformation was stable too, right? You said we had about forty hours left before his condition became permanent."

Cornelius stopped walking.

The calculation assembled itself with terrible speed.

Demos's petrification had been different.

Partial rather than complete.

Biological vibrations still present beneath the stone.

Mid-gesture positioning suggesting interrupted transformation rather than prepared stasis.

And—most critically—Demos had not been a prepared patient.

He had not been positioned carefully.

Had not been treated with quarantine supplies first.

Had not been given whatever preparation Photine used before executing controlled petrification.

He had been an accident.

Or an emergency intervention.

Executed quickly rather than carefully.

Cornelius turned and moved back to Melaina's statue with renewed urgency. He placed his palm against her chest again, feeling for vibrations, then moved to Niko and repeated the process.

Both completely still. Absolute stasis. Perfect suspension.

No biological activity because the spell had been executed correctly—designed to halt all function rather than merely interrupt it.

But Demos—

Demos still had faint heartbeat. Faint breath. Biological processes continuing beneath incomplete petrification.

Which meant his transformation was unstable.

Which meant the magical stasis was imperfect.

Which meant biological degradation could continue despite the stone exterior.

Cornelius's claws clicked rapid patterns against the floor as the implications cascaded through his analysis.

Forty hours had been an estimate based on standard petrification reversal windows. The documented timeframe during which Gorgon-induced petrification remained reversible before becoming permanent.

But that estimate assumed stable transformation.

Complete magical suspension.

Proper execution of the spell.

Demos's petrification was none of those things.

His biological processes continued—which meant cellular activity continued, which meant metabolic function continued at whatever reduced rate the imperfect stasis allowed.

Which meant he was not preserved.

He was dying slowly.

Suffocating inside stone that prevented breathing but did not halt the body's need for oxygen.

Starving inside a shell that stopped eating but did not suspend metabolic requirements.

"Cornelius?" Zeph had moved closer. "You have that expression you get when you discover someone mis-shelved an entire section. Except worse."

"We have less time than I calculated." Cornelius moved toward the stairs with increased speed. "Significantly less time. Demos's transformation is degrading."

"What does that mean?"

"It means he is dying inside the petrification rather than being preserved by it." Cornelius took the stairs three at a time, wings half-spread for balance. "His biological processes continue at reduced capacity. Without oxygen. Without nutrients. Without any mechanism to remove metabolic waste."

Zeph's footsteps followed quickly. "How long does he have?"

"I do not know. Hours. Possibly less." Cornelius emerged into the library's main floor and oriented toward his study. "The forty-hour estimate assumed proper stasis. Demos's condition is systematically failing. We need Photine immediately."

"Where would she go? You said she was hiding."

"I said she was likely hiding or preparing for next steps." Cornelius entered his study and grabbed the satchel containing Demos's ledger. "But Mother Ligeia sent a message saying 'Tell the Healer. She knows what must be done but fears the cost.' Which suggests Ligeia knew about the planned petrifications and possibly coordinated timing with Photine."

"So Photine might be at the Enclave?"

"Or Ligeia knows where she went after transforming Melaina and Niko." Cornelius paused at his desk, looking at the scattered notes and inventory records documenting his investigation. Three days of careful analysis. Methodical elimination of suspects. Professional forensic examination.

All rendered irrelevant by the simple fact that they were no longer investigating assault.

They were attempting rescue.

"I need you to remain here," Cornelius said. "Monitor the archive. If Watch arrives with inspection orders, deny them entry and send for Imelda immediately. She has sufficient institutional authority to delay Captain Theo if he attempts forced access."

"You are going to the Enclave alone?"

"I am going wherever Mother Ligeia directs me to find Photine. The Enclave is merely the starting location." Cornelius moved toward the window he used for aerial departures. "Ligeia trusted me with Melaina's protection. She will trust me with information about Photine's location if I explain the urgency."

"What if she does not know where Photine is?"

"Then I will expand search parameters based on available data regarding Photine's known locations, professional obligations, and likely hiding places." Cornelius opened the window. Cool night air carried the distant sounds of the city conducting pre-dawn routines—Watch shift changes, early market preparations, the particular quiet that preceded sunrise activity.

Somewhere in that layered urban complexity, Sister Photine was hiding or planning or possibly attempting to reverse transformations on her own without support or resources.

And Brother Demos was dying inside imperfect stone.

"Cornelius." Zeph's voice was smaller than usual. "What if you cannot find her in time?"

The question hung between them like physical weight.

Cornelius looked back at his assistant. Sixteen years old. Tired. Frightened. Trying to maintain composure while their investigation shifted from intellectual puzzle to desperate race against biological decay.

"Then I will have failed both Demos and Melaina," Cornelius said quietly. "And Captain Theo will arrest Photine for multiple murders instead of consulting her for advanced magical medicine. And three people will remain stone permanently because we categorized treatment as assault."

"That is not comforting."

"I am not attempting comfort. I am stating probable outcomes to clarify stakes." Cornelius positioned himself at the window. "Which is why I must locate Photine before dawn, convince her to return despite certain criminal prosecution, and persuade her to reverse Demos's unstable petrification before his biological integrity collapses completely."

"While also somehow preventing the Watch from arresting her the moment she appears."

"Correct."

"That seems impossible."

"It seems improbable. Impossible would require circumstances that preclude any potential solution regardless of resource application." Cornelius spread his wings. "We have resources. We have limited time. We have motivation. Therefore the problem remains solvable even if probability calculations suggest unfavorable outcomes."

Zeph made a sound that might have been a laugh or might have been exhaustion expressing itself through inappropriate humor. "You are saying we might fail but we should try anyway."

"I am saying failure is unacceptable despite being statistically likely. Therefore we will attempt success through whatever means prove necessary." Cornelius paused at the window opening. "Including theft, obstruction of legal investigations, and harboring fugitives from Watch detention."

"So basically we are already criminals and might as well commit additional crimes if they help save people."

"That is an oversimplification. But functionally accurate."

The library stretched quiet behind them. Stone walls and careful shelving and the accumulated knowledge of centuries organized according to systems Cornelius himself had implemented. Safe. Ordered. Predictable.

Everything the current situation was not.

Cornelius thought of his hidden hoard. The rare volumes he had concealed from Imelda's donation requirements. The precious texts he had protected from the charity sale despite knowing the Temple needed funding for medical supplies.

Books he had valued more than human lives.

Until confronting the reality of those lives—Demos bankrupting himself to provide charity care, Photine destroying her career to preserve dying patients, Melaina slowly transforming to stone while healers refused treatment she could not afford.

His hoard seemed increasingly indefensible.

Not because books lacked value.

But because he had treated their preservation as more important than people's survival.

"When I return," Cornelius said, "remind me to compile a complete catalog of my private collection for immediate sale. All proceeds to Temple medical funding."

Zeph blinked. "All of it? Even the books you hid from Imelda?"

"Especially those books. They represent the highest value and therefore generate the most funding for supplies." Cornelius adjusted his spectacles. "Demos spent everything to save people. I can at least spend my hoard to honor that sacrifice."

"That is—" Zeph stopped. Started again. "That is probably the least dragon-like thing I have ever heard you say."

"Demos was not a dragon. He had no instinct for hoarding or territorial preservation. Yet he managed superior resource allocation through systematic sacrifice of personal stability." Cornelius looked out at the pre-dawn city. "I am merely applying his methodology to my own excessive accumulation."

"You know he would probably tell you the books matter too. That knowledge preservation serves people even if the help is not immediate."

"Perhaps. But he is currently unavailable for consultation due to being petrified inside unstable stone while I waste time justifying past hoarding behavior." Cornelius launched himself from the window. "Secure the archive. Deny all entry. I will return with Photine or information about her location."

He did not wait for Zeph's response. The night air caught his wings and lifted him above the library's dome, above the civic quarter's organized stone architecture, toward the residential districts and eventually the old cistern system where the Gorgon Enclave maintained its hidden community.

Below him, the city continued its pre-dawn routines. Watch patrols marking territory. Early merchants preparing market stalls. The mechanical function of urban life proceeding according to established patterns.

While three people remained frozen in stone.

While one of them slowly died from the inside.

While the healer capable of reversing their conditions hid from the same authorities who should have been protecting her expertise.

Cornelius angled toward the cistern district and increased his speed.

Forty hours had been the estimate.

But Demos likely had significantly less.

And every minute Cornelius spent searching was one minute closer to permanent biological failure.

Human bodies were terribly fragile when subjected to magical stasis designed for different purposes. Imperfect preservation created imperfect outcomes. The longer Demos remained partly-petrified, the more damage accumulated from interrupted biological processes trying to function without proper resources.

Like trying to preserve a manuscript by coating it with wax while the pages continued absorbing moisture and breeding mold beneath the protective layer.

Eventually the preservation itself became destruction.

Cornelius descended toward the Enclave's primary entrance—a concealed passage behind a collapsed warehouse that led into the deeper cistern network. Guards would be posted. Security would be heightened during Watch enforcement of the registration protocols.

But Mother Ligeia had trusted him with Melaina.

She would trust him with this.

She had to.

Because the alternative was watching three people die while their would-be savior hid from authorities too rigid to distinguish medicine from murder.

Human inefficiency was going to kill them all.

Unless Cornelius located Photine first.

He landed at the warehouse entry and folded his wings.

Time to see if Mother Ligeia's trust extended to resurrection as well as preservation.
