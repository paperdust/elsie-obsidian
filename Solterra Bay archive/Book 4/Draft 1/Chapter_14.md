# Chapter 14

The Eel & Tankard smelled of anise and desperation.

Cornelius perched on a bench that wobbled when he settled his weight, the satchel containing his most precious possession resting against his side. The tavern occupied the worst corner of the harbor district—a building battered by decades of sea spray, its timbers dark with moisture and neglect. Oil lamps burned low despite the noon hour, casting uncertain light across tables scarred by knife-marks and spilled drinks.

This was not the sort of establishment that appeared in respectable commercial directories.

Which made it exactly the sort of place where transactions requiring discretion occurred without excessive documentation.

Cornelius adjusted his spectacles and surveyed the interior with the same analytical precision he applied to cataloging damaged manuscripts. Three tables occupied by dock workers consuming bowls of fish stew that smelled aggressively of garlic. A bartender polishing glasses with a cloth that appeared less clean than the glasses themselves. A back corner booth draped with a privacy curtain that suggested regular use for unofficial business.

The curtain twitched.

A figure emerged—tall, human, dressed in expensive but understated clothing that managed to look both prosperous and forgettable. Lord Vane. Not his actual title, Cornelius suspected, but rather an affectation adopted for exactly these sorts of meetings.

The collector approached with the careful movements of someone accustomed to operating in spaces where Watch presence was minimal and violence remained a commercial possibility.

"You brought it?" His voice matched his appearance—cultured but deliberately neutral.

Cornelius placed one claw on the satchel. "I brought verification materials and the item itself. Marcus Varen indicated you required immediate authentication before finalizing purchase terms."

"Marcus said you were in a hurry." Lord Vane settled onto the opposite bench without invitation. "Hurried sales usually mean stolen goods or desperate sellers. Which are you?"

"I am a Library Dragon liquidating personal assets to fund time-sensitive charitable works." Cornelius kept his tone level despite his scales prickling with irritation at the implication of theft. "The provenance is impeccable. The item has been in my private collection for one hundred and seven years. I acquired it through legitimate estate auction with full documentation."

"But you are not providing that documentation now."

"I am providing my personal certification as an expert in historical manuscripts and my professional reputation as curator of the city's largest archival collection." Cornelius lifted the satchel onto the table. "If my verification is insufficient, we can terminate negotiations and I will pursue alternative buyers."

Lord Vane's expression did not change, but his hands moved with increased interest toward the satchel. "Show me."

Cornelius unwrapped the protective cloth with careful claws. The Chronicles of the Founding emerged in layers—first the leather binding, then the gold leaf spine, finally the full magnificence of the Founder's annotated first edition.

The book seemed to absorb lamplight rather than reflect it. Pages thick with age and careful preservation. Margins dense with handwritten notes in the Founder's distinctive script. Illuminated capitals still bright with pigments that cost more than most families earned in lifetimes.

Lord Vane reached toward it, then paused. "May I?"

"You may examine it carefully. The binding is sound but the pages require gentle handling." Cornelius watched as the collector lifted the book with the particular reverence that indicated genuine scholarship rather than simple acquisition.

Lord Vane opened to a random page. Read the printed text. Read the marginal annotations. Looked up at Cornelius with an expression that suggested he had expected something valuable but not something this valuable.

"This is authentic."

"Obviously."

"The marginalia—these are the Founder's actual strategic notes. Commentary on the campaign recordkeeping methods. Criticism of the original chronicler's bias regarding the mountain campaigns." Lord Vane turned pages with increasing care. "I have read published excerpts of these annotations but I thought the original manuscript was lost."

"It was believed lost because I did not advertise its presence in my collection." Cornelius kept his voice steady despite the uncomfortable sensation spreading through his chest. Watching someone else handle his most precious volume felt like allowing a stranger to examine his internal organs. "I preferred to maintain discretionary ownership rather than deal with institutional acquisition demands."

"Smart." Lord Vane continued his examination. "The illumination is original. No restoration work. Binding is period-appropriate. The paper shows characteristic aging patterns consistent with the documented publication date." He looked up. "This is worth significantly more than the twenty-five hundred Marcus mentioned."

"I am aware." Cornelius folded his wings tight against his sides—the physical equivalent of steadying himself. "However, I require liquid currency within the next fifteen minutes rather than optimal auction pricing over several months. Therefore I am willing to accept below-market rates in exchange for immediate gold payment and minimal transaction documentation."

Lord Vane set the book down carefully. "How much do you actually need?"

The question was more direct than Cornelius had anticipated. He recalculated his approach. This was a negotiation, and negotiations required accurate assessment of counterpart motivations.

Lord Vane was a collector who had just been offered something he likely never expected to acquire.

Collectors operating in black markets prided themselves on securing items other buyers could not access.

This book represented a significant addition to any serious collection—and the opportunity to purchase it would not recur.

"I require five hundred gold crowns," Cornelius said. "Standard weight. Immediately negotiable currency accepted at harbor businesses and by professional smugglers."

Lord Vane's eyebrows rose. "That is substantially less than this book's worth."

"I am aware. But I am not conducting a standard commercial transaction. I am converting a non-portable asset into immediate working capital under severe time constraints." Cornelius kept his claws visible on the table—showing he was not reaching for weapons or attempting concealment. "I need gold. You want the book. We can complete our business and part ways within five minutes."

"Or I could offer you eight hundred and you could fund your charitable works more completely."

Cornelius paused. His analytical mind immediately calculated implications. Eight hundred gold crowns was closer to actual auction value for a volume this rare. It would cover not just Photine's passage but also medical supplies, potential bribes, emergency contingencies.

It would also delay the transaction while Lord Vane arranged for that much additional currency.

"How quickly can you produce eight hundred crowns?" Cornelius asked.

"I carry three hundred in my secured case. The rest I can have delivered here within thirty minutes."

Thirty minutes exceeded their time margin. The Constant Stanza departed at fifth bell. Zeph was currently attempting to locate and delay a smuggler vessel using nothing but adolescent determination and questionable judgment.

Cornelius needed to reach the docks immediately, not wait for delayed payment.

"Five hundred," he repeated. "Available now. Non-negotiable timeline."

Lord Vane studied him for a long moment. Then nodded slowly. "You are actually trying to save someone. This is not business. This is personal."

"My motivations are irrelevant to our transaction."

"They are relevant to whether I respect you enough to provide fair value despite your desperation." Lord Vane reached into his jacket and withdrew a leather case. "I will give you six hundred. Three hundred now in coin. Three hundred more in a letter of credit accepted by Marcus Varen and two other dealers I know you have worked with previously. You can convert that to physical gold within an hour at any of their establishments."

Cornelius's scales stopped their uncomfortable prickling. Six hundred crowns. Enough to secure passage, bribe dock officials if necessary, and maintain emergency reserves.

And Lord Vane was offering fair value when he could have exploited the time pressure to demand the book for half that amount.

"Why?" Cornelius asked.

"Because I collect beautiful things and you are destroying yourself to save someone." Lord Vane opened his case and began counting coins onto the table. "I appreciate beauty but I understand priorities. Take the six hundred. Save whoever needs saving. And know the Chronicles will be preserved properly."

The coins accumulated in neat stacks. Heavy gold crowns, each stamped with the city's harbor seal. Legitimate currency accepted throughout the commercial districts.

Cornelius watched his hoard convert into portable assets.

The sensation should have been devastating. He had protected this book for more than a century. Had kept it hidden from institutional demands and civic emergencies. Had sworn never to sell it regardless of circumstances.

Now he was trading it for gold to fund the escape of a Temple healer who had petrified three people.

The equation should have felt wrong.

Instead, it felt like shedding uncomfortable weight.

Lord Vane finished counting and produced a letter of credit from his case. "Three hundred in coin. Three hundred in verified letter. Marcus will confirm the signature." He pushed both toward Cornelius. "Do we have agreement?"

Cornelius looked at the gold. Looked at the book. Looked at Lord Vane's expression, which showed genuine respect rather than predatory satisfaction.

"We have agreement." Cornelius transferred the coins into his satchel with careful claws. The weight settled satisfyingly—heavy enough to represent real value, portable enough to transport quickly. "The book is yours."

Lord Vane wrapped it carefully in the protective cloth and secured it in his own carrying case. "I will preserve it properly. Climate-controlled storage. Minimal handling. It will outlast both of us."

"That is all preservation requires." Cornelius stood, the satchel secured against his side. "Thank you for fair dealing despite my compromised negotiating position."

"Thank you for trusting me with something you clearly valued." Lord Vane remained seated, his case resting on the bench beside him. "Good luck with your rescue operation."

Cornelius turned toward the door.

Paused.

Looked back at the collector holding his most precious possession.

"The Founder's note on page forty-seven," Cornelius said quietly. "About the importance of knowing when to spend resources rather than hoard them. Read that section when you have time."

Lord Vane's expression showed surprise. "I will."

Cornelius left the Eel & Tankard and emerged into the harbor district's noise and activity. The weight in his satchel pulled different than the weight of the book had. Less precious. More useful.

He had sold his hoard.

And the city had not collapsed.

His collection had not lost meaning.

The library would not fall into chaos.

He had simply converted one form of value into another—and this form could save actual lives instead of sitting in climate-controlled storage beneath his roost.

The realization settled with unexpected clarity.

Preservation was not the same as hoarding.

Sometimes preserving what mattered required spending what you valued.

Cornelius spread his wings and launched himself toward the Temple district. He needed to collect Imelda and proceed to the harbor. Zeph would be attempting to delay smugglers with nothing but desperate creativity. Photine would be stranded somewhere trying to negotiate passage she could not afford.

And Demos remained dying inside unstable stone with perhaps hours remaining before biological degradation became irreversible.

The gold in Cornelius's satchel represented their margin between salvation and permanent loss.

He flew faster.

—

The Temple's administrative wing was quieter than Cornelius had ever experienced it. He landed in the courtyard and folded his wings, the satchel's weight a constant reminder of his transaction's success and cost.

Imelda's office occupied the second floor—a workspace she had maintained since becoming the Temple's primary liaison for medical supply documentation. During previous visits, the space had bustled with junior administrators managing inventory logs and procurement schedules.

Now the outer office stood empty.

Cornelius moved through deserted corridors toward Imelda's private workspace. The door was closed, which was unusual. Imelda preferred accessibility and maintained open-door policies during working hours.

He knocked carefully with one claw.

No response.

He knocked again.

A sound emerged from inside. Not words. Something that might have been breathing except it carried too much weight. Too much grief.

Cornelius opened the door.

Imelda sat at her desk with her face in her hands, shoulders shaking with the particular rhythm that indicated sustained crying. Papers were scattered across the desktop in unusual disorder. Her ink-stained fingers pressed against her temples as though physically holding herself together.

Cornelius had never seen her cry.

In one hundred and twenty-seven years, he had never witnessed Imelda Kassiani lose composure.

"Imelda." He closed the door behind himself and moved closer. "What has happened? Is someone else petrified? Has the Watch escalated enforcement actions?"

She looked up. Her face showed tear-tracks and the particular redness that indicated extended weeping rather than momentary distress.

"I found his financial records." Her voice was rough, broken by the kind of crying that hurt the throat. "Demos's actual personal finances. Not the Temple ledger. His private accounts."

Cornelius set the satchel on a clear section of desk and waited. Sometimes silence provided better support than words.

Imelda pulled one of the scattered papers toward her. "He sold everything. His furniture. His books. The family jewelry his mother left him. His winter cloak." She touched the paper with one shaking finger. "He sold his burial plot."

The words took a moment to register.

Burial plots in the city's memorial gardens cost substantial sums. They represented family legacy and social status. They provided eternal rest in maintained, consecrated ground rather than anonymous interment in common fields.

Most people acquired burial plots decades before death—securing permanent resting places while still healthy and financially stable.

Demos had been twenty-eight years old.

He should have owned his plot for years.

And he had sold it.

"When?" Cornelius asked quietly.

"Three months ago. The same week the fever cases started appearing in the Gorgon Quarter." Imelda's voice broke again. "He sold his own grave to buy medicine for people who could not pay. Who the Temple refused to treat because they lacked funds or proper documentation or—"

She could not finish the sentence.

Cornelius understood.

Demos had sold the guarantee of his own eternal rest to provide temporary relief for people the institutions had already written off as acceptable losses.

He had spent literally everything—including his eventual death—to preserve lives now.

"I taught him preservation principles," Imelda said. Her hands were shaking again. "When he started as junior healer, I supervised his inventory management training. I taught him about resource allocation and sustainable distribution and long-term institutional stability. And he learned all of it and then ignored every principle because people were dying and he could not—he could not—"

Her voice broke completely.

Cornelius climbed onto the desk and sat beside the scattered papers. His analytical mind wanted to catalog the financial records, to understand exactly what Demos had sacrificed and when. But his emotional awareness recognized that Imelda did not need investigation.

She needed someone to acknowledge that her student had been better than his teachers.

"You taught him preservation," Cornelius said carefully. "He understood the lesson. He simply applied it to people rather than resources."

"He had nothing left." Imelda pressed her ink-stained hands against her face again. "When they find his body—when the reversal fails or when we are too late or when—he will not even have a grave. They will put him in common ground with criminals and paupers and—"

"We are not going to be too late." Cornelius nudged the satchel toward her with one claw. "I sold the Chronicles. Six hundred gold crowns. Enough to secure Photine's passage and cooperation. Enough to bribe dock officials if necessary. Enough to fund the reversal procedure and any emergency medical intervention Demos requires afterward."

Imelda looked up. Her expression showed shock beneath the grief. "You sold the Chronicles? Your Chronicles? The Founder's annotated edition you swore you would never—"

"I sold it to someone who will preserve it properly while I use the proceeds to preserve something more important." Cornelius adjusted his spectacles. "Demos spent his burial plot on fever medicine. I spent my hoard on his survival. The mathematics seem appropriate."

Imelda stared at him for a long moment. Then she started crying again—but different this time. Less grief. More complicated emotions that included gratitude and pride and exhaustion and hope.

She reached out and rested one ink-stained hand on Cornelius's head, the same gesture she had used when he was a hatchling and needed comfort.

"You are growing up," she said quietly. "Finally. After only one hundred and twenty-seven years."

"I am adapting my resource management principles to accommodate new priorities." But Cornelius did not pull away from her hand. "We should proceed to the harbor. Zeph is currently attempting to delay professional smugglers without adult supervision or adequate planning."

"How much time do we have?"

Cornelius calculated rapidly. His transaction with Lord Vane had consumed approximately twenty minutes. Transit time to the Temple had taken another ten. Current time was approximately thirty-eight minutes past the hour before fifth bell.

"Twenty-two minutes before the Constant Stanza departs," he said. "Possibly less if the captain decides early departure is safer than adhering to schedule."

Imelda stood and collected the financial records into organized stacks with practiced efficiency despite her emotional state. She secured them in a desk drawer and locked it with hands that had stopped shaking.

"Then we go," she said. "We find Photine. We save Demos. And we make sure that boy gets a proper burial plot when he dies of old age in sixty years rather than next week inside stone."

Cornelius picked up the satchel. The gold crowns clinked softly with realistic weight.

"He will not need a grave," he said. "Because we are not going to let him die."

Imelda looked at him with an expression that mixed hope and pain. "You cannot promise that."

"No. But I can promise we will spend everything trying. Which appears to be the lesson Demos was attempting to teach." Cornelius moved toward the door. "Are you capable of flight? We can reach the harbor faster if you ride rather than run."

"I have not ridden a dragon in eighty years."

"Then you are overdue for refresher experience." Cornelius exited the office and moved toward the courtyard exit. Behind him, Imelda followed with the particular determined pace that indicated she had converted grief into action.

They emerged into the courtyard together. Cornelius crouched to allow her to mount between his wings. She settled with practiced balance, her weight familiar despite the decades since she had last needed aerial transport.

"Hold securely," Cornelius said. "I am going to fly faster than is strictly advisable given civilian passenger safety protocols."

"I helped raise you from an egg. I am aware of your tendency toward dramatic velocity." Imelda's hands gripped the ridge of scales along his spine. "Go."

Cornelius launched himself upward with enough force to clear the courtyard walls in a single leap. The city spread beneath them—stone buildings and civic architecture and the distant harbor where desperate people waited for ships that promised escape.

The satchel bounced against his side with every wing-stroke.

Six hundred gold crowns.

The price of his hoard.

The cost of preservation.

The weight of choosing people over books after spending a century choosing books over people.

Cornelius angled toward the harbor and increased his speed.

Behind him, Imelda held on and possibly started crying again—or possibly just pressed her face against his scales and allowed wind to blur tears she could not afford to acknowledge while time ran out.

Below them, the city continued its normal functions, unaware that in approximately twenty minutes, a smuggler ship would attempt to depart carrying a fugitive healer who represented their only chance of reversing three separate petrifications before permanence set in.

Cornelius flew faster.

The chase was not finished.

But at least now they had resources.

Human problems, he reflected, required human solutions.

Sometimes that meant selling your hoard.

Sometimes that meant selling your grave.

Sometimes preservation required destroying the things you had spent lifetimes protecting.

The harbor rushed closer.

Cornelius did not slow down.
