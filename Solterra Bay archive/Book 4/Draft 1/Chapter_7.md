# Chapter 7

"I require access to Mother Ligeia."

The Gorgon standing guard at the cistern entrance did not move. He was young—perhaps twenty—with serpent hair that coiled and uncoiled in patterns suggesting agitation rather than threat. His hand rested on a weighted club that had clearly seen recent sharpening.

"The Enclave is closed," he said. His voice carried the careful neutrality of someone delivering a memorized response. "Mother Ligeia is not receiving visitors."

Cornelius adjusted his spectacles and reassessed the entrance configuration. The cisterns occupied the oldest section of the city's water infrastructure—a network of stone tunnels and chambers that predated current street layouts by at least three centuries. The entrance descended through what appeared to be a abandoned wine merchant's cellar, the original purpose obscured by time and strategic Gorgon occupancy.

Two additional guards flanked the main passage, both armed. Their positioning suggested defensive preparation rather than casual security.

The roundup had clearly accelerated community fortification.

"I am investigating the assault on Brother Demos," Cornelius said. "Mother Ligeia possesses information relevant to the case. Her cooperation would be appreciated."

"The Enclave is closed to outside investigation." The young guard's serpent hair tightened around his shoulders. "We are managing our own security."

"By barricading against civic authority and preparing for armed confrontation?"

"By protecting our people from illegal detention protocols." The guard's expression hardened. "You want to question someone, take it up with Captain Theo. He seems eager to interrogate Gorgons."

Valid point. Theo's registration mandate had effectively positioned the Watch as adversary rather than protection. Any Gorgon cooperation with external investigators would be interpreted as collaboration with oppression.

Cornelius tried a different approach. "I am not Watch. I am not enforcing roundup protocols. I am attempting to restore Brother Demos—a healer who spent his final conscious hours treating Enclave residents without compensation."

The guard's posture shifted slightly. Not quite relaxation. More like recognition of complexity.

"Mother Ligeia knows this," he said finally. "She also knows that good intentions do not prevent bad outcomes. The Enclave stays closed until we determine our own safety." He gestured toward the passage behind him. "I can deliver a message if you have official business."

"My business is with Mother Ligeia directly."

"Then your business remains unfinished."

Cornelius considered forcing the issue. He was significantly larger than any of the guards and possessed both flight capacity and physical advantages inherent to draconic species. Pushing past them would be trivial from a purely mechanical standpoint.

It would also constitute assault, confirm every prejudice about predatory mythkin, and guarantee that the Enclave would never cooperate with any future inquiry.

He was calculating alternative strategies when movement deeper in the passage caught his attention.

A figure emerged from the shadows—tall, thin, moving with the particular careful grace of someone navigating memorized space without visual reference.

Mother Ligeia.

She wore simple grey robes that blended with the stone walls. Her serpent hair moved in slow, coordinated patterns, compensating for her blindness through motion-sensing and air displacement reading. Her face showed age through expression rather than deterioration—the kind of weathering that came from decades of leadership and impossible choices.

"Cornelius Drake." Her voice carried the texture of worn stone. "The dragon who preserves everything except common sense."

The young guard stepped aside immediately. Cornelius noted the absolute deference in the movement. Ligeia commanded loyalty that transcended simple respect.

"Mother Ligeia. I appreciate your willingness to speak with me."

"I did not say I was willing. I said I was present." She moved forward until she stood directly between Cornelius and the passage entrance. "You come to my home demanding access while your Council organizes roundups. You investigate assault while my people prepare for siege. Tell me, Librarian—do you practice such irony deliberately, or does it come naturally to your species?"

"I am not responsible for Council emergency protocols."

"Yet you benefit from them. You operate in their civic quarter, maintain their records, receive their institutional protections." Her serpent hair oriented toward him with unsettling precision. "You exist comfortably within systems of power and then claim neutrality when those systems turn violent."

Cornelius's tail curled against the stone floor. The accusation struck uncomfortably close to observations Imelda had made regarding his controlled distance from community suffering.

"I am attempting to prevent further violence by identifying the actual perpetrator rather than enabling collective punishment."

"How noble. The dragon defends us with investigation." Ligeia's expression remained neutral, but her serpent hair's movements suggested contempt. "Meanwhile, your Captain Theo sharpens his detention procedures and my children prepare weapons they should not need to own."

"Which is precisely why I require information about—"

"The Flower." Ligeia tilted her head. "You came seeking the Flower. Yes, I know. Information travels quickly in enclosed spaces." She smiled without humor. "But flowers require specific conditions to survive. Too much exposure kills as surely as drought. You understand preservation, Cornelius Drake. Surely you understand protection."

He did understand. He also understood that Melaina was currently hidden in his archive rather than the Enclave, which meant Ligeia's protective metaphors were defending empty space.

Unless there was another Flower. Another sick Gorgon the Enclave was sheltering.

"I need to know who Brother Demos treated in the days before his petrification," Cornelius said carefully. "Particularly anyone suffering from persistent fever resistant to standard remedies."

"Why?"

"Because Demos was investigating unusual fever patterns. Because his treatment network included Enclave residents. Because understanding his final cases may illuminate who attacked him and why."

Ligeia's serpent hair coiled tighter. "Or it may expose vulnerable people to Watch scrutiny and force them into registration protocols designed to control rather than protect."

"I am not sharing information with the Watch."

"You are not sharing information with anyone. Including me." She moved closer, her blindness not impeding her ability to position herself directly in Cornelius's sight line. "You come asking questions but offer no answers. You demand trust while harboring your own secrets. What are you protecting, Cornelius Drake? What have you hidden in your precious library that you would risk coming here while the Council sharpens its knives?"

His scales prickled. She could not possibly know about Melaina. Niko had brought the girl directly to the library under cover of darkness and Zeph's impersonation. No one had witnessed—

Except Ligeia commanded an intelligence network that had identified Cornelius as a potential ally before he had even made that determination himself. Information traveled quickly in enclosed spaces. And shapeshifters reported to someone.

"I am protecting investigation integrity," Cornelius said. "Which requires understanding the full scope of Demos's treatment activities."

"The full scope is that he cared when others did not. He treated fever, injury, infection—whatever presented itself. He did not maintain detailed records of unauthorized charity work because detailed records create evidence trails." Ligeia's expression hardened. "He protected his patients through obscurity. I will not undo that protection to satisfy your curiosity."

"Even if that obscurity enables whoever attacked him to remain unidentified?"

"Even then." She turned partially away, indicating dismissal. "The roots matter more than individual branches. I will not sacrifice the whole network to avenge one person, no matter how valued."

Footsteps echoed from the passage behind Ligeia. Cornelius looked past her and saw another figure approaching—this one carrying what appeared to be a canvas supply bag.

Kyra Kallistos.

She emerged from the deeper tunnels with the confident stride of someone navigating familiar territory. The bag she carried showed the distinctive green seal of the Temple's charity distribution program. Her expression shifted through surprise, calculation, and something resembling resignation when she saw Cornelius.

"Mother Ligeia." Kyra's tone carried careful respect. "I brought the supplies you requested. Bandages, fever treatments, dried—"

"I did not request supplies." Ligeia's voice remained pleasant, but her serpent hair oriented toward Kyra with unmistakable hostility. "I requested that you stop attempting to purchase absolution through charity donations."

Kyra stopped walking. "I am helping."

"You are performing. There is a difference." Ligeia moved toward her, somehow navigating the uneven stone floor without hesitation. "You bring Temple supplies to demonstrate civic connection. You deliver charity to prove worthiness. You perform compassion as though it were currency that could buy back what you have already sold."

"I have not—"

"You sold your reflection, Kyra Kallistos. You sold your face and your serpent hair and your truth." Ligeia's voice remained quiet, which somehow made it more devastating. "You trade authenticity for acceptance at whatever Temple altar currently offers the best price for your disguise. Do not come here pretending that bag of bandages restores what you have already abandoned."

Kyra's composure cracked. "I am still Gorgon. I am still—"

"You are whatever your current mirror shows you. Which changes depending on audience and advantage." Ligeia gestured toward the passage exit. "Take your supplies to whoever you are pretending to be this week. The Enclave does not accept charity from those who reject community except when it serves their reputation."

"The roundup affects me too. I still have to register. I still—"

"You will register as Gorgon to maintain legal status while passing as human to maintain social status. You will leverage both identities strategically while committing to neither authentically." Ligeia's serpent hair spread wide, creating a physical barrier between Kyra and the deeper tunnels. "You are not welcome here. Not your supplies. Not your performance. Not your carefully calculated gesture toward belonging."

Kyra stood motionless for several seconds. Her expression cycled through anger, shame, and something that looked uncomfortably like grief. Then she turned and walked toward the exit without responding.

She passed within three feet of Cornelius. Her eyes met his briefly. He saw exhaustion there. And recognition of someone else navigating between communities without full acceptance from either.

Then she was gone, footsteps echoing up the stone passage toward the cellar exit.

Ligeia waited until the sound faded completely before speaking. "You see? This is what your investigation protects. People who exploit crisis for personal advantage while abandoning collective responsibility."

"I was not investigating Kyra Kallistos."

"Perhaps you should. She visited Sister Photine three times in the past two weeks. Always at odd hours. Always alone." Ligeia's serpent hair resumed its slow scanning pattern. "But that would require questioning someone connected to the Three Families. Easier to interrogate Enclave residents who lack institutional protection."

Cornelius filed the Photine-Kyra connection for future analysis. "I interrogate whoever possesses relevant information regardless of social status."

"How admirably egalitarian. Tell me, does that principle apply to yourself?" Ligeia moved back toward the deeper passage. "Or do you maintain different standards for librarians harboring fugitives in climate-controlled archives?"

The accusation landed like a physical blow.

Cornelius went absolutely still. "I do not know what you mean."

"Of course not. Just like I do not know that Niko brought Melaina to your library last night. Just like I do not know that you are currently hiding her in the same secret room where you hoard banned texts and irreplaceable manuscripts." Ligeia smiled. "We are both protecting flowers, Cornelius Drake. The difference is that I admit it."

The silence stretched between them. The young guard near the entrance shifted uncomfortably but did not intervene.

Cornelius calculated his options. Denial was clearly futile. Ligeia's intelligence network exceeded his initial assessment. Attempting to negotiate might expose additional vulnerabilities.

He chose oblique honesty.

"If I were harboring someone," Cornelius said carefully, "it would be because they required immediate medical intervention unavailable through official channels."

"If I were directing someone to seek such harbor," Ligeia replied, "it would be because remaining in the Enclave exposed them to danger from multiple directions. Including well-intentioned investigators who might inadvertently reveal their location to authorities conducting species-based roundups."

They regarded each other across the dim passage. A negotiation conducted through conditional hypotheticals and strategic omission.

"The person you are not discussing," Cornelius continued, "would require specific medical treatment for progressive fever conditions. Understanding the source and nature of that illness might prevent additional cases."

"Or it might expose a pattern that certain powerful interests wish to remain hidden. Particularly if that pattern implicates Temple operations or Three Families politics." Ligeia's expression remained neutral. "Some investigations threaten roots more than individual branches."

"Meaning you believe Demos was attacked because of what he discovered. Not because of random criminal opportunity."

"Meaning I believe systems protect themselves when threatened with exposure. Medical systems. Economic systems. Power systems." She turned back toward the deeper tunnels. "Your hypothetical patient remains safer in deep archives than in shallow graves. Keep her hidden, Cornelius Drake. And stop asking questions that put targets on vulnerable backs."

She began walking away. Cornelius watched her navigate the passage with absolute confidence despite her blindness.

"Mother Ligeia. One more question."

She paused but did not turn around.

"Do you know who petrified Brother Demos?"

"I know who benefits from his silence. I know who profits from Gorgon scapegoating. I know who controls medical access and resource distribution." Her serpent hair coiled tight against her shoulders. "But knowing and proving are different categories. You taught me that yourself, years ago, when explaining why certain historical documents remain archived rather than publicly displayed."

She disappeared into the darkness, leaving Cornelius alone with the guards and his own uncomfortable recognition.

He had indeed taught that principle. Knowledge without actionable proof created danger rather than justice. Some truths remained archived precisely because exposing them would cause more harm than their concealment.

He was still processing implications when one of the guards coughed diplomatically.

"You should leave," the young man said. Not hostile. Almost sympathetic. "Mother Ligeia gave you what she could. Pressing for more helps no one."

Cornelius nodded and turned toward the exit passage. The stone walls pressed close, the air thick with moisture and the particular scent of ancient lichen growth. Behind him, he heard the guards resuming their defensive positions.

He was halfway up the passage when another figure emerged from a side chamber—this one he had not noticed during his entrance.

Xanthe.

She sat on a stone ledge, sharpening a blade across a whetstone with methodical precision. The scraping sound echoed off the walls. She did not look up when Cornelius stopped.

"Leaving so soon?" She tested the blade's edge against her thumb. "I thought librarians were persistent. All that research training."

"I obtained the information I required."

"Did you?" She set down the knife and picked up something longer. A short spear, the point already gleaming. "Or did you just confirm that we are preparing for war while you maintain comfortable neutrality?"

"I am investigating assault, not choosing sides in political conflict."

"Everything is political conflict. Medical triage is political. Resource distribution is political. Deciding whose petrification merits investigation versus whose suffering merits dismissal—extremely political." She resumed sharpening, the blade scraping against stone in steady rhythm. "You investigated Demos's assault immediately. How long did the Watch wait before investigating attacks on Gorgons last year? Three weeks? Four?"

Cornelius did not have response data. He had not tracked historical assault-investigation timelines across demographic categories.

Which was itself answer enough.

"The current investigation prioritizes—"

"Protecting institutional authority and maintaining civic order. I know." Xanthe's serpent hair moved in sharp, agitated patterns. "I read the Council minutes. They are public record, available in your excellent library. Very educational regarding whose safety merits emergency protocols versus whose oppression merits procedural acceptance."

"I did not author the roundup mandate."

"But you benefit from the systems that enable it. Your library receives Council funding. Your position carries civic authority. Your species grants you freedom of movement that my people are currently being denied." She set down the spear and stood, moving closer. "You investigate comfortably from inside the power structure and then wonder why we prepare weapons."

"Preparing for armed conflict will only justify Theo's worst enforcement instincts."

"Accepting disarmament will only guarantee our defenselessness when those instincts activate anyway." She gestured toward the deeper tunnels. "You saw the barricades. You saw the weapon preparation. You think we do this casually? You think we want to fight the Watch?"

"I think you are escalating toward violence that will harm everyone involved."

"We are preparing for violence that is already occurring. Roundups are violence. Registration protocols are violence. Forced supervision is violence." Her voice remained level, which somehow made it more intense. "The fact that your Council writes laws authorizing such violence does not make it less violent. It just makes it legal."

Cornelius's tail curled tight. "And if your preparation leads to actual combat? If Watch patrols enter the Enclave and your people resist with force?"

"Then the violence becomes visible enough that even comfortable librarians must acknowledge it." Xanthe picked up her spear again. "Maybe that visibility matters. Maybe forcing people to see what they would rather ignore serves collective good."

"Or maybe it results in casualties that could have been prevented through negotiation."

"We tried negotiation. We tried filing complaints through proper channels. We tried appealing to Temple leadership about biased triage." She tested the spear's balance. "Demos tried helping quietly through unauthorized charity. Look where that got him."

The connection was deliberately provocative. "You believe Demos was attacked because he treated Gorgon patients?"

"I believe people who threaten comfortable systems get eliminated. Whether through petrification, policy, or procedural dismissal." She moved back toward her ledge. "Go back to your library, Cornelius Drake. Catalogue your books. Maintain your neutrality. But when the Watch comes down here with detention orders, remember that you were warned. Remember that we asked for help before we picked up weapons."

"I am helping. I am investigating—"

"You are investigating one crime while ignoring systemic violence that enabled it. You are treating symptoms while preserving the disease." She sat down and resumed sharpening. "When the fighting starts, do not pretend you could not see it coming."

The scraping sound continued, steady and ominous, as Cornelius turned toward the exit.

He climbed back through the wine cellar and emerged into the civic quarter's familiar stone streets. The transition from cistern dampness to city air felt jarring. Above him, the library's dome rose against the sky, solid and permanent.

Safe.

While below ground, an entire community prepared for siege.

Cornelius spread his wings and launched himself toward the library, Xanthe's final words echoing in his mind.

*When the fighting starts, do not pretend you could not see it coming.*

He could see it. He could see the violence building like pressure behind a dam. The Watch organizing enforcement. The Enclave preparing resistance. The systematic failures that had created conditions where roundups seemed reasonable and armed defense seemed necessary.

He could see all of it with perfect clarity.

And he still had no functional idea how to prevent the inevitable explosion.
