"Absolutely not."

Cornelius wedged the slim volume deeper into the gap between the reading table and the wall, pushing it with one taloned foot until only the faintest edge of leather binding remained visible. He stepped back and examined his work with a critical eye. Adequate. The casual observer would never notice it, and Imelda Kassiani, though thorough, was not one to crawl on her stomach searching for contraband.

Behind him, the library hummed with its usual rhythms. Pages turned. Chairs scraped against tiles. Someone coughed near the history section. Normal sounds. Safe sounds. The sounds of order.

Cornelius flicked his tail and moved to the next table.

He had been at this since the morning bell, systematically relocating his most precious acquisitions to places Imelda would not think to inspect. The slim volume—a treatise on early coastal navigation, magnificently illustrated—now resided in temporary asylum. The illuminated songbook had been slipped between two massive legal codices on the top shelf, a location Imelda avoided due to her increasing difficulty with ladders. The first edition medical text, leather cracked with age and use, currently occupied the space beneath a loose floor tile near the mint patch in the courtyard.

He was not hoarding. He was *preserving*. There existed a categorical difference, and the fact that Imelda refused to acknowledge this difference did not make him incorrect.

The library door opened. Cornelius froze, one claw extended toward a treatise on metallurgy.

Imelda's voice carried across the reading room. "Good. You are still here."

Cornelius retracted his claw and turned, arranging his wings in a posture of casual indifference. "I am always here. It is my library."

"It is *the* library." Imelda crossed the floor, her sandals whispering against the tiles. Silver-white braids swung with each step, copper beads clicking softly. She carried a writing board and wore the expression Cornelius had come to recognize as her "we are about to have a conversation you will not enjoy" face. "And I trust you have been making progress on the donation list."

"I have given the matter considerable thought."

"Thought is not the same as action."

"Thought precedes action. One cannot act wisely without first engaging in rigorous intellectual—"

"How many books have you selected?"

Cornelius adjusted his spectacles. "The process is complex. Each volume must be evaluated for historical significance, structural integrity, likelihood of public interest—"

"How many, Cornelius?"

He flexed his claws against the tile. "Three."

"Three."

"Yes. Three carefully chosen volumes that will serve the community adequately while preserving the integrity of the collection."

Imelda set down her writing board and fixed him with the sort of look that made younger librarians confess to misfiling before she even asked a question. "We agreed on fifty books for the charity sale."

"You agreed. I registered my objections."

"Your objections were noted and dismissed."

"Then the process was hardly an agreement."

Imelda sighed, a long exhalation that spoke of decades spent managing both books and the dragons who loved them. She pulled out a chair and sat, knitting her ink-stained fingers together. "The Temple is in need. The winter—" She paused. "The season has been difficult. Demos is treating more patients than he can manage, and their supplies are stretched beyond capacity."

"I am aware." Cornelius had seen the lines outside the Temple. Longer each week. "However, books are not bandages. Selling our collection will not set broken bones or cure fever."

"The money from the sale will purchase what they need."

"For a month. Perhaps two. Then what? We will have depleted our collection for a temporary relief." He began pacing, claws clicking against tile. "These books are irreplaceable. When they are gone, they are *gone*. Knowledge lost. History scattered. I cannot—" He stopped himself, tail lashing once. "I will not participate in the destruction of what I have spent decades protecting."

"No one is asking you to destroy anything. We are asking you to share."

"Sharing implies temporary lending. This is permanent severance."

Imelda stood, smoothing her robes. "I need the list by sunset. Fifty books, Cornelius. If I do not have your selections, I will make them myself."

The threat landed like a stone in water. Cornelius drew himself up to his full height—which, admittedly, only brought his head level with Imelda's knee—and spread his wings. "You would not dare."

"I have the authority and the ladder. Do not test me."

They regarded each other across the reading table. Somewhere in the back stacks, someone dropped a scroll. The papyrus rattled against the floor.

Cornelius folded his wings. "I will provide a list."

"Fifty books."

"A list of considerable length."

"With fifty titles on it."

"I make no promises regarding the quality of those titles."

"I will review your selections personally." Imelda collected her writing board. "If I find you have listed fifty copies of *The Comprehensive Guide to Bathhouse Maintenance*, we will have another conversation."

She left him alone with the books and his thoughts.

Cornelius waited until her footsteps faded before slumping against the table leg. Fifty books. Fifty irreplaceable volumes cast into the chaos of public ownership, where they would be handled with unwashed hands, read without proper respect, shelved incorrectly, or worse—loaned out and never returned.

He looked at the metallurgy treatise. Perhaps if he shelved it with the agricultural texts, Imelda would overlook it.

He was still contemplating hiding strategies when the noise from the square drifted through the library's open windows.

Raised voices. Not the cheerful argument of merchants haggling, but something sharper. Angrier.

Cornelius abandoned the treatise and moved to the window.

The town square spread below the library's elevated position, a mosaic of people and market stalls arranged around the central fountain. The fountain itself—a gift from the Kallistos tile family, depicting dolphins in blue and silver ceramic—usually provided a soothing background murmur. Today the water sounds were drowned by shouting.

A crowd had gathered near the fountain steps. Cornelius could see the distinctive grey robes of Temple healers. Two of them. One was Brother Demos, his half-elf height making him visible above the surrounding humans. The other was Sister Photine, standing slightly apart.

Facing them was a Gorgon woman Cornelius recognized as Xanthe. She held herself with the coiled tension of someone ready to strike or flee.

The crowd gave her space. Of course they did.

Cornelius debated returning to his book-hiding. Public disagreements were common enough, and rarely his concern. His responsibility lay with the written word, not the spoken argument.

But something about the scene pulled at his attention. Perhaps it was the way the crowd had formed—not a casual gathering of curious onlookers, but a wall of witnesses, blocking the paths away from the fountain. Perhaps it was the rigid set of Demos's shoulders, or the way Photine had wrapped her arms around herself despite the warmth.

Or perhaps it was simply that he needed a distraction from Imelda's impossible demands.

Cornelius spread his wings and launched himself from the window ledge.

The glide down to the square was brief but satisfying. Air rushed past his scales, warm and carrying the scents of baked bread from Cassius's shop, olive oil from the market stalls, and the ever-present salt tang from the harbor. He landed on the fountain's rim, tucked his wings, and positioned himself where he could observe without being obvious.

Not that dragons were ever truly inconspicuous, but one learned to minimize one's profile.

"—don't care about protocol!" Xanthe's voice cut across the square. "She is *dying*. You helped Markos's daughter last month. You set Yiayia Despina's grandson's leg the week before. But my cousin is not worth your time?"

Demos spread his hands in a gesture that managed to be both apologetic and immovable. "I explained this. The leg was a compound fracture. Immediate intervention prevented permanent damage. Your cousin has a fever—"

"Had. She *had* a fever. It has been three days. Now she cannot stand without help."

"I understand your concern—"

"You understand *nothing*." Xanthe took a step forward. The crowd shifted, murmurs rippling through the assembled witnesses. "You sit in your Temple with your rules and your lists, deciding who suffers and who gets relief. You are not healers. You are gatekeepers."

"We are both." Demos's voice remained level, but Cornelius could see the tension in his jaw. "Our resources are not infinite. If I treat every fever, I will have nothing left for the injuries and illnesses that will kill within hours. Triage is not cruelty. It is mathematics."

"It is murder by another name."

"It is survival."

Someone in the crowd made a warding gesture. Cornelius recognized the motion—a remnant of older, less enlightened times when people believed Gorgon anger could petrify without intent. Superstitious nonsense, of course. Petrification required direct eye contact, sustained focus, and deliberate magical channeling. One could not accidentally turn someone to stone any more than one could accidentally conjugate a verb.

But superstition was not susceptible to logic.

Xanthe saw the gesture too. Her hands curled into fists. "You see? This is what we are to you. Monsters to be managed. Threats to be contained. Never mind that we pay the same taxes, follow the same laws, breathe the same air. When we need help, there is always a reason we must wait."

"The Temple serves everyone according to need—"

"The Temple serves everyone according to *convenience*." Xanthe's voice dropped, going quiet and sharp. "My cousin has done nothing wrong. She works at the washhouse. She tends her garden. She harms no one. But she is Gorgon, and so her fever is not urgent. Her pain is not priority. Her *life* is not worth disrupting your precious schedule."

Demos closed his eyes briefly. When he opened them, Cornelius saw something that surprised him: genuine sorrow. "If I could heal everyone, I would. But I cannot. The supplies we have, the time we have, the energy we have—it is all limited. If your cousin's condition worsens, bring her to the Temple. We will assess—"

"Assessment is not treatment."

"It is what I can offer."

Xanthe stared at him. The square had gone quiet enough that Cornelius could hear the fountain water splashing against ceramic. 

"Then your offer is worthless," Xanthe said.

She turned and walked away. The crowd parted for her instantly, bodies shifting to create a clear path. No one touched her. No one spoke.

Cornelius watched her go, then turned his attention to Demos.

The half-elf stood very still, hands hanging at his sides. His expression was carefully neutral, but Cornelius could see the cost of maintaining it in the tightness around his eyes, the deliberate control of his breathing.

This was not a man enjoying his authority. This was a man being crushed by it.

Sister Photine moved to Demos's side and touched his shoulder. They exchanged words too quiet for Cornelius to hear, then began walking back toward the Temple.

That was when Cornelius got a clear look at Photine.

He had seen her before, of course. The library and the Temple shared resources and space, and Photine occasionally consulted the medical texts in the collection. She was perhaps fifty years old, competent, professional, and generally too busy to engage in prolonged conversation—which Cornelius appreciated.

But the woman walking away from the fountain looked a decade older than the healer he remembered.

Her grey robes hung loose on a frame that had lost flesh. Dark circles shadowed her eyes. Her hands, normally steady enough to suture wounds and mix precise doses, trembled as she gripped Demos's arm.

And her expression, in the moment before she turned away, was not tired or frustrated or sad.

It was terrified.

The crowd began to disperse, breaking into smaller clusters of conversation. Cornelius caught fragments as people passed the fountain.

"—should have helped her—"

"—can't just give medicine to everyone who asks—"

"—Gorgons always think they deserve special treatment—"

"—my sister waited two weeks for her elbow—"

"—not about deserving, it is about *affording*—"

That brought Cornelius up short. He turned toward the speakers, two human women with the callused hands of washerwomen.

"Xanthe has money," the first said. "She does leatherwork. Good leather, too. I bought a belt from her last spring."

"Money does not matter if there is no supply to buy." The second woman shifted her basket to her other hip. "My cousin works at the Temple. She says they have been running out of everything. Fever root. Boneset. Even basic bandage cloth. Demos has been rationing since—" She paused. "Well, for a while now."

"That cannot be right. The Temple families fund them."

"Funded. Past tense." The woman lowered her voice. "There is talk that the donations have dried up. The Kallistos family had a bad tile season. The Doukas family is focused on the harbor expansion. The Veneti family is—well, you know about their internal troubles. Meanwhile, everyone needs more healing than usual, and there is less to give."

They moved on, leaving Cornelius alone with this new information.

The Temple was running out of supplies.

Which meant Demos's refusal was not political or prejudiced. It was practical. He genuinely did not have enough medicine to treat every case. He was performing triage because the alternative was running out entirely and helping no one.

And Imelda wanted Cornelius to donate fifty books to raise money for this failing system.

Temporary relief, he had called it. But perhaps temporary relief was all anyone could manage. Perhaps the choice was not between permanent solutions and futile gestures, but between futile gestures and no gestures at all.

Cornelius looked back toward the library, thinking of the slim volume wedged behind the reading table. A treatise on coastal navigation. Beautiful illustrations. Irreplaceable historical document.

Also: completely useless for healing fever.

He thought of the three books he had selected for the donation list. All worthy volumes. All texts he would not miss terribly. All safe choices that cost him nothing.

Fifty books. Imelda had demanded fifty.

Cornelius spread his wings and launched himself back toward the library window, but his trajectory felt heavier than usual, weighted by something more than bronze scales and academic robes.

The reading room was empty when he landed. He walked to the table where he had hidden the navigation treatise and stared at the gap.

He could leave it there. Imelda would never find it. The book would remain safe in his collection, preserved for future scholars who would appreciate its value.

Or he could add it to the list.

One book would raise perhaps five silver marks at the charity sale. Enough to purchase basic bandage cloth, or a small amount of fever root. Not enough to save Xanthe's cousin, probably. Not enough to solve the Temple's fundamental resource problem.

But enough to help someone. Perhaps several someones.

Cornelius pulled the treatise from its hiding place and set it on the table. The leather binding was warm from its confinement. He opened to the first page, where the cartographer's elegant script described the proper method for determining latitude by star position.

Valuable. Beautiful. Irreplaceable.

And currently worth less than bandages.

He closed the book and moved to retrieve the illuminated songbook from between the legal codices.

By the time Imelda returned to check on his progress, Cornelius had assembled a stack of twenty-three volumes on the central reading table. Not fifty. He could not bring himself to fifty. But twenty-three was more than three, and several of them were pieces he had planned to keep indefinitely.

Imelda looked at the stack, then at Cornelius.

"It is a start," she said.

Cornelius said nothing. He was watching the library entrance, where a window faced the square.

Somewhere out there, Xanthe was caring for a dying cousin with whatever resources she could scrape together. Demos was returning to a Temple that demanded he perform miracles with dwindling supplies. And Photine—

Photine was terrified.

Cornelius did not know why, precisely. But he knew the look of someone carrying a weight too heavy to bear, and he knew the expression of someone running out of time.

"I will add more to the list," he said quietly. "But I need time to select them properly."

"You have until sunset."

"That is not sufficient—"

"Sunset, Cornelius." But Imelda's voice was gentler now. She reached out and straightened the top book on his stack. "I know this is difficult. But it is necessary."

"Necessity is a tyrant that demands we sacrifice our principles."

"Sometimes. And sometimes it demands we live up to them." She patted his head, a gesture he normally would have protested, and left him alone with his inadequate stack of offerings.

Cornelius spent the remainder of the afternoon pulling books from shelves and trying to calculate their worth in units of human suffering prevented. It was an impossible equation. How did one measure the value of knowledge against the value of medicine? How did one weigh history against health?

By sunset, he had forty-seven volumes assembled. Three short of Imelda's demand, but significantly more than he had thought himself capable of surrendering.

He delivered the list to her office and left before she could comment on the deficit.

The library closed as the light faded. Cornelius performed his usual evening routine: checking that all candles were properly extinguished, ensuring windows were latched, verifying that no books had been misshelved by patrons who thought they understood proper cataloging but demonstrably did not.

Everything was in order.

Everything except the hollow feeling in his chest where his certainty used to rest.

He climbed to his usual roosting spot in the library's small dome, where the curved ceiling collected warmth and the height provided a view of the town below. The square was dark now, the fountain a shadow against deeper shadows. The Temple windows glowed with lamplight—Demos and Photine working late, no doubt, trying to stretch insufficient resources across infinite need.

Cornelius settled onto his perch and tucked his wings. Tomorrow he would begin the process of properly cataloging his reduced collection. Tomorrow he would adapt to the new shape of his hoard.

Tonight, he simply sat in the dark and wondered if knowledge truly mattered when people were dying for lack of bandages.

The question did not have a satisfying answer.

He was still thinking about it when sleep finally claimed him, pulling him down into dreams where books transformed into medicine bottles, and every page he turned revealed another empty shelf.

# Chapter 2

"Do not touch anything."

Cornelius landed on the Archive threshold and folded his wings with precise movements, buying himself three additional seconds to process what lay before him. The delay did not help. Brother Demos remained exactly as impossible as he had appeared from the air: a statue where a person should be, grey stone where flesh had been, stillness where life belonged.

"I have not moved since I sent for you." Imelda stood near the far wall, her hands clasped so tightly her knuckles had gone white. "I found him like this when I came to retrieve the medical texts you requested for cataloging."

Cornelius approached the statue slowly, claws clicking against the Archive's tile floor. The sound echoed wrong in the enclosed space, too sharp and solitary. The Archives were always quiet—they occupied the oldest section of the Temple, where thick stone walls muffled the sounds of the clinic above—but this silence had weight to it. Presence.

The statue that had been Demos stood beside one of the record shelves, one hand extended toward a leather-bound ledger. The position suggested he had been reaching for the volume when the petrification occurred. His expression was not one of fear or pain, but of mild concentration, as though he had been mentally reviewing which page he needed.

He looked peaceful. That somehow made it worse.

Cornelius circled the figure, forcing himself into the methodical observation pattern he used for damaged manuscripts. Assess. Catalog. Understand.

The stone was uniform grey, the color of river clay after firing. No visible cracks or flaws marred the surface. The texture appeared smooth, almost ceramic, though Cornelius did not yet trust himself to touch it. The clothing had been transformed along with the flesh—robes, sandals, even the leather bag slung across Demos's shoulder had become stone, their folds and creases preserved with uncomfortable accuracy.

"How long has he been like this?" Cornelius kept his voice level, professional. A problem to be solved. Nothing more.

"I do not know. I last saw him yesterday evening, just after sunset. He mentioned needing to file the week's clinic reports." Imelda moved closer but maintained her distance from the statue, as though proximity might be contagious. "He would have come here directly. The filing system is his responsibility."

Cornelius examined the floor around the statue's base. No scuff marks. No sign of struggle. The tiles were dusty—the Archives were cleaned monthly rather than daily, as few people had cause to visit—but the dust appeared undisturbed except for Imelda's footprints leading from the door to her current position.

"No one else has been in here since you found him?"

"No. I locked the door immediately and sent for you." Imelda's voice carried the careful control of someone refusing to panic through sheer force of will. "Sister Photine is with a patient in the upper clinic. I have not yet informed her."

Cornelius nodded slowly, still circling. Petrification was not common, but it was documented. Gorgons possessed the ability as both defensive mechanism and, occasionally, attack. The transformation could be reversed if addressed quickly enough. The key question was how quickly.

He stopped in front of the statue and steeled himself. "I need to touch it."

"Are you certain that is safe?"

"No." Cornelius extended one claw and placed it gently against the statue's shoulder.

Stone. Definitely stone. Cool to the touch, with the slight texture of fired clay. Not marble—that would be smoother. Not granite—that would be rougher. Something in between, something that had been organic and was now decidedly not.

He pressed slightly harder, testing for give. None. The shoulder was as solid as the floor beneath his feet.

But—

Cornelius moved his claw to the statue's neck, just below the jaw, where a pulse would be if this were still a living body. He held very still, filtering out the background sounds: Imelda's breathing, his own heartbeat, the distant murmur of clinic activity from above.

There.

Faint. Impossibly faint. But present.

A vibration. Not a pulse exactly, but a tremor, as though something deep within the stone was still moving. Still trying.

"He is alive." Cornelius withdrew his claw and checked the observation from two other points—wrist and temple. The same subtle vibration in each location. "The petrification is not complete. His body is attempting to maintain biological function despite the transformation."

"Then he can be restored?"

"Possibly. Probably." Cornelius sat back on his haunches, calculating. "The literature on Gorgon petrification is frustratingly sparse, but the consensus among reliable sources suggests a window of reversibility. If the transformation can be undone before the biological processes fully cease, the victim returns to flesh largely unharmed."

"How long is the window?"

"Seventy-two hours from the moment of petrification." Cornelius looked at the statue's extended hand, still reaching for the ledger. "After that, the stone becomes permanent. The vibration stops. What remains is simply statue."

Imelda closed her eyes briefly. "Three days."

"Less than that now. If he was transformed last night—" Cornelius examined the ledger Demos had been reaching for. It lay on the shelf exactly where it belonged, undisturbed. "What time did you find him?"

"Just after the morning bell. Perhaps two hours ago."

"Then we have between fifty-eight and seventy hours, depending on the precise moment of transformation." Cornelius pulled his spectacles from his leather satchel and settled them onto his snout, though they would do nothing to improve his understanding of the situation. They simply felt correct. "The question is whether we can locate a Gorgon capable of reversal and willing to perform it."

"Captain Theo will need to be informed."

"Captain Theo will immediately blame the nearest Gorgon and arrest them without evidence." Cornelius moved to examine the shelf nearest the statue. "Which will be counterproductive if we need Gorgon cooperation to restore Demos."

"The law requires we report—"

"I am not suggesting we hide a body, Imelda. I am suggesting we gather information before we invite Theo to impose his traditional approach to investigation."

He ran one claw along the shelf edge, checking for disturbances. The dust here was thicker, marked only by the faint outline where Demos's hand had brushed against it while reaching for the ledger. No other marks. No sign anyone else had touched this shelf recently.

Cornelius pulled the ledger Demos had been reaching for and opened it carefully. Birth records. The most recent entries dated back three weeks. Names, parentage, attending healer. All in Demos's precise handwriting.

Nothing that would obviously motivate murder.

Though calling this murder felt premature. Petrification could be accidental—a Gorgon startled into reflexive defense, eye contact made without intent. It could be assault—a deliberate attack meant to harm but not kill. It could be something else entirely.

Cornelius closed the ledger and returned it to the shelf. He was examining the next volume when he caught the scent.

Faint. Nearly buried under the Archive's base notes of old paper and dried lavender. But present.

Sandalwood.

He moved closer to the statue, following the scent. Stronger near the statue's left side, near the leather bag transformed to stone against Demos's hip.

Sandalwood was not a medical scent. The Temple used lavender for calming, mint for clarity, alcohol for sterilization. Sandalwood belonged to personal perfumes or decorative incense, neither of which were part of Temple routine.

Cornelius committed the detail to memory and stepped back.

The door rattled. A fist pounded against wood. "Imelda! Open this door immediately!"

Imelda and Cornelius exchanged a look.

"Captain Theo," they said in unison.

Imelda moved to unlock the door. Cornelius positioned himself between the entrance and the statue, wings slightly spread. Not blocking access—that would be futile—but establishing that he was present and observing.

The door swung open. Captain Theo entered with the controlled urgency of a man accustomed to crime scenes, followed by two City Watch guards. He stopped three steps into the Archive, his gaze locking onto the statue.

"Fates preserve us." Theo's voice dropped to something between prayer and curse. "How long?"

"Since last night, we believe." Imelda closed the door behind the guards. "I found him this morning when I came to retrieve texts for the library."

"And you waited to inform the Watch because—?" Theo turned to her, eyebrows raised.

"Because I informed Cornelius first. His expertise in petrification reversal seemed more immediately relevant than your expertise in arresting people."

Theo's jaw tightened, but he moved to examine the statue rather than engage in argument. He circled it once, his expression hardening with each step.

"Gorgon," he said flatly. "Has to be. No other species can do this."

"Accurate but insufficient." Cornelius kept his tone academic, removing emotion from the analysis. "Saying a Gorgon did this is like saying a human wrote a threatening letter. Technically correct but not particularly useful for identifying which specific individual committed the act."

"There are protocols for this."

"There are protocols for murder. This is not yet murder."

Theo turned to face him. "That is a statue where my town's junior healer used to be. What would you call it?"

"Assault. Possibly accidental transformation. Definitely reversible within the seventy-two hour window, assuming we locate the individual responsible and convince them to undo it." Cornelius gestured toward the statue with one wing. "He is still alive in there. Barely, but measurably. Which means our priority should be restoration, not revenge."

"Restoration requires knowing who did this."

"Agreed. Which is why I have been examining the scene rather than jumping to convenient conclusions."

One of the guards shifted uncomfortably. Theo shot him a quelling look before returning his attention to Cornelius. "What have you found?"

"No signs of struggle. No disturbance beyond Imelda's entrance this morning. Demos was reaching for a birth ledger when the transformation occurred, suggesting he was engaged in routine work rather than confrontation." Cornelius paused. "And there is a scent of sandalwood near the body. Faint but present."

"Sandalwood?" Theo frowned. "The Temple does not use sandalwood."

"Precisely."

"Could be from perfume. Personal scent."

"Demos does not wear perfume." Imelda spoke with the certainty of someone who had worked alongside the healer for years. "He considers it unprofessional in a medical setting."

The door opened again. Sister Photine entered, her grey robes whispering against the floor. She stopped when she saw the cluster of people around the statue, her face draining of what little color it held.

"No." The word came out small. Broken. "No, not—"

She crossed the space in four strides and reached for the statue. Cornelius moved to intercept, catching her wrist gently in one claw.

"Do not touch him yet. We do not know if contact might cause further harm."

Photine stared at the statue, her breathing shallow. "How long has he—when did this—"

"Sometime last night," Imelda said softly. "I found him this morning."

"He is still alive." Cornelius kept his grip light but firm. "There is a seventy-two hour window for reversal. We have time."

"Time." Photine's voice held something beyond grief. That same terror Cornelius had noted in the square, now given concrete shape. She looked at Theo. "You need to lock down the Gorgon quarter."

Theo straightened. "I was about to suggest exactly that."

"No." Cornelius released Photine's wrist but moved between her and Theo. "Absolutely not. Antagonizing the entire Gorgon community will not help us identify the specific individual responsible."

"One of them did this." Photine's hands shook as she gestured toward the statue. "One of them came into our Temple and turned our healer to stone. You want me to trust that they will simply cooperate?"

"I want you to recognize that collective punishment will guarantee they do not cooperate." Cornelius kept his voice level despite the tension vibrating through his scales. "If you treat every Gorgon as a suspect, none of them will help you. And you need their help. Reversal requires the original Gorgon's participation. Arrest the wrong person and Demos stays stone."

"He is right." Imelda moved to stand beside Cornelius. "The lockdown will create more problems than it solves."

Theo crossed his arms. "Then what do you suggest? We ask politely if anyone happened to petrify our healer and could they please undo it?"

"We investigate properly." Cornelius gestured toward the statue. "We determine who had access to the Archives last night. We identify who uses sandalwood. We establish motive. Then we make an arrest based on evidence rather than species."

"This is not an academic exercise, Drake. We have less than three days."

"Which is why we should not waste time arresting random Gorgons in hopes one of them is guilty."

Photine pressed her hands to her face, breathing hard. "It is happening again. Just like before. Just like—" She cut herself off, shaking her head.

Cornelius filed that detail away. *Again.* This was not the first time Photine had experienced something like this. The fear from the square suddenly had context, though the specifics remained unclear.

Theo watched Photine's distress, his expression softening slightly. "Sister, I understand this is difficult, but we need to act decisively—"

"Decisively does not mean recklessly." Imelda's voice carried the authority of someone accustomed to ending arguments through sheer certainty. "Cornelius is correct. We investigate first. Then we arrest."

"And while we investigate, the Gorgon responsible could flee."

"Or they could be standing in this room right now, listening to you plan to arrest them for something they did not do." Cornelius met Theo's gaze steadily. "Gorgons are not interchangeable. They are individuals. Treat them as such."

Theo's jaw worked. Behind him, the two guards maintained careful neutrality, their faces revealing nothing.

Finally, Theo exhaled. "Fine. We investigate first. But I am posting guards at the Archive entrance and the Temple perimeter. No one enters or leaves without documentation."

"Acceptable."

"And I want a list of every Gorgon who had access to the Temple in the last week."

Cornelius's tail twitched. "That information exists in the visitor logs and patient records. I will compile it."

"You will?"

"I am a librarian. I catalog things. This is simply cataloging on a deadline."

Photine lowered her hands, her eyes red but dry. "I keep the patient records in my office. You may access them whenever you need." She looked back at the statue. "Can I—is it safe to touch him now?"

Cornelius considered. "Brief contact should be harmless. I would avoid sustained pressure or attempting to move him."

She approached the statue slowly, reaching out to touch the stone face. Her fingers traced the line of Demos's jaw, gentle as handling porcelain.

"I told him to go home," she whispered. "Last night. He was exhausted, and I told him the filing could wait until morning." Her hand dropped. "If he had listened, he would still—"

"If he had listened, you might have been the one working late in the Archives." Cornelius kept his tone matter-of-fact, refusing to let sentiment cloud logic. "Guilt is not productive. Focus on restoration."

Photine nodded without looking at him. "Seventy-two hours."

"Less now. Perhaps sixty."

"Then we should stop wasting time." She turned to face Theo and Cornelius, her fear crystallizing into something harder. "Find them. Find whoever did this and bring them to me. I will not lose another—" Again, she stopped herself. "Just find them."

She left, her footsteps quick and sharp against the tiles.

Theo watched her go, frowning. "She is hiding something."

"She is terrified," Cornelius corrected. "There is a difference."

"Terror usually has a source."

"Questions for later. Right now, we have a more immediate problem." Cornelius moved back to the statue, examining the extended hand once more. "I need to determine the precise moment of transformation to calculate our remaining time accurately. That requires more information about Demos's schedule and movements last night."

"I will handle witness interviews." Theo gestured to his guards. "You two, station yourselves outside the Archive door. No one enters without my authorization."

The guards moved to comply. Theo paused in the doorway, looking back at Cornelius. "For what it is worth, Drake—I hope you are right. I hope this is something we can solve carefully." He touched the doorframe. "But if we run out of time, I will arrest every Gorgon in the quarter if that is what it takes to save him."

"If we run out of time, arresting people will accomplish nothing except satisfying your need to punish someone."

"Perhaps. But at least I will have tried everything."

Theo left, his boots echoing down the corridor.

Imelda waited until the sound faded before speaking. "He means well."

"Meaning well is insufficient when dealing with complex problems." Cornelius adjusted his spectacles and returned his attention to the statue. "Though I suppose meaning well is better than meaning ill."

"High praise from you."

Cornelius ignored the dry observation. He leaned closer to the statue's shoulder, where the sandalwood scent was strongest. Not perfume—perfume would be lighter, more diffuse. This was concentrated. Deliberate.

Oil, perhaps. Or incense recently burned, the scent clinging to clothing.

He pulled a small notebook from his satchel and began recording observations. Time of discovery. Physical state of the statue. Presence of sandalwood. Photine's reaction. Theo's assumptions.

The pencil scratched against paper, filling the Archive's silence with purposeful sound.

"What are you thinking?" Imelda asked quietly.

"I am thinking," Cornelius said, not looking up from his notes, "that whoever did this took considerable care to make it look careless. The positioning suggests accident—Demos was working normally, transformation occurred suddenly. But the sandalwood suggests premeditation. Planning." He tapped the pencil against the notebook. "And I am thinking that Photine's fear existed before this morning. She was already expecting something terrible."

"You noticed that in the square yesterday."

"Yes. Which means this attack—if it is an attack—fits into a larger pattern she recognizes." Cornelius closed the notebook and looked at the statue. "The question is whether that pattern involves Gorgons, or whether Gorgons are convenient scapegoats for something else entirely."

Somewhere above them, the Temple bell rang, marking the hour. Time continuing its steady march toward the seventy-two hour threshold.

Cornelius spread his wings and moved toward the door. "I need to examine the visitor logs and patient records. You should return to the library and secure any texts on Petrification reversal we possess."

"Where will you start?"

"With the assumption that nothing here is accidental." Cornelius paused in the doorway, looking back at the statue one final time. "Demos was not random. The Archives were not random. And the sandalwood was definitely not random."

He left Imelda standing guard and climbed toward the Temple's upper levels where the administrative records were kept. His mind was already sorting possibilities into categories, building frameworks of logic around the central question:

Who would turn a healer to stone, and why would they want everyone to blame the Gorgons?

The answer, he was certain, would not be simple.

But then, the best mysteries never were.

# Chapter 3

"You were seen near the Temple the night before last."

Cornelius settled onto the stone bench at the back of the Town Hall's interrogation loggia and arranged his tail to avoid the gap between tiles. Captain Theo stood at the center of the space, arms crossed, while Kyra Kallistos perched on the witness chair like a bird prepared for flight. Two Watch guards flanked the entrance—standard procedure, though Cornelius suspected their primary function was theatrical rather than practical.

Kyra smoothed her silk chiton with hands that trembled slightly. "I visit the Temple frequently. I make donations. It is hardly unusual."

"At sunset?"

"The Temple does not close at sunset."

"No. But most visitors conduct their business during daylight hours." Theo consulted his notes. "You were observed entering through the south gate just as the evening bell rang. You remained inside for approximately one hour. What was the nature of your visit?"

Kyra's gaze flicked toward the guards, then back to Theo. "Personal business."

"Personal business with whom?"

"I do not see how that is relevant to—"

"A healer has been petrified, Citizen Kallistos. Everything is relevant until I determine otherwise."

Cornelius watched Kyra's posture shift. Her spine straightened. Her chin lifted. The trembling hands stilled as she folded them in her lap with deliberate precision. It was the physical translation of someone building walls.

"I consulted with Sister Photine regarding a private medical matter," Kyra said, each word placed carefully. "The consultation concluded. I left through the south gate. I encountered no one in the Archives because I had no reason to enter the Archives."

"What medical matter?"

"As I said, it was private."

"Privacy is a luxury during murder investigations."

"Brother Demos is not dead." Kyra's voice sharpened. "That was made quite clear during your summons this morning. Petrified, yes. Reversible within seventy-two hours. Those were your exact words."

Theo's jaw tightened. "Assault, then. The point stands."

"Does it? Because it seems you are questioning me based solely on my species rather than any actual evidence of wrongdoing."

"I am questioning you because you were present at the Temple during the window when the petrification occurred."

"So was every patient who sought treatment that evening. So was every healer on duty. So was anyone who walked past the Temple on their way home." Kyra gestured toward the square beyond the loggia. "Half the town moves through the Temple district at sunset. Are you interrogating all of them?"

Cornelius made a note in his ledger. Kyra's evasion regarding the medical consultation was notable, but her logic regarding Theo's methodology was sound. Presence at the Temple did not equate to presence in the Archives, and Theo had yet to establish a procedural path between the two locations.

Theo leaned against the table, deliberately casual. "How well do you know Xanthe?"

The question produced a visible flinch. Kyra recovered quickly, but Cornelius noted the reaction. Fear? Embarrassment? Something else entirely?

"We are acquainted," Kyra said. "The community is not large. Everyone knows everyone."

"But you are cousins. Family."

"Distant cousins. We do not socialize regularly."

"No? I was told you attended the Gorgon Enclave gathering last month. That seems social."

Kyra's hands clenched briefly before smoothing flat again. "Attendance at community events is expected. It does not indicate personal closeness."

"Strange. Because when I mentioned Xanthe's name, you looked like I had struck you."

"I did not—" Kyra stopped, visibly recalibrating. "Captain, I came here voluntarily when summoned. I have answered your questions. But I will not sit here while you fabricate reactions to support whatever theory you have already decided upon."

She stood. Theo straightened but did not move to block her path.

"If you intend to arrest me," Kyra said, "do so. Otherwise, I have business to attend to."

"I may have additional questions."

"Then you know where to find me." Kyra swept past the guards, her silk chiton whispering against stone. She did not look at Cornelius as she departed, though he suspected she was aware of his presence. Gorgons possessed exceptional peripheral vision—a biological adaptation to avoid accidental petrification of allies.

The loggia settled into silence. Theo made several additions to his notes, the pencil scratching sharp against paper.

Cornelius cleared his throat. "She is hiding something."

"Obviously." Theo did not look up from his writing. "The question is whether she is hiding involvement in the assault or simply protecting her reputation."

"Reputation regarding what?"

"The Kallistos family is—" Theo paused, selecting words carefully. "—particular about public perception. They have built their social position through careful curation of image. A Gorgon family member consulting the Temple healers for certain types of medical assistance would be considered embarrassing."

"What types of medical assistance would be embarrassing?"

Theo finally looked at him. "The type that involves passing."

Cornelius required three seconds to process the implication. Passing. The practice of Gorgons using medical intervention to appear more human—magical suppression of natural traits, cosmetic alterations, behavioral coaching. It was legal but controversial, viewed by some Gorgons as necessary survival and by others as cultural betrayal.

"Ah," Cornelius said.

"Yes. Ah." Theo returned to his notes. "Which means Kyra likely has a legitimate reason for evasion unrelated to petrification. But I cannot eliminate her as a suspect based on embarrassment alone."

"Agreed. Though I would note that her reaction to Xanthe's name suggests tension between them. If that tension relates to differing views on passing versus cultural authenticity, it might create additional complications in the community."

"Already noted." Theo tapped his pencil against the table. "Xanthe is next. Given her public confrontation with Demos yesterday, she moves to the top of the suspect list."

Cornelius shifted his weight, tail curling around his feet. "Suspicion based on public argument is circumstantial."

"Suspicion based on motive, opportunity, and demonstrated hostility toward the victim is investigative prudence."

"Demonstrated hostility toward Temple triage policy. Not toward Demos personally."

"She accused him of murder."

"She accused the *system* of murder by neglect. There is a categorical difference."

Theo set down his pencil with deliberate care. "Drake, I appreciate your analytical perspective. Truly. But you need to understand something about practical law enforcement. When someone publicly threatens a victim and that victim is subsequently attacked, the public threat becomes relevant regardless of philosophical nuance."

"Xanthe did not threaten Demos. She argued with him."

"She called him a gatekeeper denying her dying cousin medical care."

"Which, I note, was factually accurate given the Temple's supply constraints."

"That does not give her the right to petrify him in retaliation."

"No one has established that she *did* petrify him. You are constructing causality from temporal proximity and emotional intensity, neither of which constitute proof."

The guards at the entrance exchanged glances. Cornelius ignored them. Theo rubbed his temples as though developing a headache.

"Are you finished?" Theo asked.

"That depends on whether you intend to conduct an actual investigation or simply confirm your existing assumptions through selective interrogation."

"I am investigating. I am doing so by questioning the individual with the clearest motive."

"Motive is insufficient without means and opportunity. Has Xanthe demonstrated ability to petrify?"

"She is Gorgon. All Gorgons possess the biological capacity."

"All humans possess the biological capacity to strangle someone with their hands. That does not make every human a murder suspect when strangulation occurs."

Theo's expression shifted into something harder. "The comparison is not equivalent. Gorgon petrification is a documented magical ability used both defensively and offensively throughout recorded history. It is reasonable to investigate Gorgons first when petrification occurs, just as it would be reasonable to investigate mages first if someone were killed by magical fire."

Cornelius flexed his claws against the stone bench. The logic was sound in abstract. The application, however, carried the weight of historical prejudice that transformed reasonable investigation into targeted harassment.

Before he could formulate a response, footsteps echoed from the square. Xanthe appeared at the loggia entrance, flanked by two different guards. She walked with the controlled deliberation of someone refusing to be escorted, though the guards maintained close proximity.

"You summoned me, Captain." Xanthe's voice carried the flat quality of suppressed anger. "I am here."

Theo gestured toward the witness chair. "Please, sit."

"I prefer to stand."

"It was not a request."

Xanthe remained standing for three additional seconds—enough to establish that her eventual compliance was choice rather than obedience—before settling onto the chair. She did not arrange her posture for comfort or presentation. She simply sat, arms crossed, meeting Theo's gaze with unwavering directness.

Cornelius noted the purple shadows beneath her eyes, the tension in her shoulders, the ink stains on her fingers. A leatherworker's hands, marked by dye and tool work. She wore practical clothing—leather vest over linen tunic, trousers rather than chiton—and carried herself with the braced posture of someone expecting attack.

"You had a public altercation with Brother Demos in the square yesterday," Theo began.

"I had a conversation about medical neglect. If you consider that an altercation, your threshold for conflict is remarkably low."

"You accused him of allowing your cousin to die."

"I stated facts. My cousin is ill. The Temple refuses treatment. These are observable realities, not accusations."

"The Temple explained their triage protocols—"

"The Temple explained their priorities. Which apparently place Gorgon lives below human convenience."

Theo's pencil stilled against his notes. "That is a serious accusation."

"It is a documented pattern. Markos's daughter received immediate care for a broken leg. Yiayia Despina's grandson received immediate care for a dislocated shoulder. My cousin, suffering from an escalating fever, was told to wait for assessment." Xanthe leaned forward slightly. "The difference is not medical urgency. The difference is species."

"Or the difference is available resources and the severity of immediate complications."

"How convenient that the available resources are never sufficient when Gorgons require them."

Cornelius made a note. Xanthe's argument mirrored her statements from the square with remarkable consistency. Either she was repeating a genuinely held belief, or she was maintaining a prepared narrative. Both possibilities remained plausible.

Theo set down his pencil. "Where were you the night before last, between sunset and midnight?"

"At home. Working."

"Can anyone confirm that?"

"My cousin. Though given her fever, I suspect you would dismiss her testimony as unreliable."

"Anyone else?"

"No. I work alone."

"How convenient."

Xanthe's hands curled into fists. "Convenient would be having an alibi that satisfies your predetermined conclusion. Unfortunately, I spent the evening creating leather goods and caring for my ill cousin rather than arranging witnesses to my innocence."

"Did you visit the Temple that evening?"

"No."

"The south gate guard logged a Gorgon visitor entering at sunset."

"Then it was not me. There are other Gorgons in this city, Captain. We do not share a collective consciousness."

"But you do share collective grievances against the Temple."

"We share justified frustration with systemic discrimination. That is not the same as collective guilt."

Theo leaned against the table, mirroring the casual posture he had used with Kyra. "You argued publicly with Demos. You accused him of cruelty. You have documented history of advocating for—" he consulted his notes "—'aggressive community action' during Enclave meetings. And now Demos is petrified. You understand why that sequence looks suspicious."

"I understand that you want a convenient suspect to satisfy public anxiety. I am not required to help you construct a case against myself."

"Cooperation would suggest innocence."

"Cooperation would suggest I trust your interest in truth over expediency. I do not."

The loggia went quiet. Somewhere in the square, a merchant called out prices for olive oil. A cart rattled past on stone wheels. Normal sounds, continuing despite the abnormal conversation.

Cornelius stood, his claws clicking against the bench. Both Theo and Xanthe turned toward him.

"I have a question," Cornelius said.

Theo gestured permission. Xanthe simply waited.

"Petrification," Cornelius continued, "requires sustained eye contact and focused magical channeling. It is not—despite popular mythology—an instantaneous or reflexive process. The transformation takes between fifteen and forty-five seconds, depending on the caster's skill and the target's resistance."

"Your point?" Theo asked.

"Brother Demos was petrified while reaching for a ledger in the Archives. His position indicates he was engaged in routine filing when the transformation occurred. There is no evidence of struggle, no displaced books, no disturbance in the dust beyond normal movement." Cornelius adjusted his spectacles. "That suggests the petrification happened without resistance. Which means either Demos did not perceive the attack until it was too late, or he did not recognize his attacker as a threat."

Xanthe's expression shifted slightly—curiosity breaking through anger.

Theo frowned. "He could have been surprised."

"Surprise requires sudden appearance. The Archives have one entrance. That entrance is visible from every position within the room. If a stranger entered, Demos would have seen them approach. If he saw them approach and continued filing rather than reacting, he must have known them and considered them safe."

"Or he was attacked from behind."

"Petrification requires eye contact. Attacking from behind is biologically non-functional."

Theo's frown deepened. "Then the attacker approached openly, and Demos made eye contact during normal conversation."

"Precisely. Which means the attacker had legitimate reason to be in the Archives, and Demos had no reason to suspect hostile intent." Cornelius began pacing, his tail creating a soft rhythm against stone. "Furthermore, the petrification was complete and even. There are no partial transformations, no inconsistencies in the stone composition. That indicates skilled, controlled application of magic. Not a panicked reflex. Not an emotional outburst. Surgical precision."

Xanthe unfolded her arms slowly. "You are saying this could not have been a crime of passion."

"I am saying the evidence suggests premeditation and discipline. The attacker knew how to petrify efficiently and did so without hesitation or error."

Theo crossed his arms, mirroring Xanthe's earlier posture. "That does not eliminate Xanthe as a suspect. It simply suggests she planned the attack rather than acting impulsively."

"It eliminates the theory that she attacked Demos in a fit of rage following their argument. Rage does not produce surgical precision. Rage produces excessive force, collateral damage, and visible emotional residue." Cornelius stopped pacing and faced Theo directly. "If Xanthe had petrified Demos in anger, the scene would reflect that anger. It does not."

"Thank you for that assessment." Xanthe's voice carried unexpected warmth. Not gratitude exactly, but acknowledgment.

Theo ignored her. "Your 'surgical precision' theory does not change the fundamental facts. Xanthe had motive. She had opportunity, assuming she is lying about her whereabouts. And she has the means—she is Gorgon."

"So is Kyra. So is every other Gorgon in the quarter. You cannot arrest someone based solely on species capability."

"I can question them based on motive, opportunity, and means. Which is exactly what I am doing."

Cornelius felt his tail lash once. Frustration—an unproductive emotion, but increasingly difficult to suppress. "You are confirming bias through selective evidence evaluation. Xanthe appears angry, therefore she fits your theory. Never mind that the crime scene contradicts impulsive rage. Never mind that dozens of individuals had access to the Temple that evening. Never mind that the sandalwood scent suggests planning and preparation inconsistent with spontaneous attack."

"The sandalwood could belong to Xanthe."

"Does it?" Cornelius turned to Xanthe. "Do you use sandalwood oil or incense?"

Xanthe blinked. "No. I work with leather. Sandalwood would interfere with the tanning scents. I avoid floral or spiced oils."

Cornelius looked back at Theo. "There. Elimination of one suspect through basic investigative questioning."

"Or a convenient lie."

"Then verify it. Visit her workspace. Confirm the absence of sandalwood. This is not complex methodology, Captain. It is basic forensic investigation."

Theo's jaw worked. The guards at the entrance maintained careful neutrality, though Cornelius suspected they were cataloging every word for later gossip at the Watch station.

Finally, Theo exhaled. "Fine. I will verify the sandalwood claim. But Xanthe remains a primary suspect until I have definitive proof otherwise."

"I have no objection to thorough investigation. I object to predetermined conclusions masquerading as investigation."

"Noted." Theo gathered his papers. "Xanthe, you are dismissed for now. Do not leave the city."

Xanthe stood. She looked at Cornelius, her expression unreadable. "Your cousin's fever," Cornelius said before she could leave. "Has her condition changed?"

The question clearly surprised her. "She is—" Xanthe paused. "The same. Neither better nor worse."

"The Temple's resources remain constrained. But if..." Cornelius adjusted his spectacles, uncomfortable with the sentiment but compelled to voice it. "If the charity book sale provides additional funding, treatment capacity should increase. It is not a solution. But it may be temporary relief."

Xanthe studied him. "You donated books."

"Forty-seven volumes. Against my better judgment and professional principles."

"But you did it anyway."

"Yes."

Something in Xanthe's expression softened. Not forgiveness—she did not owe him that—but perhaps recognition. "Then I hope they sell well, Drake."

She left, her footsteps fading into the square.

Theo waited until she was gone before speaking. "That was unnecessary."

"It was relevant information regarding resource allocation."

"It was sympathy. Which she will interpret as weakness."

"I do not particularly care how she interprets basic courtesy." Cornelius gathered his own notes. "What matters is the investigation. Which you are conducting with accelerating bias."

"I am conducting it according to established protocols for petrification cases."

"Your protocols assume Gorgon hostility as default rather than investigating actual evidence." Cornelius moved toward the entrance. "The crime scene indicates planning, precision, and specific intent. Those characteristics narrow the suspect pool significantly. But you are ignoring them in favor of focusing on the suspect who best fits your existing assumptions."

"My assumptions are based on decades of law enforcement experience."

"Your assumptions are based on cultural prejudice codified into bureaucratic procedure." Cornelius stopped at the threshold, looking back at Theo. "Xanthe is angry. That does not make her guilty. Kyra is evasive. That does not make her guilty. Someone petrified Demos with surgical precision in a controlled environment. That makes them professional. Disciplined. And very likely someone you have not yet considered."

He left before Theo could respond, launching himself from the loggia steps into the open air above the square. The afternoon had progressed while he observed interrogations—the tiles below held accumulated warmth, creating thermal currents perfect for gliding.

Cornelius rode the currents toward the library, turning over the interrogations in his mind. Kyra hiding her passing treatments. Xanthe's justified rage at systemic discrimination. Theo's determination to find a convenient Gorgon suspect rather than the correct one.

And beneath all of it, the central question: who benefits from Demos being petrified and Gorgons being blamed?

The answer was not Xanthe, whose community would suffer from increased Watch scrutiny. Not Kyra, whose family reputation depended on maintaining social acceptance.

Someone else. Someone capable of precision. Someone with access to the Archives and knowledge of Demos's schedule.

Someone who wanted everyone looking at the Gorgons instead of looking at them.

Cornelius landed on the library windowsill and folded his wings. Through the glass, he could see Imelda shelving returns, her movements carrying the automatic efficiency of decades spent organizing chaos into order.

He needed to review the visitor logs again. Not just Gorgon visitors—all visitors. Every individual who had entered the Temple in the days before Demos's petrification.

The answer was there. Buried in names and times and routine documentation.

He simply had to find it before Theo arrested the wrong Gorgon and guaranteed that Demos remained stone forever.

# Chapter 4

"The coastal navigation treatise is not on the donation list."

Cornelius did not look up from the visitor log he was annotating. His claw moved steadily across the page, marking each Temple entry with methodical precision. "That is correct."

"I saw you pull it from the collection two days ago." Imelda's voice carried the particular quality of patience stretched thin. "You also removed the illuminated songbook, the Kyrian herbal, and the matched set of philosophical dialogues. None of them appear on the list you submitted."

"Those volumes are not appropriate for donation."

"They are extremely appropriate. They are valuable, desirable, and would generate significant funds for the Temple."

Cornelius finally looked up. Imelda stood beside the reference desk with her arms crossed, ink-stained fingers tapping against her sleeve. Behind her, the morning light filtering through the library's high windows created geometric patterns across the tile floor—a detail Cornelius registered and immediately dismissed as irrelevant to the current confrontation.

"The coastal navigation treatise is the only complete copy in the city," Cornelius said. "Selling it would create a permanent gap in the collection."

"The Temple needs medical supplies. That is not a gap. That is people dying."

"People die regardless of whether I donate books. Medical supplies provide temporary relief. Knowledge is permanent."

"Knowledge is useless if there is no one left alive to read it."

Cornelius's tail twitched. He returned his attention to the visitor log, searching for anything that might have been overlooked during his first three reviews. The entries were frustratingly mundane: patients seeking treatment, families visiting the ill, merchants delivering supplies. Nothing suspicious. Nothing that pointed to a skilled Gorgon with access to the Archives and a supply of sandalwood oil.

"You are attempting to distract me with investigative busyness," Imelda observed. "It will not work. I want those books."

"You have forty-seven books. That exceeds most donation expectations."

"You promised fifty."

"I provided what I could spare."

"No. You provided what you could bear to part with. There is a difference."

Footsteps on the stairs announced Zeph's arrival before his voice did. "Hey, so I checked the—whoa. Are we fighting? We sound like we're fighting."

"We are having a professional disagreement," Cornelius said.

"We are fighting," Imelda confirmed.

Zeph set a stack of returned volumes on the desk and leaned against it with the casual posture of someone settling in to observe drama. "What about?"

"Cornelius is hoarding books that should be donated to save lives."

"I am preserving irreplaceable texts that cannot be recovered once sold."

Zeph looked between them. "Okay, but like... people are more important than books, right?"

The silence that followed was profound enough that Cornelius heard the scratch of a mouse in the wall three shelves over.

"Of course people are more important," Cornelius said finally. "In abstract. But the specific calculation is more complex than simple moral arithmetic."

"No it isn't." Zeph picked up one of the returned books and examined its spine. "Someone's dying. You have stuff that could help. You give them the stuff. That's not complex."

"The inevitable heat death of our sun is also not complex when reduced to simplified terms. That does not make the underlying physics any less intricate."

"Did you just compare selling books to the sun exploding?"

"I compared reductive reasoning to—" Cornelius stopped. Arguing with Zeph was like trying to catalog smoke. "Never mind. What did you discover when you checked the records I requested?"

Zeph set down the book. "Right. So, I went through the Temple donation logs like you asked. The big families—Kallistos, Doukas, Veneti—they all used to give a lot. Like, a *lot* a lot. But starting about six months ago, everything just drops off."

"I am aware. The question is why."

"Yeah, that's the weird part. I asked around—carefully, like you said—and nobody really knows. People just say the families are 'having troubles' or 'managing internal affairs' or whatever vague rich-people excuses sound good." Zeph pulled a folded paper from his pocket and smoothed it on the desk. "But I did find something interesting. Look at the Temple expense reports for the same period."

Cornelius leaned forward, adjusting his spectacles. The paper contained Zeph's handwriting—messy but legible—arranged in two columns. Income dropping steadily. Expenses remaining constant until three months ago, then spiking dramatically.

"What caused the spike?" Imelda asked, moving to examine the figures.

"Medicine purchases." Zeph pointed to a series of entries. "They're buying way more supplies than normal, but they're still running out. Which doesn't make sense unless—" He paused, frowning. "Unless someone's stealing them. Or using them way faster than they should."

Cornelius studied the numbers. The pattern was clear: increased expenditure without corresponding increase in documented patient treatment. Either the record-keeping was catastrophically incompetent, or supplies were being diverted.

Theft was possible. But theft usually showed up as missing inventory, not purchased-and-depleted inventory.

"There is another explanation," Cornelius said slowly. "The supplies are being used exactly as purchased, but not within the official clinic framework."

Imelda's eyes narrowed. "You think someone at the Temple is running an unauthorized treatment program."

"I think someone was providing care to patients who could not afford the official fees." Cornelius tapped the expense column. "The Temple operates on a cost-recovery model. Patients pay for treatment. Those fees fund supply purchases. But if someone began treating patients without collecting fees, the supply depletion would continue while income dropped."

"That's charity," Zeph said. "That's just... being a good person."

"That is also financial mismanagement that would bankrupt an institution already facing reduced patron donations."

"Wait." Zeph straightened. "You think Demos was doing this? You think he was secretly treating people for free and that's why the Temple's broke?"

Cornelius considered. Demos handled the Archives. Demos managed filing. Demos had access to patient records and supply inventories. Demos worked late, often alone, with minimal supervision.

Demos had been exhausted during his confrontation with Xanthe. Dark circles under his eyes. The haunted look of someone carrying impossible weight.

"It fits the available evidence," Cornelius said.

"It's more than that." Zeph leaned forward, his expression shifting from casual to serious. "I heard something else. One of the clinic regulars—old Yiayia Despina, you know her—she was talking to Cassius at the bakery this morning. She said Demos used to show up at people's houses after dark. People in the Gorgon quarter mostly. He'd bring medicine and treat people who couldn't come to the Temple. He never charged them."

The library went quiet. Somewhere above them, the building settled with a soft creak of old timber.

"That is not financially sustainable," Cornelius said.

"No. But it's good." Zeph's voice carried unexpected intensity. "It's actually good. Like, genuinely trying to help people good."

Cornelius looked down at the visitor log. At the neat handwriting marking Temple entries. At the careful records of a system stretched beyond capacity.

Demos had not been a gatekeeper enforcing cruel triage. Demos had been trying to treat everyone despite impossible constraints. He had been spending Temple resources—against policy, against sustainability, against his own exhausted capacity—because people were suffering and he could not sit idle while they did.

And Cornelius had dismissed him as a bureaucrat enforcing rules.

"Oh," Cornelius said quietly.

Imelda placed a hand on his shoulder. "Yes. Oh."

Cornelius removed his spectacles and cleaned them with meticulous care, buying time to organize his thoughts. The revelation reorganized every assumption. Demos was not a villain maintaining systemic neglect. He was the person standing between that system and complete collapse. He was the temporary relief Cornelius had dismissed as insufficient.

He was exactly the kind of person Cornelius should have recognized and valued.

"I need to revise my assessment," Cornelius said finally, replacing his spectacles.

"Of the case?" Zeph asked.

"Of everything." Cornelius stood, his claws clicking against the tile as he moved toward the restricted section where he had hidden the most valuable volumes. "Demos was not enforcing triage to deny care. He was enforcing it publicly while undermining it privately. He was trying to preserve the system while also subverting it for individual mercy."

"That's basically what you do with library rules," Zeph observed. "You're super strict about everything except when you're secretly not."

"That is a completely different—" Cornelius stopped. It was not different. Not really. He enforced cataloging standards with absolute rigor while simultaneously creating private exceptions for specific patrons he deemed worthy. He locked the rare book room while covertly sharing texts with researchers who demonstrated genuine need.

He hoarded books while claiming it was about preservation when it was actually about control.

"I am not heroic," Cornelius said.

"Nobody said you were." Imelda followed him toward the restricted section. "But you could be helpful."

Cornelius reached the shelf where he had hidden the coastal navigation treatise. He pulled it down, the leather binding smooth and familiar against his claws. A beautiful volume. Irreplaceable. Worth significant coin at the charity sale.

Worth how many vials of medicine? How many bandages? How many late-night house calls to fevered children in the Gorgon quarter?

He set the book on the cart designated for donations.

"The navigation treatise," Imelda noted. "You are certain?"

"No. But certainty is a luxury I apparently cannot afford." Cornelius reached for the illuminated songbook next. The gold leaf caught the light, creating small bright reflections across the shelf. "How much will these generate?"

"Enough to keep the Temple operational for perhaps two weeks. Maybe three if supplies are managed carefully."

"Temporary relief."

"Yes."

"For permanent loss of irreplaceable texts."

"Also yes."

Cornelius added the songbook to the cart. The Kyrian herbal. The philosophical dialogues. Each addition felt like removing scales from his hide—necessary but fundamentally wrong.

Zeph appeared beside the cart, examining the growing stack. "This is good. Like, this is actually really good of you."

"It is pragmatic resource allocation in service of investigation." Cornelius pulled another volume from the hidden collection. A treatise on ancient governance structures. He had been keeping it for personal reading. "If Demos dies because I withheld funds that might have prevented his petrification, I will have failed both professionally and morally."

"You're allowed to just say you want to help people."

"I am not helping people. I am preventing a specific negative outcome that would reflect poorly on my judgment."

"Right. Sure. That's definitely what this is." Zeph's tone suggested he believed the exact opposite.

Imelda began sorting the new donations, creating subcategories by subject and estimated value. Her hands moved with practiced efficiency, decades of library work translating into automatic expertise.

"Seventy-three books," she said after several minutes. "This puts us significantly above the original target. The Temple can stretch this for a month if they prioritize carefully."

"They will not prioritize carefully. Demos will recover and immediately resume his unauthorized charity program, depleting resources faster than sustainable."

"Probably."

"Which means this sacrifice is ultimately futile."

"Probably."

"So why does it feel necessary?"

Imelda looked up from her sorting. "Because futile is not the same as worthless. Temporary relief is still relief. Demos bought people time. Now you are buying him time. The arithmetic is clear."

Cornelius's tail curled around his feet. The library felt different somehow. Lighter. As though removing the hidden books had reduced actual weight rather than simply moral burden.

"I am not Demos," he said.

"No. You are Cornelius. Which means you will approach helping people as though it is a complex cataloging problem requiring meticulous attention to detail and excessive internal grumbling." Imelda smiled. "That is acceptable. Different people contribute differently."

"I still think the permanent loss of knowledge is a tragedy."

"It is. But so is the permanent loss of people. You are simply choosing which tragedy to prevent."

Zeph cleared his throat. "So, uh, speaking of people who might need preventing from becoming tragedies—I heard another thing at the bakery this morning."

Cornelius turned. "What thing?"

"Cassius was talking to one of the Enclave messengers. Apparently Mother Ligeia has been acting weird lately. Like, weirder than normal weird. She's been keeping someone hidden in the Enclave. Someone she's protecting really carefully."

"Who?"

"Nobody knows for sure. But people are calling her 'the Flower.'" Zeph glanced between Cornelius and Imelda. "I figured that was probably relevant? Given the whole mysterious Gorgon situation?"

Cornelius's mind immediately began sorting possibilities. A protected individual in the Gorgon Enclave. Someone important enough for the blind matriarch to hide personally. Someone whose identity was valuable enough to obscure with metaphor.

"The Flower," he repeated.

"Yeah. I don't know what it means, but it definitely sounds like a mystery thing."

"It sounds like the next investigative priority." Cornelius moved back toward the reference desk, his earlier malaise replaced by the familiar comfort of having a specific problem to solve. "I need to speak with Mother Ligeia."

"Good luck with that," Zeph said. "She doesn't really do conversations. She does cryptic pronouncements and then stares at you until you leave."

"Then I will interpret cryptic pronouncements. I am a librarian. Obscure reference interpretation is literally my profession."

Imelda began loading the donated books onto a larger cart. "I will deliver these to the Temple and ensure they are properly cataloged for the sale. You focus on the investigation."

"The investigation that is rapidly expanding beyond simple petrification into community conspiracy and hidden Gorgons."

"All investigations expand. That is their nature." Imelda paused with her hand on the cart handle. "Cornelius. What you did just now—donating the hidden books—that was difficult. I recognize that."

"It was logical resource allocation."

"It was sacrifice. You are allowed to acknowledge it as such."

Cornelius adjusted his spectacles, uncomfortable with the sentiment. "Acknowledgment does not change the outcome."

"No. But it changes you." Imelda pushed the cart toward the stairs. "Which is sometimes more important."

She descended, the cart wheels creating a steady rhythm against stone steps. Zeph lingered by the desk, fidgeting with a loose thread on his sleeve.

"You really think the Flower thing is connected?" Zeph asked.

"I think everything is connected until proven otherwise. That is the fundamental assumption of competent investigation." Cornelius pulled his notebook from his satchel and began a new page. "Protected Gorgon. Hidden identity. Timing coincident with Demos's petrification and Temple financial crisis. The pattern is too precise to be coincidental."

"So we're going to the Enclave?"

"I am going to the Enclave. You are staying here to monitor library operations."

"That's just code for 'I don't want you involved in the dangerous stuff.'"

"Correct. I do not want you involved in dangerous situations you are unqualified to navigate."

Zeph's expression shifted into something stubborn. "I found out about the Flower. I've been helping with research all morning. I'm already involved."

"Involvement in research is categorically different from involvement in field investigation within a community experiencing heightened social tension and potential criminal conspiracy."

"You just don't want to admit you're worried about me."

Cornelius paused. He was worried. Zeph was sixteen, enthusiastic, and fundamentally decent—all qualities that would serve him poorly if Mother Ligeia decided to demonstrate why she commanded the Gorgon Enclave's absolute loyalty despite her blindness and advanced age.

"I am concerned about optimal resource deployment," Cornelius said.

"Right. Resources. That's me. A resource you're deploying by making me stay here and reshelve returns."

"Precisely."

Zeph sighed but did not argue further. He picked up the stack of returned books and moved toward the shelves. "Fine. But when you get back, you're telling me everything. No edited-for-safety summaries."

"Agreed."

"And if you get petrified, I'm telling Imelda you were hoarding even more books than the ones you just donated."

"I was not—" Cornelius stopped. He had been. Several volumes remained hidden behind the eastern archive shelves, too precious even in his newly enlightened state to risk donation. "That is blackmail."

"Yep. Don't get petrified."

Cornelius gathered his notebook, pencils, and a small vial of lavender oil—the latter being a library staple he optimistically hoped might serve as olfactory comparison to the sandalwood found at the crime scene. He paused at the library entrance, looking back at the reading room.

His hoard. His sanctuary. His carefully maintained system of order and preservation.

And now, slightly diminished. Books scattered to the world beyond his control, supporting people rather than simply cataloging them.

It felt wrong.

But it also felt, in ways he could not quite articulate, more correct than anything he had done in months.

"Do not burn down the library while I am gone," Cornelius said.

"No promises," Zeph called back.

Cornelius spread his wings and launched himself from the entrance toward the older quarter of the city where the Gorgon Enclave maintained their careful, separate peace.

Somewhere in those narrow streets, Mother Ligeia was protecting someone called the Flower.

And Cornelius intended to discover exactly why that protection felt like the key to everything.

# Chapter 5

# Chapter 5

The library bell system rarely malfunctioned. Cornelius had personally maintained it for sixty-three years, cleaning mechanisms and adjusting tensions with the same care he applied to manuscript restoration. So when the civic alarm began clanging—not the gentle chime signaling hours but the harsh, repetitive sequence reserved for emergencies—he knew immediately that something fundamental had broken in the city's administrative order.

He looked up from his preparations for the Enclave visit. His satchel lay open on the reference desk, organized with notebook, pencils, and reference materials. The vial of lavender oil sat beside it, ready for olfactory comparison. Everything arranged with methodical precision.

The alarm continued. Three beats. Pause. Three beats. Pause.

Assembly summons. Mandatory civic attendance.

Cornelius moved to the window. Below, citizens were emerging from shops and homes, drawn toward the central square like iron filings responding to lodestone. The movement carried the particular quality of confusion—people knew they had to attend but not why.

"Is that the alarm?" Zeph appeared at the top of the stairs, arms full of returned volumes. "Like, the actual emergency alarm? I thought that was just for fires and invasions."

"Or civic emergencies requiring immediate community response." Cornelius abandoned his satchel and moved toward the entrance. "Which apparently includes whatever the Council has decided warrants disrupting commerce and daily operations."

"Should I come?"

"Attendance is mandatory for all citizens above the age of fourteen."

"Cool. Let me just—" Zeph dumped the books on the nearest reading table with a thud that made Cornelius's scales prickle. "I'll reshelve those later."

They descended together, Cornelius gliding from the entrance stairs while Zeph jogged to keep pace. The square was filling rapidly. Cornelius recognized the usual town fixtures—Cassius from the bakery, Yiayia Despina with her walking stick, merchants still wearing their work aprons. The crowd arranged itself in loose concentric circles around the Council platform, a raised stone dais normally used for official proclamations and seasonal festivals.

Four Council members stood on the platform. Captain Theo flanked them, his Watch uniform precisely pressed despite the late hour. His expression carried the particular neutrality of someone enforcing policy he had not authored but would implement regardless.

Councilor Philippos stepped forward. He was a broad man, his formal robes straining slightly across his chest. His voice carried the practiced projection of someone accustomed to public speaking.

"Citizens. Thank you for your prompt attendance. The Council has made a decision regarding the recent assault on Brother Demos and the ongoing investigation."

Cornelius felt his tail curl tighter around his feet. The phrasing was ominous. Not an update. A decision.

"The petrification of a Temple healer represents a direct threat to community safety and public order," Philippos continued. "After consultation with Captain Theo and the Temple leadership, the Council has determined that exceptional measures are required to secure the perpetrator and prevent additional attacks."

Murmurs rippled through the crowd. Cornelius saw Kyra standing near the fountain, her posture rigid. Several other Gorgons clustered together near the market stalls, their expressions wary.

"Effective immediately, the Council is implementing a mandatory registration and supervision protocol for all Gorgon citizens." Philippos gestured to Theo. "Captain Theo will coordinate the process. All Gorgons are required to report to the Watch station for documentation and assignment of movement restrictions until the investigation concludes."

The murmurs became louder. Cornelius heard fragments—"not right" and "what restrictions" and "they cannot do that."

Apparently they could.

"This is a temporary security measure," Philippos said, raising his voice slightly. "Once the perpetrator is identified and Brother Demos is restored, normal civic operations will resume. Until then, compliance is mandatory. Failure to register will result in detention."

Xanthe's voice cut through the crowd noise. "You are calling it registration. The rest of us recognize it as a roundup."

Philippos's expression hardened. "It is a lawful exercise of Council emergency authority."

"It is collective punishment based on species. We have names for that in history texts. None of them are complimentary."

"The Council is not interested in historical debate. We are interested in public safety." Philippos gestured to Theo again. "Captain, please explain the procedural details."

Theo stepped forward. His gaze swept the crowd, pausing briefly on Cornelius before moving on. "Registration will begin at dawn tomorrow. Gorgon citizens report to the Watch station with identification documents. You will be assigned a supervisor who will approve all movements outside designated residential areas. Violations will result in immediate detention pending investigation."

"For how long?" Kyra's voice remained steady despite the tension visible in her shoulders. "How long does this restriction remain in effect?"

"Until the Council determines the threat has been neutralized."

"That is not an answer. That is indefinite detention disguised as safety protocol."

"That is emergency governance responding to magical assault." Theo's tone allowed no argument. "If you have complaints about Council procedure, file them through official channels. Until then, compliance is mandatory."

The crowd began fragmenting. Some citizens moved toward the Council platform with questions. Others retreated toward homes and businesses. The Gorgon cluster near the market stalls dispersed quickly, heads down, moving with the specific body language of people trying to avoid attention while seething with anger.

Cornelius remained stationary, processing implications. The roundup was legally questionable but procedurally enforceable. The Council technically possessed emergency authority for public safety threats. The definition of "threat" was elastic enough to justify nearly anything if framed properly.

And Melaina—the Flower, hidden somewhere in the Enclave—would be forced to register or become a fugitive.

Assuming she was capable of registration. The rumors suggested illness severe enough to require Mother Ligeia's personal protection. If Melaina could not physically present herself for registration...

The Watch would come looking.

Zeph appeared beside him. "That was messed up. That was really, really messed up."

"It was legally authorized civic emergency protocol."

"It was racist."

"Species-based rather than race-based, technically. Though the moral distinction is minimal." Cornelius turned away from the square. "We should return to the library."

"Shouldn't we—I don't know—protest or something? That's what you're supposed to do when the government does evil stuff, right?"

"Protest is a long-term civic engagement strategy. The roundup begins at dawn. That provides approximately twelve hours for alternative solutions." Cornelius spread his wings. "I need to reach the Enclave before Watch patrols begin enforcement sweeps."

"Right. Yeah. The Flower." Zeph hesitated. "You think Mother Ligeia will even talk to you now? She's going to be busy protecting everyone."

Cornelius did not have an answer that provided comfort. He launched himself toward the library, riding the thermal currents above the emptying square.

Behind him, the Council platform stood empty. The emergency had been declared. The protocols engaged.

And somewhere in the Gorgon quarter, a sick child faced the choice between exposure and hiding.

Cornelius had nearly reached the library entrance when he saw Zeph running up the street below, waving frantically.

He circled back, landing on the entrance steps. "What is wrong?"

Zeph skidded to a stop, breathing hard. "Changed my mind. I'm coming with you to the Enclave."

"Absolutely not. The situation is now significantly more dangerous than—"

"I'm not asking permission. I'm telling you I'm coming." Zeph's expression carried unexpected steel. "You said people need help. The Flower needs help. I can help."

"You can help by remaining safely at the library and maintaining normal operations."

"The library doesn't need maintaining right now. People do." Zeph crossed his arms. "Also, you're bad at talking to scared people. You do the whole 'logical analysis of your emotional distress' thing and it makes everything worse. I'm better at that."

"I am perfectly capable of—" Cornelius stopped. He was not particularly capable of comforting frightened individuals. His communication style prioritized information transfer over emotional validation. "Your point has limited merit."

"So I'm coming."

Cornelius's tail lashed once. The argument was valid but the risk remained unacceptable. Zeph was sixteen, unaware of his Lamassu heritage, and fundamentally unprepared for confrontation with Watch enforcement or Enclave politics.

Before Cornelius could formulate an adequately discouraging response, movement at the end of the street caught his attention.

Zeph walking toward them.

That made no sense. Zeph stood directly in front of him, still breathing hard from his run. The approaching figure could not also be Zeph unless—

Cornelius adjusted his spectacles. The approaching figure walked with Zeph's particular loose-limbed gait but moved more slowly, supported by—

No. Supporting someone else.

As they drew closer, details resolved. Zeph—the actual Zeph standing before him—turned and went rigid.

"Oh no."

The approaching pair emerged into the library's entrance lantern light. A second Zeph supported a Gorgon girl who looked barely older than him. She wore a simple tunic and leaned heavily against him, her movements suggesting significant physical distress. Her serpent hair hung limp, responding to her weakened state with minimal animation.

Zeph—the genuine article standing beside Cornelius—ran toward them. "What are you doing here?"

The second Zeph did not answer because the second Zeph was not Zeph at all. As Cornelius watched, the features rippled and reformed into someone else entirely—a young man with similar build but different face, different coloring, different everything.

Shapeshifter.

The disguised individual helped the Gorgon girl settle onto the library steps. "She can't do the registration. She can barely walk. I thought—" He looked at actual-Zeph. "You said the library was safe. You said the dragon helped people."

"I said Cornelius *might* help. I didn't say bring her here while the Watch is literally organizing a roundup." Zeph crouched beside the girl. "Are you okay?"

She did not answer. Her eyes were half-closed, her breathing shallow.

Cornelius descended the steps slowly, maintaining non-threatening body language. The shapeshifter watched him with obvious wariness.

"Who are you?" Cornelius asked.

"Niko. I'm—" The young man glanced at the Gorgon girl. "I'm trying to help."

"By impersonating my intern and bringing an unregistered Gorgon to the most public building in the civic quarter?"

"I didn't know where else to go. Mother Ligeia said—" Niko stopped, recalibrating. "She said we had to get Melaina out before the Watch started searching properly. Said there was a dragon who understood preservation."

Melaina. The Flower.

Cornelius moved closer, examining the girl's condition with the clinical detachment he applied to damaged manuscripts. Pale skin—unusual for Gorgons, who typically maintained warmth-adapted complexions. Trembling despite the evening's moderate temperature. Serpent hair moving in slow, uncoordinated patterns suggesting neurological distress.

And beneath the visible symptoms, something else.

A scent.

Subtle. Familiar. Wrong.

Cornelius leaned closer, identifying the fragrance components with the trained precision of someone who spent decades cataloging ancient texts by their preservation methods.

Sandalwood.

The same scent from the Archives. From the space beside Demos's petrified body.

Cornelius went absolutely still.

Melaina—this sick, trembling child—carried the perpetrator's signature.

"Cornelius?" Zeph's voice carried concern. "What's wrong?"

Everything. Everything was wrong. The Flower was not a victim requiring rescue. The Flower was evidence. Possibly the weapon itself. The sandalwood connected her directly to the crime scene, to Demos's petrification, to—

He looked at Melaina's pallid face. Her half-conscious state. The way she struggled to breathe.

Or.

Or she was both.

"Get inside," Cornelius said quietly. "Quickly. Before someone sees."

Niko and Zeph exchanged glances. Zeph spoke first. "You're helping?"

"I am making a calculation regarding acceptable risk versus moral obligation. The calculation is incomplete but time-sensitive." Cornelius moved toward the entrance. "Bring her to the lower stacks. The eastern section behind the historical archives."

Where he kept the hidden books.

Where the tiles lifted and the walls had hollow spaces perfect for concealment.

Zeph helped Niko support Melaina up the steps. The girl moved like someone operating beyond exhaustion, body functioning through pure survival instinct. Cornelius led them through the main reading room—mercifully empty at this hour—and down the stairs to the lower levels.

The historical archives occupied the library's oldest section. Stone walls a yard thick. Temperature controlled by earth insulation rather than magical intervention. Shelves built during the city's founding, designed to last centuries rather than decades.

And behind those shelves, carefully concealed gaps where Cornelius stored the volumes he could not bear to catalog publicly.

His hoard.

Now, apparently, his illegal sanctuary for fugitive Gorgons who smelled like crime scenes.

"Here." Cornelius indicated the eastern corner where three shelves met at awkward angles, creating a natural alcove. He pressed specific stones in sequence—a combination he had never shared with anyone—and heard the mechanical click of the release mechanism.

The center shelf swung outward on hidden hinges, revealing a space approximately six feet deep and four feet wide. Books lined the walls in neat stacks. Rare treatises. Irreplaceable manuscripts. His secret preservation project spanning six decades.

Zeph stared. "You have a hidden room full of books."

"I have a climate-controlled storage space for volumes requiring special protection."

"You have a dragon hoard behind a secret door."

"The terminology is irrelevant. Help settle her inside."

Niko and Zeph guided Melaina into the space. She curled immediately into the corner, pulling her knees to her chest. Her serpent hair coiled around her shoulders in a defensive posture.

Cornelius noted her positioning. She had chosen the corner despite multiple options. Prey behavior. Injured-animal instinct to protect vulnerable areas while maintaining visual access to threats.

Not the behavior of a confident perpetrator.

But absolutely the behavior of someone central to whatever actually happened in the Archives.

"She needs water," Cornelius said. "And medical assessment, which I am unqualified to provide. But water first."

Zeph ran back toward the stairs. Niko remained, perched awkwardly in the hidden room's entrance.

"Thank you," Niko said quietly. "I know this is—I know you're taking a risk."

"I am taking several risks, including harboring an unregistered individual during civic emergency protocols, obstructing investigation, and providing sanctuary to someone who potentially petrified a Temple healer." Cornelius adjusted his spectacles. "The sandalwood scent suggests direct connection to the crime scene."

Niko's expression shifted into something complicated. Not surprise. Recognition.

"You know," Cornelius said. Not a question.

"I—" Niko looked at Melaina. "It's not what you think."

"I think very little at this stage. I observe and catalogue facts. Currently, the facts indicate logical cause for Watch detention and formal interrogation."

"She's dying."

The blunt statement sat between them like a physical object.

"From what?" Cornelius asked.

"Nobody knows. She just—it started two weeks ago. Fever first, then weakness, then this." Niko gestured to Melaina's curled form. "Mother Ligeia tried everything. Temple remedies, traditional Enclave medicine, every healer she could find. Nothing works. The fever keeps rising and Melaina keeps fading."

Two weeks. Demos had been running secret charity treatments. Demos had been visiting the Gorgon quarter at night.

"Did Demos treat her?" Cornelius asked.

Niko hesitated, then nodded. "Three times. He was trying to stabilize the fever. But it wasn't working, and he said she needed Temple facilities for proper diagnosis. Tests he couldn't do from a bag."

"When was his last visit?"

"The night before—" Niko stopped. His expression confirmed what Cornelius had already deduced.

"The night before he was petrified."

"Yes."

Footsteps on the stairs announced Zeph's return. He carried a clay pitcher and cup, moving carefully to avoid spills. "Got water. Also grabbed some bread in case she can eat."

Melaina took the cup with shaking hands. She drank three small sips before setting it aside, the effort apparently exhausting her remaining strength.

Cornelius watched her. Seventeen years old according to the intelligence Zeph had gathered. Barely older than Zeph himself. Sick enough that walking required assistance. Fragile enough that persecution would likely accelerate whatever was already consuming her.

And carrying the perpetrator's scent.

The library bell chimed the hour. Somewhere above them, the city continued its evening routines. Citizens securing homes. Watch preparing patrol schedules. The Council's roundup machinery organizing for dawn implementation.

And here, in the oldest part of the library, Cornelius faced a choice.

Report Melaina and potentially solve the case while guaranteeing her detention during active illness.

Or hide her and become complicit in obstruction.

His entire professional existence had been built on order, rules, proper procedure. He catalogued. He preserved. He maintained systems designed to  last beyond individual lives or temporary crises.

He did not harbor fugitives.

He looked at the stacks of hidden books surrounding Melaina. Volumes he had kept secret for decades, hoarded against imagined future losses. Knowledge preserved so carefully it served no one.

Demos had not preserved. Demos had spent. Medicine, time, his own exhausted capacity—all deployed without regard for sustainability because people needed help immediately, not theoretically.

And now Demos was stone.

Possibly because of Melaina. Possibly because of something that connected to Melaina. The details remained unclear.

But the child before him—sick, frightened, hunted—was definitely and immediately in danger.

"She stays," Cornelius said.

Zeph's relief was visible. "Really?"

"Temporarily. Until I determine actual circumstances and appropriate action." Cornelius moved toward the hidden room's entrance. "Close the door behind me. The mechanism locks from outside. I will return at dawn."

"Where are you going?" Niko asked.

"To retrieve medical supplies from the Temple stores while the charity sale is being catalogued. If Melaina is dying, hiding her is insufficient. We need to address the dying part."

"That's stealing."

"Correct. Add it to my expanding list of criminal activities this evening." Cornelius stepped back into the archives proper. "Neither of you leave this section. If anyone comes looking, you are researching historical building records for a civic architecture project. Zeph is documented as authorized for archive access. Niko—if questioned—is a consulting specialist from the Builders' Guild."

Zeph nodded. Niko still looked uncertain.

Cornelius moved toward the stairs, then paused. "The sandalwood. Where did it come from?"

Niko met his gaze steadily. "Sister Photine. She brought medicine in a sandalwood chest when she came to examine Melaina. Said it would help preserve the fever treatments."

Sister Photine.

Head Temple Healer. Demos's supervisor. The person Kyra had visited for passing consultations. The individual who had shown visceral terror and grief at Demos's petrification.

The person who had access to the Archives, to Demos's schedule, to Temple resources and records.

Cornelius felt pieces shifting in his understanding, patterns reforming into new configurations.

"Stay hidden," he said again. "I will return."

He climbed the stairs with his mind racing through implications and connections. Photine and Melaina. Photine and the sandalwood. Photine's fear preceding Demos's petrification, suggesting she knew something terrible was coming.

Or had already done something terrible.

He reached the main reading room and stopped.

Heavy footsteps outside. Multiple individuals approaching with the particular rhythm of coordinated movement.

Cornelius moved to the window.

Six Watch guards arranged themselves at the library's entrance. Captain Theo stood at their center, a document scroll in hand.

They climbed the entrance steps. Theo raised his hand toward the door.

And knocked.

The sound echoed through the library like thunder, formal and inevitable.

Cornelius looked back toward the stairs descending to the archives. To the hidden room. To the fugitive Gorgon child surrounded by his secret hoard.

The knocking came again. Louder. Insistent.

"This is Captain Theo Melas of the City Watch. Open for official inspection."

Cornelius smoothed his scales and moved toward the entrance.

The game, it seemed, had fundamentally changed.

# Chapter 6

# Chapter 6

The Temple of Althaia occupied three full blocks in the civic quarter, its whitewashed walls reflecting morning light with aggressive brightness. Cornelius landed on the perimeter wall and folded his wings against the glare. The building's architecture prioritized visibility and cleanliness—wide windows, open courtyards, surfaces designed for easy scrubbing. Every tile gleamed. Every corner appeared recently inspected.

It made his scales itch.

He had managed to deflect Captain Theo's inspection through a combination of bureaucratic procedure and strategic misdirection. The Watch possessed authority to search public spaces, certainly, but the library's historical archives qualified as restricted civic property requiring Council authorization beyond simple Watch mandate. Cornelius had produced three separate municipal codes supporting this position while standing in the entrance doorway, physically blocking access to the stairs and radiating the particular stubbornness that came from one hundred twenty-seven years of defending territorial boundaries.

Theo had eventually retreated with poorly concealed frustration and a promise to return with proper authorization.

Which gave Cornelius approximately six hours before the Council convened for emergency session approval.

Six hours to investigate Photine, secure medical supplies, and determine whether the Head Healer was incompetent, complicit, or actively criminal.

He descended from the wall and entered through the main courtyard. The Temple's administrative entrance remained open despite the early hour—healing operated on continuous shifts rather than merchant schedules. A young acolyte looked up from the registry desk, his expression shifting through surprise, concern, and professional neutrality in rapid succession.

"Cornelius Drake, City Librarian," Cornelius announced. "I require access to Sister Photine regarding the ongoing investigation into Brother Demos's assault."

The acolyte consulted his records. "Sister Photine is currently managing the infirmary. I can send word—"

"That will not be necessary. I am familiar with Temple layout." Cornelius moved past the desk before the acolyte could formulate objection. The advantage of civic position and species-based intimidation: people rarely argued with a dragon claiming institutional authority.

The path to the infirmary took him through the Temple's eastern corridor, which opened onto the street-level market district through a series of arched alcoves. Vendors had begun morning setup—produce stalls, fabric merchants, the inevitable book dealer who operated from a wheeled cart and consistently undersold library donation sales.

Cornelius intended to walk past without engagement. He had investigation to conduct and crimes to commit. Browsing market stalls would constitute irresponsible time allocation.

Then he saw the book.

It sat on the dealer's display board, spine upward, the leather binding worn but intact. Even from fifteen feet away, Cornelius recognized the title stamped in faded gilt: *Thalassan Tide Tables and Coastal Survey, Fourth Edition*.

The continuation of the navigation treatise he had just donated.

The book dealer—a weathered human named Petros who had been operating this corner for at least thirty years—noticed Cornelius's attention and smiled. "Morning, Cornelius. Picked this up from an estate sale in the port district. Thought you might be interested. Only twenty silver."

Twenty silver for a text that would complete the coastal navigation collection. Twenty silver to restore what he had sacrificed for Temple medical supplies.

Twenty silver that could instead purchase medicine.

Cornelius approached the cart. The book appeared properly maintained despite its age. He could see the careful stitching along the spine, the edge-marking that indicated frequent but respectful use. A scholar's copy. Something preserved by someone who understood its value.

"The binding is intact?" Cornelius asked.

"Completely. Some margin notes in the appendices, but clean script. Probably a harbor master's reference copy." Petros lifted the book and opened it to demonstrate. "See? Beautiful condition for something this old."

It was beautiful. And it was exactly the kind of permanent knowledge Cornelius had built his entire professional philosophy around preserving.

Imelda's voice echoed in his memory: *"Permanent loss of knowledge is a tragedy. But so is permanent loss of people."*

Cornelius stepped back from the cart. "I appreciate the offer, but I must decline."

Petros's surprise was evident. "You sure? I can hold it for you if you need to check library funds—"

"I am certain. The library's resources are currently allocated toward more immediate community needs." Cornelius turned away before the temptation could reassert itself. "If it remains unsold in three months, inquire again."

He continued toward the infirmary before Petros could respond. Behind him, he heard the book dealer's quiet sound of confusion.

The permanent loss of that knowledge would indeed be a tragedy if someone else purchased it and removed it from the city entirely.

But people were more important than books.

He was still trying to convince himself of this when he entered the infirmary.

The space smelled aggressively of lavender and antiseptic alcohol—scents deployed to mask the underlying reality of illness and bodily distress. Rows of beds lined both walls, separated by thin curtains that provided minimal privacy. Perhaps two-thirds of the beds were occupied. Cornelius noted the patient distribution: primarily elderly or very young. The working-age adults who could afford private healers were absent.

Triage in architectural form.

Sister Photine stood at the central preparation table, organizing supplies with mechanical precision. She wore her grey healer robes, the fabric crisp despite the early hour. Her dark hair was pulled back in a braid so tight it looked painful. Her hands moved constantly—sorting bandages, counting vials, rearranging instruments into geometric patterns.

She did not look up when Cornelius entered.

"Sister Photine," Cornelius said. "I need to speak with you regarding Brother Demos."

"Speak, then." She continued sorting. Glass vials clinked against each other as she transferred them from storage box to preparation tray. "I am listening while working. We are understaffed."

Cornelius moved closer, observing her process. She was organizing fever treatments—the same medicines Demos had apparently been distributing during unauthorized house calls. The vials contained liquid in varying amber shades: boneset tincture, willow bark suspension, chamomile concentrate.

Standard remedies. Nothing exotic or suspicious.

"When did you last see Brother Demos?" Cornelius asked.

"Three days ago. Morning shift. He completed his filing duties and departed at sunset." Her hands never stilled. Pick up vial. Examine label. Place in tray. Repeat. "I assumed he went home."

"You did not verify?"

"I am not his keeper. I am his supervisor. There is a distinction." She finished one tray and immediately began another. "Demos was an adult who managed his own schedule outside clinic hours."

"Did he mention any plans? Any patients requiring follow-up treatment?"

"No."

The answer came too quickly. Cornelius's tail curled. "You are certain?"

"I am certain he did not mention plans to me. What he did independently is not my concern unless it compromised clinic operations." Photine's hands trembled slightly as she reached for another vial. "Which it did. Continuously. His unauthorized charity work depleted our supplies while providing no cost recovery. It was professionally irresponsible regardless of intent."

"You knew about the unauthorized treatments?"

"Of course I knew. Demos was exhausted, supplies vanished, and patients from the Gorgon quarter began referencing 'the kind healer who visits at night.'" She set down three vials with excessive force. "I am not incompetent."

"Yet you did not stop him."

Photine finally looked up. Her eyes were bloodshot, the skin beneath them dark enough to suggest she had not slept properly in days. "Stop him how? Report him to Temple leadership and guarantee his dismissal? Force him to refuse treatment to dying children? What solution would you recommend, Librarian?"

The title carried accusation rather than respect.

Cornelius adjusted his spectacles. "I would recommend honesty regarding resource constraints and collaborative problem-solving with Temple administration."

"Temple administration cares about donations and patron relationships. They care about maintaining reputation with the Three Families. They do not care about—" She stopped. Her jaw worked as though physically restraining further comment. "I did what I could. I managed supply allocation to compensate for Demos's distributions. I covered his absences. I maintained operational continuity."

"While the clinic approached financial collapse."

"Yes." She returned to organizing vials. "While the clinic approached financial collapse. Because the alternative was watching people die of preventable illness while sitting on a stockpile of medicine we were 'preserving' for paying patients."

The parallel to Cornelius's own book-hoarding was uncomfortably precise.

He tried a different approach. "Did Demos mention treating anyone specifically? Someone whose condition was unusual or resistant to standard remedies?"

Photine's hands stopped moving. Just for a moment. Then resumed with increased speed. "No."

She was lying.

Cornelius could not identify the specific tells—Photine's baseline anxiety was too high for standard deception analysis—but the timing was wrong. The pause too calculated.

"What about you?" Cornelius asked. "Have you personally treated any Gorgon patients recently? Anyone requiring house calls or supplies delivered outside standard clinic protocol?"

"I treat many patients." She was arranging the vials by height now, creating a precisely graduated sequence. "I do not catalogue them by species."

"I am asking about unconventional treatment locations. Specifically, treatments requiring sandalwood preservation for transported medicines."

This time, the reaction was unmistakable. Photine's entire body went rigid. Her hand, reaching for another vial, trembled so violently that she knocked the container sideways.

It fell.

Glass shattered against tile with a sound like a small explosion. Amber liquid spread across the floor in a puddle that caught the light from the high windows.

Photine stared at the spill. Her breathing had gone rapid and shallow.

Then she moved.

She swept the entire tray of vials into the waste bin with a motion so violent that at least three more containers shattered. Glass fragments scattered across the floor. The sharp scent of mixed tinctures rose in a cloud.

"Contaminated," Photine said. Her voice had gone flat. "All contaminated. Cannot use contaminated supplies. Patient safety requires—"

She grabbed a scrub brush from the cleaning station and dropped to her knees beside the spill. She began scrubbing the tiles with frantic intensity, the brush bristles catching on grout lines and spreading the liquid rather than containing it.

Cornelius stepped back, uncertain whether to intervene. "Sister Photine. The spill is minor. It does not require—"

"Contamination spreads." She scrubbed harder. Her knuckles were white with pressure. "Invisible. Microscopic. One drop transfers to hands, hands to face, face to mucous membranes. Standard sanitation protocol requires complete decontamination of affected surfaces and disposal of any materials within splash radius."

She was reciting textbook procedure while destroying the floor's grouting.

"You are damaging the tiles," Cornelius observed.

"Tiles can be replaced. Infection cannot be unspread." The brush slipped and scraped across her knuckle, drawing blood. She did not appear to notice. "Do you understand? Once it transfers, it continues. Patient to healer. Healer to family. Family to community. Geometric progression until containment becomes impossible."

"What infection?" Cornelius asked carefully.

Photine stopped scrubbing. She stared at the tiles, at her bleeding hands, at the chemical-stained grout.

"Fever," she said finally. "Just fever. Standard autumn illness. Nothing unusual. I am simply—we are understaffed. Demos is gone and I am managing alone and standards must be maintained—"

She resumed scrubbing with renewed violence.

Cornelius watched her destroy her hands against stone and chemicals. The obsessive cleaning. The terror of contamination. The specific mention of geometric progression and community spread.

This was not standard medical caution.

This was someone managing a crisis in complete isolation.

"How many patients have this fever?" Cornelius asked.

"I do not track patterns. I treat symptoms." Scrub. Scrub. Blood mixed with antiseptic and tincture. "Each patient is individual. Drawing broader conclusions requires epidemiological analysis we are not equipped to—"

"How many?"

Photine's hands stilled. She remained kneeling on the floor, surrounded by glass shards and chemical residue, her professional composure eroded into something raw and desperate.

"Enough," she whispered. "Enough that I notice. Enough that Demos noticed. Enough that we started comparing notes about symptoms and progression and treatment resistance." She looked up at Cornelius. "Enough that when he said he would investigate the connection, I told him to be careful."

"What connection?"

"I do not know. He would not specify. He said speculation without evidence was irresponsible." She laughed, a sound like breaking glass. "Professional to the end. Even when conducting unauthorized research into potential plague patterns."

The infirmary door opened. An elderly patient shuffled in, supported by what appeared to be a grandchild. Photine's expression transformed instantly—the mania smoothing into professional neutrality, the terror masked beneath practiced competence.

She stood, brushing glass fragments from her robes. "Excuse me. I have patients requiring treatment."

She walked toward the new arrivals, her bloody hands hidden in her sleeves, her voice gentle and reassuring as she guided them toward an empty bed.

The transformation was complete. The terrified, obsessive healer vanished behind the mask of calm institutional authority.

Cornelius remained beside the contaminated floor, processing implications.

Demos had been investigating fever patterns.

Melaina had unexplained progressive fever.

Photine was terrified of infection spread and had been treating patients with supplies preserved in sandalwood.

The same sandalwood found at the petrification scene.

Movement near the infirmary entrance caught his attention. A figure stood in the archway, partially obscured by the decorative column.

Cornelius adjusted his spectacles, sharpening focus.

Kyra Kallistos. Watching Photine with the intensity of someone conducting surveillance rather than seeking treatment.

Their eyes met across the infirmary. Kyra's expression remained neutral, but her posture shifted—weight transferring to her back foot, preparing for withdrawal.

Cornelius moved toward her. "Miss Kallistos. I did not expect to encounter you at the Temple this morning."

By the time he reached the archway, she was gone.

Cornelius stepped into the corridor. Empty. The morning market continued its operations beyond the arches, vendors calling prices and customers negotiating purchases. The normal commerce of a city conducting business while emergency governance organized roundups and investigations proceeded toward uncertain conclusions.

No sign of Kyra in any direction.

He returned to the infirmary entrance and looked back at Photine. She was examining the elderly patient now, her movements gentle and methodical, her voice too quiet for Cornelius to hear specific words. The perfect image of a dedicated healer managing routine treatment.

Except her hands were still bleeding through her sleeves.

And Kyra was tracking her movements.

And somewhere in Cornelius's hidden archive, a sick Gorgon girl carried the same sandalwood signature that marked the crime scene where Demos had been transformed to stone.

The patterns were there. Connections forming between fever and petrification, between Photine's terror and Demos's investigation, between the official Temple operations and whatever secret treatment network had been operating in shadows.

He simply could not yet see the complete structure.

Cornelius left the infirmary and returned to the main corridor. The Temple's supply storage occupied the western wing—a secured area requiring authorized access. Normally, such authorization was strictly controlled.

But currently, the Temple was understaffed, Photine was managing the infirmary alone, and the charity book sale had diverted administrative attention toward inventory and logistics.

Which meant Cornelius had approximately thirty minutes to locate, appropriate, and conceal enough medical supplies to treat a dying teenager while avoiding detection by an institution he was simultaneously investigating and robbing.

He adjusted his spectacles and reviewed his mental catalogue of Temple layout.

Sometimes preservation required theft.

He was still not entirely comfortable with this evolution of his moral framework.

But comfort, like certainty, was apparently a luxury he could no longer afford.

# Chapter 7

"I require access to Mother Ligeia."

The Gorgon standing guard at the cistern entrance did not move. He was young—perhaps twenty—with serpent hair that coiled and uncoiled in patterns suggesting agitation rather than threat. His hand rested on a weighted club that had clearly seen recent sharpening.

"The Enclave is closed," he said. His voice carried the careful neutrality of someone delivering a memorized response. "Mother Ligeia is not receiving visitors."

Cornelius adjusted his spectacles and reassessed the entrance configuration. The cisterns occupied the oldest section of the city's water infrastructure—a network of stone tunnels and chambers that predated current street layouts by at least three centuries. The entrance descended through what appeared to be a abandoned wine merchant's cellar, the original purpose obscured by time and strategic Gorgon occupancy.

Two additional guards flanked the main passage, both armed. Their positioning suggested defensive preparation rather than casual security.

The roundup had clearly accelerated community fortification.

"I am investigating the assault on Brother Demos," Cornelius said. "Mother Ligeia possesses information relevant to the case. Her cooperation would be appreciated."

"The Enclave is closed to outside investigation." The young guard's serpent hair tightened around his shoulders. "We are managing our own security."

"By barricading against civic authority and preparing for armed confrontation?"

"By protecting our people from illegal detention protocols." The guard's expression hardened. "You want to question someone, take it up with Captain Theo. He seems eager to interrogate Gorgons."

Valid point. Theo's registration mandate had effectively positioned the Watch as adversary rather than protection. Any Gorgon cooperation with external investigators would be interpreted as collaboration with oppression.

Cornelius tried a different approach. "I am not Watch. I am not enforcing roundup protocols. I am attempting to restore Brother Demos—a healer who spent his final conscious hours treating Enclave residents without compensation."

The guard's posture shifted slightly. Not quite relaxation. More like recognition of complexity.

"Mother Ligeia knows this," he said finally. "She also knows that good intentions do not prevent bad outcomes. The Enclave stays closed until we determine our own safety." He gestured toward the passage behind him. "I can deliver a message if you have official business."

"My business is with Mother Ligeia directly."

"Then your business remains unfinished."

Cornelius considered forcing the issue. He was significantly larger than any of the guards and possessed both flight capacity and physical advantages inherent to draconic species. Pushing past them would be trivial from a purely mechanical standpoint.

It would also constitute assault, confirm every prejudice about predatory mythkin, and guarantee that the Enclave would never cooperate with any future inquiry.

He was calculating alternative strategies when movement deeper in the passage caught his attention.

A figure emerged from the shadows—tall, thin, moving with the particular careful grace of someone navigating memorized space without visual reference.

Mother Ligeia.

She wore simple grey robes that blended with the stone walls. Her serpent hair moved in slow, coordinated patterns, compensating for her blindness through motion-sensing and air displacement reading. Her face showed age through expression rather than deterioration—the kind of weathering that came from decades of leadership and impossible choices.

"Cornelius Drake." Her voice carried the texture of worn stone. "The dragon who preserves everything except common sense."

The young guard stepped aside immediately. Cornelius noted the absolute deference in the movement. Ligeia commanded loyalty that transcended simple respect.

"Mother Ligeia. I appreciate your willingness to speak with me."

"I did not say I was willing. I said I was present." She moved forward until she stood directly between Cornelius and the passage entrance. "You come to my home demanding access while your Council organizes roundups. You investigate assault while my people prepare for siege. Tell me, Librarian—do you practice such irony deliberately, or does it come naturally to your species?"

"I am not responsible for Council emergency protocols."

"Yet you benefit from them. You operate in their civic quarter, maintain their records, receive their institutional protections." Her serpent hair oriented toward him with unsettling precision. "You exist comfortably within systems of power and then claim neutrality when those systems turn violent."

Cornelius's tail curled against the stone floor. The accusation struck uncomfortably close to observations Imelda had made regarding his controlled distance from community suffering.

"I am attempting to prevent further violence by identifying the actual perpetrator rather than enabling collective punishment."

"How noble. The dragon defends us with investigation." Ligeia's expression remained neutral, but her serpent hair's movements suggested contempt. "Meanwhile, your Captain Theo sharpens his detention procedures and my children prepare weapons they should not need to own."

"Which is precisely why I require information about—"

"The Flower." Ligeia tilted her head. "You came seeking the Flower. Yes, I know. Information travels quickly in enclosed spaces." She smiled without humor. "But flowers require specific conditions to survive. Too much exposure kills as surely as drought. You understand preservation, Cornelius Drake. Surely you understand protection."

He did understand. He also understood that Melaina was currently hidden in his archive rather than the Enclave, which meant Ligeia's protective metaphors were defending empty space.

Unless there was another Flower. Another sick Gorgon the Enclave was sheltering.

"I need to know who Brother Demos treated in the days before his petrification," Cornelius said carefully. "Particularly anyone suffering from persistent fever resistant to standard remedies."

"Why?"

"Because Demos was investigating unusual fever patterns. Because his treatment network included Enclave residents. Because understanding his final cases may illuminate who attacked him and why."

Ligeia's serpent hair coiled tighter. "Or it may expose vulnerable people to Watch scrutiny and force them into registration protocols designed to control rather than protect."

"I am not sharing information with the Watch."

"You are not sharing information with anyone. Including me." She moved closer, her blindness not impeding her ability to position herself directly in Cornelius's sight line. "You come asking questions but offer no answers. You demand trust while harboring your own secrets. What are you protecting, Cornelius Drake? What have you hidden in your precious library that you would risk coming here while the Council sharpens its knives?"

His scales prickled. She could not possibly know about Melaina. Niko had brought the girl directly to the library under cover of darkness and Zeph's impersonation. No one had witnessed—

Except Ligeia commanded an intelligence network that had identified Cornelius as a potential ally before he had even made that determination himself. Information traveled quickly in enclosed spaces. And shapeshifters reported to someone.

"I am protecting investigation integrity," Cornelius said. "Which requires understanding the full scope of Demos's treatment activities."

"The full scope is that he cared when others did not. He treated fever, injury, infection—whatever presented itself. He did not maintain detailed records of unauthorized charity work because detailed records create evidence trails." Ligeia's expression hardened. "He protected his patients through obscurity. I will not undo that protection to satisfy your curiosity."

"Even if that obscurity enables whoever attacked him to remain unidentified?"

"Even then." She turned partially away, indicating dismissal. "The roots matter more than individual branches. I will not sacrifice the whole network to avenge one person, no matter how valued."

Footsteps echoed from the passage behind Ligeia. Cornelius looked past her and saw another figure approaching—this one carrying what appeared to be a canvas supply bag.

Kyra Kallistos.

She emerged from the deeper tunnels with the confident stride of someone navigating familiar territory. The bag she carried showed the distinctive green seal of the Temple's charity distribution program. Her expression shifted through surprise, calculation, and something resembling resignation when she saw Cornelius.

"Mother Ligeia." Kyra's tone carried careful respect. "I brought the supplies you requested. Bandages, fever treatments, dried—"

"I did not request supplies." Ligeia's voice remained pleasant, but her serpent hair oriented toward Kyra with unmistakable hostility. "I requested that you stop attempting to purchase absolution through charity donations."

Kyra stopped walking. "I am helping."

"You are performing. There is a difference." Ligeia moved toward her, somehow navigating the uneven stone floor without hesitation. "You bring Temple supplies to demonstrate civic connection. You deliver charity to prove worthiness. You perform compassion as though it were currency that could buy back what you have already sold."

"I have not—"

"You sold your reflection, Kyra Kallistos. You sold your face and your serpent hair and your truth." Ligeia's voice remained quiet, which somehow made it more devastating. "You trade authenticity for acceptance at whatever Temple altar currently offers the best price for your disguise. Do not come here pretending that bag of bandages restores what you have already abandoned."

Kyra's composure cracked. "I am still Gorgon. I am still—"

"You are whatever your current mirror shows you. Which changes depending on audience and advantage." Ligeia gestured toward the passage exit. "Take your supplies to whoever you are pretending to be this week. The Enclave does not accept charity from those who reject community except when it serves their reputation."

"The roundup affects me too. I still have to register. I still—"

"You will register as Gorgon to maintain legal status while passing as human to maintain social status. You will leverage both identities strategically while committing to neither authentically." Ligeia's serpent hair spread wide, creating a physical barrier between Kyra and the deeper tunnels. "You are not welcome here. Not your supplies. Not your performance. Not your carefully calculated gesture toward belonging."

Kyra stood motionless for several seconds. Her expression cycled through anger, shame, and something that looked uncomfortably like grief. Then she turned and walked toward the exit without responding.

She passed within three feet of Cornelius. Her eyes met his briefly. He saw exhaustion there. And recognition of someone else navigating between communities without full acceptance from either.

Then she was gone, footsteps echoing up the stone passage toward the cellar exit.

Ligeia waited until the sound faded completely before speaking. "You see? This is what your investigation protects. People who exploit crisis for personal advantage while abandoning collective responsibility."

"I was not investigating Kyra Kallistos."

"Perhaps you should. She visited Sister Photine three times in the past two weeks. Always at odd hours. Always alone." Ligeia's serpent hair resumed its slow scanning pattern. "But that would require questioning someone connected to the Three Families. Easier to interrogate Enclave residents who lack institutional protection."

Cornelius filed the Photine-Kyra connection for future analysis. "I interrogate whoever possesses relevant information regardless of social status."

"How admirably egalitarian. Tell me, does that principle apply to yourself?" Ligeia moved back toward the deeper passage. "Or do you maintain different standards for librarians harboring fugitives in climate-controlled archives?"

The accusation landed like a physical blow.

Cornelius went absolutely still. "I do not know what you mean."

"Of course not. Just like I do not know that Niko brought Melaina to your library last night. Just like I do not know that you are currently hiding her in the same secret room where you hoard banned texts and irreplaceable manuscripts." Ligeia smiled. "We are both protecting flowers, Cornelius Drake. The difference is that I admit it."

The silence stretched between them. The young guard near the entrance shifted uncomfortably but did not intervene.

Cornelius calculated his options. Denial was clearly futile. Ligeia's intelligence network exceeded his initial assessment. Attempting to negotiate might expose additional vulnerabilities.

He chose oblique honesty.

"If I were harboring someone," Cornelius said carefully, "it would be because they required immediate medical intervention unavailable through official channels."

"If I were directing someone to seek such harbor," Ligeia replied, "it would be because remaining in the Enclave exposed them to danger from multiple directions. Including well-intentioned investigators who might inadvertently reveal their location to authorities conducting species-based roundups."

They regarded each other across the dim passage. A negotiation conducted through conditional hypotheticals and strategic omission.

"The person you are not discussing," Cornelius continued, "would require specific medical treatment for progressive fever conditions. Understanding the source and nature of that illness might prevent additional cases."

"Or it might expose a pattern that certain powerful interests wish to remain hidden. Particularly if that pattern implicates Temple operations or Three Families politics." Ligeia's expression remained neutral. "Some investigations threaten roots more than individual branches."

"Meaning you believe Demos was attacked because of what he discovered. Not because of random criminal opportunity."

"Meaning I believe systems protect themselves when threatened with exposure. Medical systems. Economic systems. Power systems." She turned back toward the deeper tunnels. "Your hypothetical patient remains safer in deep archives than in shallow graves. Keep her hidden, Cornelius Drake. And stop asking questions that put targets on vulnerable backs."

She began walking away. Cornelius watched her navigate the passage with absolute confidence despite her blindness.

"Mother Ligeia. One more question."

She paused but did not turn around.

"Do you know who petrified Brother Demos?"

"I know who benefits from his silence. I know who profits from Gorgon scapegoating. I know who controls medical access and resource distribution." Her serpent hair coiled tight against her shoulders. "But knowing and proving are different categories. You taught me that yourself, years ago, when explaining why certain historical documents remain archived rather than publicly displayed."

She disappeared into the darkness, leaving Cornelius alone with the guards and his own uncomfortable recognition.

He had indeed taught that principle. Knowledge without actionable proof created danger rather than justice. Some truths remained archived precisely because exposing them would cause more harm than their concealment.

He was still processing implications when one of the guards coughed diplomatically.

"You should leave," the young man said. Not hostile. Almost sympathetic. "Mother Ligeia gave you what she could. Pressing for more helps no one."

Cornelius nodded and turned toward the exit passage. The stone walls pressed close, the air thick with moisture and the particular scent of ancient lichen growth. Behind him, he heard the guards resuming their defensive positions.

He was halfway up the passage when another figure emerged from a side chamber—this one he had not noticed during his entrance.

Xanthe.

She sat on a stone ledge, sharpening a blade across a whetstone with methodical precision. The scraping sound echoed off the walls. She did not look up when Cornelius stopped.

"Leaving so soon?" She tested the blade's edge against her thumb. "I thought librarians were persistent. All that research training."

"I obtained the information I required."

"Did you?" She set down the knife and picked up something longer. A short spear, the point already gleaming. "Or did you just confirm that we are preparing for war while you maintain comfortable neutrality?"

"I am investigating assault, not choosing sides in political conflict."

"Everything is political conflict. Medical triage is political. Resource distribution is political. Deciding whose petrification merits investigation versus whose suffering merits dismissal—extremely political." She resumed sharpening, the blade scraping against stone in steady rhythm. "You investigated Demos's assault immediately. How long did the Watch wait before investigating attacks on Gorgons last year? Three weeks? Four?"

Cornelius did not have response data. He had not tracked historical assault-investigation timelines across demographic categories.

Which was itself answer enough.

"The current investigation prioritizes—"

"Protecting institutional authority and maintaining civic order. I know." Xanthe's serpent hair moved in sharp, agitated patterns. "I read the Council minutes. They are public record, available in your excellent library. Very educational regarding whose safety merits emergency protocols versus whose oppression merits procedural acceptance."

"I did not author the roundup mandate."

"But you benefit from the systems that enable it. Your library receives Council funding. Your position carries civic authority. Your species grants you freedom of movement that my people are currently being denied." She set down the spear and stood, moving closer. "You investigate comfortably from inside the power structure and then wonder why we prepare weapons."

"Preparing for armed conflict will only justify Theo's worst enforcement instincts."

"Accepting disarmament will only guarantee our defenselessness when those instincts activate anyway." She gestured toward the deeper tunnels. "You saw the barricades. You saw the weapon preparation. You think we do this casually? You think we want to fight the Watch?"

"I think you are escalating toward violence that will harm everyone involved."

"We are preparing for violence that is already occurring. Roundups are violence. Registration protocols are violence. Forced supervision is violence." Her voice remained level, which somehow made it more intense. "The fact that your Council writes laws authorizing such violence does not make it less violent. It just makes it legal."

Cornelius's tail curled tight. "And if your preparation leads to actual combat? If Watch patrols enter the Enclave and your people resist with force?"

"Then the violence becomes visible enough that even comfortable librarians must acknowledge it." Xanthe picked up her spear again. "Maybe that visibility matters. Maybe forcing people to see what they would rather ignore serves collective good."

"Or maybe it results in casualties that could have been prevented through negotiation."

"We tried negotiation. We tried filing complaints through proper channels. We tried appealing to Temple leadership about biased triage." She tested the spear's balance. "Demos tried helping quietly through unauthorized charity. Look where that got him."

The connection was deliberately provocative. "You believe Demos was attacked because he treated Gorgon patients?"

"I believe people who threaten comfortable systems get eliminated. Whether through petrification, policy, or procedural dismissal." She moved back toward her ledge. "Go back to your library, Cornelius Drake. Catalogue your books. Maintain your neutrality. But when the Watch comes down here with detention orders, remember that you were warned. Remember that we asked for help before we picked up weapons."

"I am helping. I am investigating—"

"You are investigating one crime while ignoring systemic violence that enabled it. You are treating symptoms while preserving the disease." She sat down and resumed sharpening. "When the fighting starts, do not pretend you could not see it coming."

The scraping sound continued, steady and ominous, as Cornelius turned toward the exit.

He climbed back through the wine cellar and emerged into the civic quarter's familiar stone streets. The transition from cistern dampness to city air felt jarring. Above him, the library's dome rose against the sky, solid and permanent.

Safe.

While below ground, an entire community prepared for siege.

Cornelius spread his wings and launched himself toward the library, Xanthe's final words echoing in his mind.

*When the fighting starts, do not pretend you could not see it coming.*

He could see it. He could see the violence building like pressure behind a dam. The Watch organizing enforcement. The Enclave preparing resistance. The systematic failures that had created conditions where roundups seemed reasonable and armed defense seemed necessary.

He could see all of it with perfect clarity.

And he still had no functional idea how to prevent the inevitable explosion.

# Chapter 8

The ledger was a disaster.

Cornelius adjusted his spectacles for the fourth time in as many minutes and resisted the urge to set fire to the entire document. Brother Demos's handwriting had apparently been shaped by the belief that legibility was optional and organizational systems were suggestions rather than requirements.

The ledger sat open on the reading table in his private study—a small stone room adjacent to the main archive floor where Cornelius maintained his personal research materials and what Zeph persistently referred to as his "secondary hoard." The afternoon light from the high windows illuminated the pages without providing any additional clarity to Demos's chaotic record-keeping.

Numbers ran sideways up margins. Abbreviations appeared without legend or explanation. Entire sections were written in what might have been personal shorthand or possibly the linguistic equivalent of a fever dream.

Cornelius had successfully stolen the ledger from Temple storage along with sufficient medical supplies to treat Melaina for at least a week. The theft had been distressingly simple—the Temple's administrative offices remained focused on organizing the charity book sale while Photine managed the infirmary alone. He had entered through the western storage access, located the medical supply inventory, appropriated what he required, and departed without encountering anyone more authoritative than a distracted acolyte who had assumed Cornelius possessed official authorization based purely on his civic position and species-based intimidation factor.

Criminal enterprise, it appeared, rewarded confidence and the strategic deployment of institutional assumptions.

But the ledger itself was proving far more resistant to interpretation than locked doors had been to theft.

Cornelius turned another page and encountered a section that appeared to document patient visits through a system of symbols rather than names. A circle with three lines meant something. A triangle with a dot represented something else. Whether these corresponded to species, illness categories, or Demos's personal mood remained frustratingly unclear.

He was attempting to decode what might have been either "house call to G.Q." or "hostile crab to G.Q." when Imelda entered the study carrying two cups of tea and the particular expression that suggested she had been observing his frustration for several minutes before intervening.

"You have been staring at that ledger for three hours," she said. She set one cup beside his workspace and claimed the reading chair near the window. "Have you eaten?"

"Eating is not a forensic priority."

"Eating is a biological requirement. Even for dragons who believe they can subsist entirely on stubbornness and mint." She sipped her tea. "I have bread and cheese in my office if you require sustenance."

Cornelius did require sustenance. He had not eaten since early morning and his concentration was suffering accordingly. But admitting this would validate Imelda's maternal oversight tendencies.

He ignored the tea and returned his attention to the ledger. "Demos apparently believed that proper accounting procedures were negotiable. This section appears to track expenditures through a combination of abbreviated locations, partial names, and symbols that may represent either species categories or possibly weather conditions."

"He was a healer, not an accountant."

"He was a healer managing Temple finances. Basic organizational competence should have been mandatory." Cornelius traced one entry with his claw-tip. "Look at this. 'Three cases F.R. to G.Q. via D.M.' What does that mean? Cases of what? G.Q. could be Gorgon Quarter or possibly Guild Quarters. D.M. might be a person or an abbreviation for delivery method."

Imelda leaned forward to examine the entry. "F.R. is probably Fever Root. The Temple uses abbreviated names for common medicines to save space in inventory records."

Cornelius blinked. "How do you know that?"

"Because I served on the Temple donation committee for fifteen years before you hatched. I am familiar with their administrative systems." She pointed to another entry. "B.S. is likely Boneset. W.B. is Willow Bark. These are standard medical abbreviations."

The pattern suddenly resolved into clarity. Cornelius turned back several pages and reviewed earlier entries with this new interpretive framework. "So this entire section documents medicine distribution. Fever Root to Gorgon Quarter delivered via... D.M. Direct method? Door-to-door?"

"Demos himself." Imelda's voice had gone quiet. "D.M. probably stands for Demos. He was hand-delivering medicines."

Cornelius worked backward through the entries, applying the medical abbreviation structure and the delivery-method hypothesis. The pattern emerged with devastating precision.

Demos had been tracking unauthorized medical distributions. Not just occasional charity cases but systematic, sustained treatment of patients who could not afford standard Temple fees. The entries dated back at least eight months and showed consistent, escalating commitment.

Three cases of Fever Root to the Gorgon Quarter.

Five units of Boneset to the dock workers' tenements.

Two cases of bandage supplies to the leatherworkers' guild.

All delivered personally. All provided without charge. All drawn from Temple inventory without official authorization or cost recovery.

"He was treating everyone," Cornelius said. "Everyone the Temple's triage system excluded or deprioritized. He was running a complete parallel medical network."

"Yes." Imelda set down her tea. "Which explains why the Temple approached bankruptcy. They were purchasing supplies at full cost and distributing them freely through Demos's charity operation."

Cornelius turned to the financial summary pages near the ledger's end. The numbers were more comprehensible than the treatment logs—simple accounting rendered in neat columns. Income versus expenditure. Donations versus supply costs.

The gap between them widened with each passing month.

The Temple had been spending approximately forty percent more on medical supplies than their donation income supported. The deficit had been growing steadily for nearly a year.

"Photine said Demos was bankrupting the clinic," Cornelius murmured. "She was not exaggerating. He was spending resources faster than the Temple could acquire them."

"He was saving lives the Temple's official policies excluded." Imelda's tone carried no judgment. Simply statement of fact. "Someone always bears the cost of mercy. Usually the person providing it."

Cornelius thought of his own book donations. The rare volumes he had finally contributed after hearing about the Temple's resource crisis. How he had framed it as temporary necessity rather than acknowledging the permanent loss.

How he had resented being asked to help at all.

While Demos had been quietly destroying his professional standing and compromising his institution's financial stability to ensure that sick children received treatment regardless of their families' ability to pay.

The shame was a physical sensation, settling in his chest like ballast.

He turned another page and found himself looking at a section titled simply "Special Cases." The handwriting here was neater, more careful. These entries mattered differently.

Patient M: Progressive petrification. Symptoms consistent with degenerative Gorgon condition. Standard treatments ineffective. Consulted with Mother Ligeia. Attempting experimental protocols.

Patient M appeared repeatedly across subsequent pages. Treatment notes. Medication adjustments. Observations about symptom progression.

Melaina.

Demos had been treating her for at least two months. Trying everything available within Temple resources and several things that were probably not officially sanctioned. The entries showed increasing frustration mixed with determined experimentation.

The final entry regarding Patient M was dated two days before Demos's petrification:

Secured S.Q.S. from emergency reserves. If this does not stabilize the condition, we may need to consider Temple leadership involvement despite risks to patient safety and family reputation.

S.Q.S.

Cornelius scanned backward through the ledger looking for the abbreviation's prior use. He found it in the inventory section—a separate log tracking Temple supply reserves.

Sandalwood Quarantine Soap.

The notation appeared in multiple places, always marked as restricted inventory. Expensive. Regulated. Reserved for containment protocol during infectious outbreaks.

Ten cases logged into storage six months ago.

Ten cases signed out three weeks ago.

Signed out to P.K.

Cornelius went very still.

P.K.

Not Demos.

He checked the signature authentication marks beside the entry. The handwriting was different from Demos's chaotic scrawl. More controlled. Tighter loops on the letters.

Someone else had withdrawn the Sandalwood Quarantine Soap from emergency reserves.

Someone with authorization to access restricted inventory.

Someone whose initials were P.K.

Photine Kallistos.

Cornelius's mind raced through connections. Sandalwood at the crime scene. Sandalwood on Melaina when Niko brought her to the library. Photine's violent reaction when he had mentioned sandalwood preservation in the infirmary.

The contamination terror. The obsessive cleaning. The bleeding hands.

She had taken the quarantine supplies. Not for outbreak containment. For something else.

For someone.

Cornelius reviewed the timeline. The soap requisition dated to three weeks ago. Demos's notes about Patient M showed treatments continuing until two days before his petrification. The specialized soap appeared nowhere in his treatment protocols for Melaina.

Which meant Photine had withdrawn expensive, regulated supplies for purposes unrelated to Demos's documented patient care.

For purposes she was desperate to conceal.

The study door opened. Cornelius looked up and found Zeph standing in the entrance, slightly out of breath.

"Someone's here to see you," Zeph said. "One of the Gorgon Enclave kids. She says Mother Ligeia sent her with a message."

Cornelius closed the ledger carefully. "Bring her to the consultation room. I will meet her there."

Zeph disappeared. Cornelius heard his footsteps retreating down the corridor, accompanied by quieter steps that suggested their visitor moved with considerable caution.

Imelda stood and collected both tea cups. "You should eat something before conducting additional interrogations."

"I am not interrogating. I am receiving information."

"You are going to interrogate that information until it confesses something useful." She moved toward the door. "I will bring bread. Try not to terrify the messenger while I am gone."

She departed before Cornelius could formulate appropriate denial.

He gathered the ledger and his notes and made his way to the consultation room—a small chamber near the library's main entrance designed for patron research assistance and reference interviews. The space contained a reading table, several chairs, and excellent acoustics for private conversation.

The messenger was young. Perhaps thirteen or fourteen. Her serpent hair coiled nervously around her shoulders and she stood near the door rather than claiming one of the chairs. She carried a folded paper sealed with what appeared to be wax from a candle rather than formal sealing compound.

"Cornelius Drake?" Her voice was quiet but steady. "Mother Ligeia sent this. She said to deliver it directly to you and no one else."

Cornelius accepted the message. "Thank you. Does Mother Ligeia require a response?"

"She said you would understand what to do after reading it." The girl glanced toward the corridor. "I should go. The Watch is enforcing curfew for—for our people. I need to get back before they start asking questions."

"Be careful."

She nodded and fled with the particular contained panic of someone navigating hostile territory.

Cornelius waited until her footsteps faded before breaking the seal and unfolding the message.

The handwriting was precise despite being written without visual reference. Ligeia's serpent hair could apparently guide her hand with remarkable accuracy.

*The Flower is wilting. Tell the Healer. She knows what must be done but fears the cost. Remind her that some flowers require difficult transplanting to survive.*

Cornelius read the message three times.

The Flower.

Melaina.

Except Ligeia believed Melaina was safely hidden in Cornelius's archive. She had confirmed as much during their conversation in the cisterns. She knew Niko had brought the girl to the library.

So why would she send a message saying the Flower was wilting?

Unless there was another Flower.

Another patient. Another person requiring protection and specialized care.

*Tell the Healer.*

Not "tell the Temple." Not "tell Photine."

The Healer.

Someone Ligeia trusted. Someone she believed would understand what needed to be done.

Cornelius thought of Photine's terror in the infirmary. Her obsessive fear of contamination. Her frantic scrubbing of spilled medicine while her hands bled.

Her withdrawal of ten cases of Sandalwood Quarantine Soap for unauthorized purposes.

*She knows what must be done but fears the cost.*

What cost would terrify a competent healer badly enough to cause psychological breakdown?

What would require quarantine supplies and secret treatment?

What would connect to Demos's investigation of fever patterns and his final notes about "Temple leadership involvement despite risks to patient safety and family reputation"?

Cornelius returned to his study and retrieved the ledger. He opened it to the inventory section and examined the Sandalwood Quarantine Soap entry more carefully.

Ten cases signed out to P.K. three weeks ago.

Each case contained approximately twenty bars of specialized soap according to Temple standard packaging.

Two hundred bars of quarantine-grade sandalwood soap.

Enough to maintain isolation protocol for a single patient for approximately six months.

Or to preserve medicines for transport to multiple patients over shorter periods.

Cornelius thought of the sandalwood scent at the crime scene. On Melaina. In Photine's treatment supplies.

A preservative agent. Standard for transported medicines in Demos's charity network.

But also a quarantine requirement.

Required for containment of infectious illness.

The pattern assembled itself with terrible clarity.

Photine was treating someone in isolation. Someone whose condition required quarantine protocol and complete secrecy. Someone whose illness connected to the fever cases Demos had been investigating.

Someone whose exposure would create "risks to patient safety and family reputation."

Family reputation.

Photine Kallistos.

A healer from one of the Three Families. A professional whose standing depended on maintaining institutional authority and social position.

What would destroy that reputation?

What would require hiding rather than treating through official Temple channels?

*The Flower is wilting.*

Not Melaina.

Someone else.

Someone Photine was protecting at the cost of her professional integrity, Temple resources, and apparently her psychological stability.

Cornelius set down the ledger and stared at the message.

He needed to speak with Photine. Directly. Without Watch presence or Temple administration interference.

He needed to understand what she was hiding and whether it connected to Demos's petrification.

But first, he needed to address his own moral accounting.

Cornelius rose and crossed to the collection vault—the climate-controlled storage chamber where the library's most valuable and fragile materials resided. He had installed additional security measures here beyond the standard civic protections. Temperature regulation. Humidity control. Restricted access.

His actual hoard, in the truest draconic sense.

The *Chronicles of the Founding* occupied a dedicated shelf near the vault's center. Twelve volumes bound in treated leather, the pages hand-scribed by the city's original record-keepers. Maps. Treaties. Architectural plans. Genealogies.

The complete documented history of Solterra Bay's establishment and early governance.

Irreplaceable. Comprehensive. Permanent knowledge that could not be replicated or reconstructed if lost.

Worth approximately two hundred gold in private sale to the right collector.

Enough to fund Temple medical operations for three months if allocated efficiently.

Cornelius lifted the first volume and felt its familiar weight. The leather had developed a particular texture from decades of careful handling. The pages smelled of preservation oils and historical significance.

He had been hoarding this collection for forty years. Maintaining it. Protecting it from donation requests and civic redistribution mandates.

Preserving it.

While Demos had been spending himself into institutional collapse to ensure sick children received treatment.

Cornelius carried the volume to his preparation table and began wrapping it in protective cloth. His movements were methodical. Careful. Each fold precise and secure.

Imelda entered carrying a plate of bread and cheese. She stopped when she saw what he was doing.

"The *Chronicles*," she said quietly.

"I am preparing it for private sale. I have a contact among the Doukas family archivists who has expressed interest in acquiring historical materials for their personal collection." Cornelius continued wrapping. "The sale should yield sufficient funds to sustain Temple operations through winter if Photine manages resources with reasonable efficiency."

"That is your most valued possession."

"That is a book. Demos was a person." He secured the wrapping with careful knots. "Apparently I require repeated instruction regarding relative value assessment."

Imelda set down the plate and moved closer. She placed one ink-stained hand on the wrapped volume. "This is genuine sacrifice. Not obligation performed under pressure. You are choosing this."

"I am choosing to stop hoarding while people die of preventable illness. The moral complexity is minimal." He stepped back from the table. "I will arrange the sale tomorrow and transfer the funds directly to Temple accounts with specifications that they be allocated toward medical supplies rather than administrative costs."

"Cornelius." Imelda's voice carried the particular weight that indicated she was speaking as his mother rather than his supervisor. "You understand that this changes nothing regarding Demos's condition. The money will help future patients but it cannot reverse his petrification."

"I understand. I am not attempting to purchase redemption or retroactive moral standing." He adjusted his spectacles. "I am simply allocating resources toward the community need with greatest impact potential. Practical resource management rather than emotional gesture."

"You are lying to yourself about your own motivations."

"Probably. But the outcome remains beneficial regardless of my psychological self-deception." He moved toward the door. "I need to visit Photine. Tonight. After the Temple closes for evening services."

"That is a terrible idea."

"That is an investigative necessity. Ligeia's message implies Photine is concealing information critical to understanding Demos's assault." He paused in the doorway. "And possibly to identifying additional patients suffering from whatever condition is affecting Melaina."

Imelda's expression shifted toward concern. "You believe there is an outbreak."

"I believe Demos was investigating fever patterns. I believe Photine withdrew quarantine supplies for unauthorized purposes. I believe both of them recognized a threat they were attempting to manage without Temple leadership involvement." He looked back at the wrapped *Chronicles*. "And I believe whatever they were trying to prevent has already begun."

The silence stretched between them. Beyond the study walls, the library conducted its ordinary evening operations. Patrons browsing shelves. Zeph probably avoiding actual work while appearing productively busy.

Normal civic function maintained while crisis developed in shadows.

"Be careful," Imelda said finally. "Photine is not stable. And cornered people make dangerous choices."

"I am aware. I will exercise appropriate caution."

He left Imelda in the study and returned to his private archive. Melaina remained where he had left her—curled in the corner on a nest of spare cushions Zeph had assembled, sleeping while Niko maintained watch from a reading chair.

The shapeshifter looked up when Cornelius entered. "Any news?"

"Possibly. How is she?"

"Same. Fever has not gotten worse but it has not improved." Niko's expression showed worry that suggested genuine attachment rather than simple duty. "The medicines you brought are helping with pain management but not addressing the underlying condition."

Cornelius approached and examined Melaina without waking her. Her breathing remained steady but shallow. Her skin temperature was elevated. The faint scent of sandalwood clung to her clothes and hair.

Quarantine soap.

Someone had been washing her with quarantine protocol supplies.

Someone had been maintaining isolation procedures while attempting treatment.

Someone who feared contamination spreading beyond containment.

*The Flower is wilting. Tell the Healer.*

Two flowers. Two patients. One quarantine supply chain.

Whatever illness was affecting Melaina, Photine was treating someone else with the same condition.

Someone whose reputation required absolute secrecy.

Family reputation.

Cornelius turned to Niko. "When Mother Ligeia directed you to bring Melaina here, did she mention why? Specifically why the library rather than maintaining concealment in the Enclave?"

Niko hesitated. "She said the Enclave was not safe. That someone was looking for Melaina and they could not protect her properly while managing the roundup situation."

"Who was looking for her?"

"She did not say. Just that it was safer to move her before questions started being asked."

Before questions connected Melaina to Demos's treatment network.

Before investigation revealed the fever patterns and quarantine protocols.

Before someone discovered that Brother Demos had been managing two critically ill Gorgon patients through unauthorized charity care while Sister Photine provided quarantine supplies without Temple authorization.

The structure was there. The connections visible.

He simply needed confirmation.

And that required confronting Photine directly.

Cornelius left instructions with Niko regarding Melaina's care and returned to the main library floor. The evening shift had begun—Imelda managing the circulation desk while Zeph reshelved returns with his characteristic creative interpretation of proper sorting methodology.

Cornelius bypassed them both and climbed to his roost in the library's dome. The city spread below him, the civic quarter's organized stone giving way to the more chaotic residential neighborhoods and eventually the docks.

Somewhere in that layered architecture, people were sick with something the Temple's healers could not cure.

Somewhere, Photine was maintaining secret quarantine protocols while managing institutional collapse.

Somewhere, the truth waited to be excavated from fear and desperate concealment.

Cornelius adjusted his spectacles and watched the Temple's lights begin their evening dimming sequence.

Soon, he would have answers.

He was not certain he would appreciate what those answers revealed.

# Chapter 9

# Chapter 9

The fish market safehouse smelled of brine and old wood. Cornelius adjusted his spectacles and regretted every decision that had led him to this particular location.

The building occupied a narrow space between a gutted warehouse and what appeared to be either a very small residence or a very large storage shed. Access required navigating a maze of rotting crates and fishing equipment that someone had optimistically labeled as "temporary storage" approximately three years ago based on the deterioration patterns.

Cornelius had followed Xanthe here after watching her leave the Enclave through a secondary exit—a narrow drainage passage that emptied into the warehouse district. She had moved quickly, checking for Watch patrols with the practiced efficiency of someone who expected surveillance.

She had not expected aerial pursuit.

Cornelius landed on the warehouse roof and folded his wings. Below him, lamplight filtered through gaps in the safehouse walls. Voices carried through the inadequate insulation—multiple speakers, possibly four or five people conducting what sounded like strategic planning rather than casual conversation.

He descended to ground level and approached the door. It was locked, which was reasonable. It was also constructed from scavenged planks that varied in thickness and quality, which suggested the lock was more symbolic than functional.

Cornelius knocked.

The conversation inside stopped immediately. Footsteps approached. The door opened six inches, revealing Xanthe's face and a knife positioned at approximately throat height for human visitors.

She lowered the knife when she recognized him. "You followed me."

"Your exit route was insufficiently concealed for someone attempting covert movement."

"Or maybe I wanted you to follow me. Maybe I am tired of waiting for the Watch to drag me into interrogation again." She stepped back and opened the door wider. "Come in, Librarian. Let us have this conversation before Theo decides to skip formalities and move straight to detention."

Cornelius entered. The interior matched external impressions—minimal furniture, maximum strategic positioning. Three other Gorgons occupied the space, all younger than Xanthe, all armed with improvised weapons ranging from sharpened tools to what appeared to be actual military-grade short swords.

They watched Cornelius with the particular wariness of people prepared to defend themselves but hoping they would not need to.

"Out," Xanthe said to them. "Take watch positions. Whistle pattern if Watch approaches."

They departed silently. Xanthe closed the door and gestured toward a bench that looked structurally questionable. "Sit if you want. Or stand if you prefer maintaining dragon superiority."

Cornelius remained standing. "I require clarification regarding your movements on the night Brother Demos was petrified."

"I already told Theo. I was home. With my cousin. Who was dying of fever because your Temple decided her life was not worth the cost of medicine." Xanthe's serpent hair coiled tight. "You want more detail? I was changing fever-soaked sheets. I was forcing water down her throat because she was too weak to drink on her own. I was listening to her beg for help while knowing the Temple would not send anyone unless we could pay fees we did not have."

"Your alibi depends entirely on testimony from someone who was critically ill and possibly unconscious."

"My alibi depends on truth. Whether you believe it is your problem, not mine." She leaned against the wall, knife still visible in her hand. "Why are you really here, Cornelius Drake? You already decided I am guilty. Theo decided before he even asked questions. The Watch has decided collectively. What difference does my answer make?"

Cornelius opened the satchel he carried and withdrew Demos's ledger. He placed it on the table between them. "Because Brother Demos kept records. Incomplete records. Chaotic records. But records nonetheless."

Xanthe's expression did not change. She looked at the ledger without moving closer. "Where did you get that?"

"From Temple administrative storage. Without authorization. Which constitutes theft, making us both criminals now." He opened the ledger to the charity distribution section. "Demos documented his unauthorized medical network. Including treatments provided to Gorgon Quarter residents. Including, I believe, treatments provided to your cousin."

Xanthe moved forward despite herself. She looked at the pages, her serpent hair orienting toward the writing as though she could extract meaning through proximity. "What does it say?"

"That Brother Demos treated your cousin four times over the past two months. That he provided fever treatments, pain management, and experimental protocols when standard medicines failed." Cornelius traced one entry. "That he returned three days before his petrification and noted that her condition was deteriorating despite all interventions."

Xanthe's hand tightened on her knife. "He came back. After the argument in the square. After I accused him of murder through neglect. He came back."

"He came back because you were correct. Your cousin needed treatment. The fact that he could not provide it through official channels did not mean he would abandon her to suffer untreated."

"Then why refuse me in the square? Why make me beg in front of witnesses while pretending he could not help?" Her voice cracked. "Why humiliate me if he planned to help anyway?"

"Because the Temple was collapsing financially. Because Photine was monitoring his movements. Because admitting publicly that he was treating patients without documentation would have ended his ability to help anyone." Cornelius closed the ledger. "He performed cruelty publicly to maintain capacity for mercy privately. You hated him for theater while he was actively saving your cousin's life in secret."

Xanthe stared at the ledger. Her knife lowered slowly. "I called him a murderer."

"You called him what the situation appeared to warrant based on available information. Your anger was justified by systemic triage policies that prioritize wealth over need."

"But he was not enforcing those policies. He was undermining them." She set the knife on the table. Her hands were shaking. "I wanted him dead. I wanted whoever refused to treat her to suffer the way she was suffering. I wanted—"

She stopped. Her serpent hair coiled so tight it looked painful.

Cornelius watched her carefully. "You wanted revenge. That is understandable. The question is whether you acted on that desire."

"I wanted to act on it. I thought about it constantly. I imagined walking into the Temple and forcing them to watch her die since they would not help prevent it." Xanthe's voice had gone flat. "But I did not actually do anything. I went home. I took care of my cousin. I changed her sheets and forced medicine down her throat and pretended I had any control over whether she lived or died."

"Where did you obtain the medicine if the Temple would not provide it?"

"Mother Ligeia. She has supplies from—from sources. Enclave sources. Not Temple-sanctioned but effective enough to manage pain." Xanthe looked up. "You think I petrified Demos. You think I followed him to the Archives and turned him to stone as punishment for refusing public treatment."

"I think someone with motive, opportunity, and capability is generally the statistical favorite in assault investigations."

"Then arrest me. Bring Theo and his guards and drag me to detention. Add me to whatever list he is building for mass roundups." She spread her hands, displaying empty palms. "I hated Demos. I hate the Temple. I hate the Three Families and their donation politics and the entire system that treats my people as disposable. But I did not petrify anyone."

Cornelius studied her. The anger was real. Raw and immediate, like fresh wounds rather than calculated performance. It radiated from her in waves—the kind of fury that demanded immediate expression rather than patient planning.

Xanthe was a blade, not a poison.

She would confront directly, publicly, with witnesses. She would attack in the square during arguments, not in archives during quiet filing work.

She lacked the cold discipline required for the kind of controlled magic that had petrified Demos.

"I believe you," Cornelius said.

Xanthe blinked. "What?"

"I believe you did not petrify Brother Demos. Your anger is too visible. Too immediate. Too honest." He returned the ledger to his satchel. "The petrification required sustained focus and deliberate magical channeling. It required patience and planning. It required someone capable of appearing harmless while executing precise violence."

"So I am too angry to be a good criminal?"

"You are too angry to be a calculating one. Which eliminates you from primary suspect status despite Captain Theo's procedural preferences."

Xanthe laughed, but it sounded more like pain than humor. "That is the strangest vindication I have ever received."

"I am not vindicating you. I am eliminating you from the suspect pool through behavioral analysis." Cornelius moved toward the door. "But you should know that Demos's ledger shows he treated your cousin until his final conscious night. Whatever happens to her now, it will not be because he abandoned her."

"It will be because the system killed him before he could finish saving her."

"Possibly. I am still determining which system and who specifically operated its mechanisms."

He left before Xanthe could respond. Outside, the warehouse district stretched dark and quiet except for distant Watch patrol bells enforcing curfew protocols.

Cornelius launched himself skyward and oriented toward the library. Below him, the city organized itself into familiar patterns—civic quarter's ordered stone, residential neighborhoods' chaotic growth, the Enclave's hidden cistern entrances barely visible as darker shadows against dark streets.

If not Xanthe, then who?

Someone with capability and motive.

Someone calm enough to channel petrification magic with surgical precision.

Someone who benefited from Demos's silence.

Kyra Kallistos.

The profile assembled itself with uncomfortable clarity. Wealthy Gorgon from a reputation-conscious family. Visited Photine repeatedly at odd hours. Present at the Temple the night of Demos's petrification. Invested in maintaining social status through careful identity management.

Someone who would fear exposure more than direct confrontation.

Someone who would plan rather than react.

Someone who needed Demos silenced before he revealed something that threatened family reputation.

Cornelius adjusted his flight path and descended toward the library's dome. The building rose solid and permanent against the civic quarter's organized architecture, lamplight filtering through high windows where Zeph was probably avoiding closing procedures.

He landed on the entrance steps and entered through the main doors. The library smelled of paper and lamp oil and the particular mustiness that accumulated in old buildings despite regular cleaning.

Safe. Organized. Comprehensible.

Everything the investigation was not.

Zeph looked up from the circulation desk where he was ostensibly sorting returned materials but actually appeared to be constructing some kind of architectural sculpture from stacked books.

"You are back." Zeph abandoned his construction project. "Did you find Xanthe? Did she confess to petrifying Demos in dramatic fashion while cackling about revenge?"

"She confessed to wanting revenge but denying action. Her anger profile is inconsistent with premeditated assault." Cornelius moved past the desk toward his study. "I am refocusing investigation on Kyra Kallistos. She possesses stronger motive and demonstrates personality characteristics more consistent with calculated violence."

"Kyra?" Zeph followed. "The fancy Gorgon who keeps visiting Photine?"

"The same. She has means, motive, and access. She also benefits from maintaining secrecy regarding whatever medical situation required repeated private consultations with Temple healers."

"So you think she petrified Demos to prevent him from revealing she was sick? Or getting treatment? Or—" Zeph stopped walking. "Wait. That does not make sense. Why would being sick make her attack someone?"

"Because the nature of the illness matters more than the illness itself. If Kyra suffers from something that threatens family reputation, exposure would destroy her social standing." Cornelius entered his study and set down his satchel. "Particularly if that illness connected her to Gorgon community issues the Kallistos family prefers to distance themselves from publicly."

Zeph leaned against the doorframe. He had developed the particular expression that suggested he possessed information but was calculating whether sharing it would create additional problems.

Cornelius recognized that expression. "What have you discovered?"

"Maybe nothing. Probably nothing." Zeph picked at a loose thread on his sleeve. "But I was checking on Melaina earlier. Bringing her water and bread. Normal caretaking supervision."

"And?"

"And she smells like that soap. The sandalwood stuff. Really strongly, like someone just washed her with it." Zeph's voice had gone quiet. "Niko said Mother Ligeia had been using special soap to keep her clean. To prevent infection or contamination or something."

The connection formed immediately. Sandalwood Quarantine Soap. The same supplies Photine had withdrawn from Temple reserves. The same scent that had marked the crime scene.

"That is concerning but not surprising," Cornelius said. "Quarantine protocols would explain the soap usage if treating infectious illness."

"Yeah. About that." Zeph was not meeting his eyes now. "Her feet. They are turning to stone. Like, actually stone. Niko showed me. The transformation started at her toes and it is spreading slowly upward. She cannot walk anymore because her feet do not bend."

Cornelius went absolutely still.

"What?"

"She is petrifying. Like Demos. Except slower. Way slower." Zeph finally looked up. "Niko said it has been happening gradually over weeks. That Mother Ligeia tried everything to stop it but nothing worked. That Demos was the only healer who took her seriously instead of just assuming someone attacked her."

The study walls felt too close. Cornelius moved to his desk and gripped the edge, scales prickling with the particular sensation that accompanied fundamental paradigm shifts.

Petrification as symptom.

Not assault. Not intentional violence.

Disease.

"Demos's notes," Cornelius said. "Patient M. Progressive petrification. Degenerative Gorgon condition. Standard treatments ineffective."

"That was Melaina?"

"That was Melaina. He was documenting her condition as medical phenomenon rather than criminal assault." Cornelius opened the ledger with shaking claws. "He was investigating fever patterns. Persistent illness resistant to treatment. Progressive magical deterioration."

"You think it is contagious?"

"I think Photine withdrew quarantine supplies for a reason. I think Demos was tracking multiple patients with similar symptoms. I think—" He stopped. Read the final entry again. "I think there is another patient. Someone Photine is treating in isolation. Someone whose condition requires absolute secrecy."

*The Flower is wilting. Tell the Healer. She knows what must be done but fears the cost.*

Two flowers.

Two patients.

Both petrifying slowly from degenerative illness rather than deliberate attack.

Both requiring quarantine protocols and secret treatment.

Both threatening reputation and stability if exposed.

"Demos was not attacked," Cornelius said. The words felt strange forming. "He was infected."

Zeph made a small sound. "Infected with what?"

"With whatever is turning Melaina to stone. With whatever the Temple is concealing through medical triage and resource restriction. With whatever Photine fears badly enough to cause psychological breakdown." Cornelius closed the ledger. "We have been investigating murder. We should have been investigating plague."

The silence stretched between them. Beyond the study, the library conducted its peaceful evening closure—lamps dimming, doors locking, the building settling into comfortable night routine.

While in the hidden archive below, a child slowly transformed into permanent stone.

While in the Temple, Demos remained frozen mid-gesture.

While somewhere in the city, another patient suffered the same progressive petrification.

And they had approximately forty hours remaining before Demos's condition became irreversible.

"What do we do?" Zeph's voice had gone very small.

Cornelius looked at the ledger. At the quarantine soap inventory records. At Ligeia's message with its desperate encoded plea.

*She knows what must be done but fears the cost.*

"We find Photine," Cornelius said. "We make her explain what she is hiding. And we discover whether Demos can be saved or if we are simply documenting another casualty of whatever is killing Melaina."

He moved toward the door. Zeph followed.

"Should I come with you?"

"No. Stay with Melaina. Monitor her condition. If the petrification accelerates, send for me immediately." Cornelius paused. "And Zeph? Do not let anyone else near her. Not Watch. Not Temple officials. Not anyone who might interpret her condition as criminal rather than medical."

"You think they would arrest her for being sick?"

"I think they would arrest her for being Gorgon and stone-touched during a period when the Watch requires convenient suspects." Cornelius spread his wings. "Keep her safe. I will return with answers."

He launched himself into the night air, leaving Zeph standing in the study doorway looking smaller and younger than sixteen should look.

The flight to the Temple took minutes. Cornelius descended toward the healer's wing, oriented toward the private quarters where senior staff maintained residence during active duty rotations.

Photine's window showed lamplight.

She was still awake.

Still working.

Still maintaining whatever desperate isolation protocol was slowly destroying her competence and stability.

Cornelius landed on her window ledge and knocked with one claw against the glass.

The light inside flickered. Shadows moved. Then the window opened and Photine looked out at him with eyes that showed no surprise whatsoever.

"I have been expecting you," she said. "Come inside, Cornelius Drake. We should discuss what I have done."

# Chapter 10

# Chapter 10

Cornelius did not enter through Photine's window.

He should have. The investigation required direct confrontation with the Temple healer, and Photine had explicitly invited him inside to discuss "what she had done." Every investigative protocol indicated this was the critical moment for extracting confession and clarifying motive.

But something in her voice stopped him.

Not fear. Not defiance. Something closer to resignation laced with desperate hope, as though she believed Cornelius already understood and had come to provide absolution rather than accusation.

Which meant she expected him to know something he did not yet know.

Cornelius stepped back from the window ledge. "I need to verify one detail first. I will return shortly."

Photine's expression did not change. "She is beautiful, is she not? Even like this."

"I do not—"

"You will." Photine closed the window gently, as though sealing a tomb rather than dismissing a visitor. The lamplight behind her extinguished.

Cornelius launched himself from the Temple wall, wings catching the cool night air with the particular snap that indicated agitation rather than controlled flight. The city spread below him in layers of stone and shadow—civic quarter's organized architecture giving way to the residential chaos and eventually the warehouse districts where he had confronted Xanthe.

Somewhere in that layered complexity, the truth waited.

But first, he needed to check on Melaina.

The library rose solid against the civic quarter's eastern edge, lamplight filtering through high windows where Zeph was maintaining watch over the archive. Cornelius angled toward the dome and descended to his private entrance—a reinforced window designed to accommodate draconic dimensions without requiring main door protocols.

The building smelled of old paper and lamp oil and the particular mustiness that no amount of cleaning entirely eliminated from stone foundations. Safe. Familiar. Organized according to systems Cornelius himself had implemented over decades of fastidious curation.

He folded his wings and moved through the administrative corridor toward the archive access. His claws clicked against stone floors with the rhythmic precision that usually provided comfort through predictability.

Tonight, the sound felt too loud. Too isolated.

Zeph appeared at the corridor's junction, moving quickly enough to suggest urgency but not quite running. His face showed the particular combination of worry and confusion that typically preceded requests for Cornelius to fix problems beyond standard library operations.

"You are back." Zeph's voice carried relief. "I was about to send Niko to find you."

"Why? Has Melaina's condition changed?"

"I do not know. Maybe. Probably." Zeph gestured toward the archive stairs. "Niko came to get me about twenty minutes ago. Said Melaina was acting strange. Breathing differently or something. I went down to check but the archive door is locked and I cannot find the key anywhere."

Cornelius went very still. "The archive door does not lock. It has never required locking because it is already secured behind three levels of restricted access."

"Well, it is locked now. And Niko is still inside with Melaina and he is not answering when I knock." Zeph was fidgeting with his sleeve, pulling at threads. "I thought maybe you had installed new security protocols or something. But you were gone and Imelda does not know anything about archive modifications and I did not want to break down the door without checking first."

The prickling sensation across Cornelius's scales intensified. He moved past Zeph toward the archive stairs, descending quickly enough that his claws sparked against stone edges.

The archive occupied the library's oldest section—stone chambers built during the city's founding that predated current civic architecture by at least two centuries. Cornelius maintained climate control through a combination of magical regulation and carefully designed ventilation. The temperature remained constant. The humidity stayed within acceptable preservation parameters.

The door should not lock.

He reached the archive entrance and found exactly what Zeph had described. The heavy oak door sat firmly closed, the latch engaged from the inside. Cornelius tested it. Solid. Immovable without applying force that would damage historical wood.

"Niko?" He pitched his voice to carry through the door. "This is Cornelius. I need you to open the door."

Silence.

"Niko, if Melaina's condition has deteriorated, I require immediate access to assess treatment options."

No response. No footsteps. No indication anyone inside heard or intended to respond.

Zeph pressed closer. "See? He has been ignoring me for fifteen minutes. I tried everything short of breaking the door."

Cornelius examined the latch mechanism. Standard sliding bolt, operated from either side. Currently engaged from within. Not locked in the traditional sense but effectively securing the space against external entry.

Which meant either Niko had deliberately barricaded them inside, or someone else had locked them in.

Or something had prevented both of them from responding.

The knowledge settled in Cornelius's chest like ice.

"Stand back," he said.

Zeph retreated three steps. Cornelius braced his shoulder against the door and pushed. The wood groaned. The hinges protested. The bolt held for approximately four seconds before the internal mechanism fractured and the door swung inward with a crack that echoed through the archive chambers.

The space beyond was dark except for a single lamp that Niko must have left burning on the reading table. Its light caught the edges of shelves and cast long shadows across floor tiles that Cornelius himself had cleaned just two days prior.

Everything appeared normal.

Except for the complete absence of movement or sound from living occupants.

Cornelius entered slowly, wings half-spread for balance. His vision adjusted to the lamplight, cataloging details. Books remained properly shelved. No signs of struggle or disturbance. The climate control hummed quietly, maintaining optimal preservation conditions.

Niko sat in the reading chair near the lamp.

Not sat.

Occupied the chair in the position sitting required. But without the subtle movements that distinguished living stillness from complete immobility.

His skin had the particular smooth uniformity that suggested stone rather than flesh. His eyes remained open, focused on something across the room. His hands rested on the chair arms with fingers slightly curled as though he had been mid-gesture when the transformation occurred.

Petrified.

Cornelius approached carefully and examined the statue without touching it. The details were extraordinary—individual hairs rendered in stone, fabric textures preserved perfectly, even the faint lines around Niko's eyes captured with sculptural precision.

This was not the rough, uneven petrification of an interrupted transformation or failed reversal.

This was complete. Deliberate. Executed with enough skill and control to preserve every detail.

"Is he—" Zeph's voice came from the doorway. Small. Uncertain.

"Petrified. Completely." Cornelius moved around the statue, analyzing the magical residue. It clung to the stone like morning dew, faint but present. The same signature he had detected on Demos.

But stronger. More stable. Less like an interrupted process and more like a finished work.

"Can you reverse it?"

"That depends on whether the original caster is available and willing to cooperate." Cornelius straightened and looked in the direction Niko's stone eyes focused.

Toward the corner where Melaina had been resting on her cushion nest.

Where a second statue now occupied the space.

Cornelius's breath stopped.

He crossed the archive floor in four strides, lamp-light catching the edges of his scales as he moved. The statue sat exactly where Melaina had been when Cornelius left to confront Xanthe. Same position. Same basic posture.

But transformed completely to grey stone.

She looked smaller somehow. Fragile. Her hands rested in her lap, fingers loosely intertwined. Her serpent hair coiled around her shoulders in patterns that suggested recent movement frozen mid-flow. Her eyes were closed, giving the impression of peaceful sleep rather than violent assault.

Her feet were completely stone. Solid grey from toes to ankles, the transformation that Zeph had described as gradual progression now fully manifested and extending upward into her legs.

Cornelius reached out and touched her shoulder.

Stone. Cold. Solid.

The temperature was wrong. Not the chill of death but the absolute neutrality of mineral composition. His claw-tips registered texture—smooth where her skin had been, slightly rougher where fabric creased.

He moved his hand to her throat and felt for the faint vibration that had indicated Demos's continued biological function beneath the petrification.

Nothing.

No pulse. No breath. No subtle indication that living processes continued beneath the surface.

Just stone.

Zeph made a small, broken sound behind him. "She is dead."

"Petrified." Cornelius withdrew his hand. "The distinction is important."

"How? You just said there is no—" Zeph stopped. Swallowed. Tried again with a voice that shook slightly. "There is no pulse. No breathing. That means dead."

"That means transformed. Whether the transformation is reversible depends on understanding its purpose and mechanics." Cornelius moved to examine Melaina's statue from different angles. The lamplight caught subtle variations in the stone's surface—smoother at her extremities, slightly more textured at her torso.

Old versus new petrification.

The disease's gradual progression layered beneath complete magical transformation.

Like preserving a partially-damaged manuscript by encasing it in protective crystal.

Cornelius went very still.

Preservation.

He straightened and inhaled deeply through his nose, activating the scent-analysis capability that most dragons possessed but he rarely deployed outside of identifying deteriorating paper or pest infestations.

The archive smelled of stone and old books and lamp oil.

And sandalwood.

Strong. Fresh. Pervasive.

Not the faint trace he had detected at Demos's crime scene or the subtle undertone that clung to Melaina's clothing from the quarantine soap.

This was recent application. Concentrated. Deliberate.

Someone had been here within the last hour and had brought sandalwood-preserved supplies or tools.

Someone who had petrified both Melaina and Niko with enough skill to create complete, stable transformations rather than the interrupted partial petrification that suggested assault or accident.

Cornelius returned to Niko's statue and examined it more carefully. The shapeshifter's expression showed surprise but not terror. His body language suggested he had stood from the chair and turned to face someone, mid-sentence, when the transformation occurred.

Fast enough that he could not defend himself.

Controlled enough that the petrification took him completely rather than leaving him partially transformed.

Which meant either:

Someone had attacked them both with extraordinary magical capability.

Or someone they trusted had transformed them deliberately while they were unaware of the threat.

The sandalwood scent was strongest near Melaina's statue.

Cornelius lowered his head and inhaled again, isolating components. Sandalwood base. Herbal undertones that suggested the quarantine soap composition. And beneath that, something else.

The faint chemical residue of preservation magic actively maintaining stasis.

Not death magic. Not assault magic.

Medical intervention.

The realization assembled itself with terrible clarity.

"This was not an attack," Cornelius said quietly.

Zeph moved closer, still maintaining careful distance from both statues. "What do you mean, not an attack? Someone turned them both to stone."

"Someone transformed them using the same controlled petrification magic that transformed Brother Demos. With the same signature. The same precise technique." Cornelius traced the air near Melaina's statue without touching it, mapping the magical residue. "And someone brought sandalwood quarantine supplies here recently, which suggests medical purpose rather than criminal intent."

"You think a healer did this?"

"I think Sister Photine did this." The words felt strange forming. Wrong. But simultaneously correct in the way that solving particularly difficult archival puzzles felt correct. "She withdrew ten cases of Sandalwood Quarantine Soap three weeks ago. She has been treating someone in isolation. She knew about Demos's charity network and his investigation of fever patterns."

"Okay, so Photine is the one who petrified Demos. We suspected that already." Zeph's voice had taken on the particular tone that suggested he was following the logic but disliking where it led. "But why would she petrify Melaina? And Niko?"

Cornelius looked at Melaina's statue. At her stone hands folded peacefully in her lap. At her closed eyes and slightly parted lips that suggested exhalation frozen mid-breath.

At her feet that had been slowly transforming to stone for weeks as the degenerative illness progressed.

"Because Melaina was dying," he said. The realization felt like watching puzzle pieces click into place with such perfect alignment that previous configurations became impossible to imagine. "Demos's notes documented progressive petrification. Treatments failing. Experimental protocols proving ineffective. The disease was advancing."

"So Photine petrified her to—what? Put her out of her misery?"

"To preserve her. To halt biological processes before the disease killed her completely." Cornelius moved back to examine the statue's base where it met the stone floor. "Petrification suspends all bodily functions. No breathing. No heartbeat. No cellular activity. Which means no disease progression."

The silence stretched between them. Beyond the archive walls, the library settled into its night-time patterns. Distant sounds of the city conducting evening routines filtered through stone foundations—Watch bells marking patrol shifts, late carriages rattling over cobblestones, the particular quiet that descended when most citizens retired to private spaces.

Normal civic function while they stood in a hidden chamber examining two people transformed to stone through what might have been desperate medical intervention rather than criminal assault.

"You are saying this is treatment," Zeph said finally. His voice had gone very small. "You are saying Photine turned Melaina to stone to save her life."

"I am saying Photine transformed Melaina to prevent her death. Whether that constitutes salvation or simply prolonged suspension remains to be determined based on whether reversal is possible." Cornelius examined his own claws, scales prickling with the discomfort of paradigm shifts. "We have been investigating murder. We should have been investigating triage."

"That does not make sense. You cannot triage someone by petrifying them."

"You can if petrification is the only method available to halt disease progression while seeking treatment." Cornelius turned to examine Niko's statue again. "Demos's final ledger entry mentioned Temple leadership involvement despite risks to patient safety and family reputation. Photine is Temple leadership. Photine is also Kallistos family."

"So?"

"So Mother Ligeia's message said 'the Flower is wilting. Tell the Healer. She knows what must be done but fears the cost.'" Cornelius moved back toward Melaina's statue. "This is what Ligeia meant. Photine knew how to halt Melaina's deterioration. But the cost was transforming her to stone without certainty that reversal would be possible."

Zeph made a sound like something breaking. "Melaina is the Flower."

"Melaina is one flower. I suspect there is another patient. Someone Photine has been treating in isolation. Someone whose illness threatened family reputation badly enough to require absolute secrecy despite medical ethics and institutional protocols."

"Who?"

"I do not know. But whoever they are, their connection to Photine is close enough that she risked professional destruction to keep them alive." Cornelius adjusted his spectacles. "And when Demos discovered the pattern and attempted to document it properly through Temple channels, she petrified him to prevent exposure."

The archive felt too small. Too quiet. The lamplight threw shadows that made the statues look almost alive—the illusion of movement created by flickering flame against carved stone.

Except these were not carvings.

They were people.

People who might still be saved if the spell could be reversed.

People who had been deliberately transformed by someone who believed this was the only option available.

Cornelius thought of Photine's bleeding hands. Her obsessive cleaning protocols. Her terror when he mentioned sandalwood preservation.

Her exhausted eyes and mechanical competence barely concealing psychological collapse.

She was not a killer.

She was a desperate healer managing impossible triage with inadequate resources and no institutional support.

She was doing exactly what Demos had done—providing care the Temple's official policies prohibited, sacrificing professional standing and personal stability to keep patients alive through whatever means available.

She was trying to save lives using the only tool that could halt the disease's progression while she searched for actual treatment.

And Cornelius had been investigating her as a murderer.

"We need to find Photine," Cornelius said. His voice sounded strange even to himself. "Immediately. Before the Watch locates her first."

"Why would the Watch—" Zeph stopped. Understanding spread across his face like shadow. "They will think she murdered Demos. And if they find Melaina and Niko like this, they will think she murdered them too."

"They will arrest her. They will demand reversal under interrogation. And if she refuses or cannot reverse the transformations fast enough, they will charge her with multiple murders and criminal negligence." Cornelius turned toward the door. "Captain Theo will execute whatever legal protocols allow the fastest resolution to protect Watch authority and civic order."

Which meant Photine would be detained. Possibly executed if the Council determined her actions constituted criminal assault rather than medical intervention.

Which meant Melaina and potentially Demos would remain stone permanently.

Which meant everyone involved would die or remain petrified because the investigation had categorized desperate mercy as deliberate violence.

Cornelius reached the archive door and stopped.

Photine had said she expected him.

She had said they needed to discuss what she had done.

She had closed her window and extinguished her lamp.

As though preparing to disappear rather than wait for his return.

"She knew I would discover this," Cornelius said. "She understood I would examine Melaina and recognize the medical signature. She anticipated that I would reach the correct conclusion."

"So where is she now?"

Cornelius looked back at Melaina's statue. At the peaceful expression and carefully folded hands. At the precise, controlled transformation that preserved every detail with sculptural care.

Treatment, not assault.

Desperate intervention, not calculated violence.

A healer doing what healers do when all authorized options fail and patients continue dying.

"She is hiding," Cornelius said quietly. "Or running. Or possibly preparing to reverse the transformations if she believes I have deduced her motives accurately enough to help rather than condemn."

"How do we find her?"

"We do not. We go to the one person who might know where Photine would seek sanctuary when facing institutional collapse and criminal prosecution."

Zeph's eyes widened. "Mother Ligeia."

"Mother Ligeia. Who sent the original message about the wilting Flower. Who knew Photine was treating Melaina. Who directed Melaina to my archive for protection." Cornelius spread his wings. "Who may have been coordinating with Photine to manage this outbreak without Temple leadership or Watch interference."

He moved toward the stairs, claws clicking against stone with renewed purpose. Behind him, the archive remained quiet except for the lamp's steady flame and the absolute stillness of two people preserved in stone.

Preserved.

Not killed.

The distinction mattered.

Cornelius just needed to make certain Captain Theo and the Watch understood that distinction before they arrested the only person capable of reversing the transformations.

# Chapter 11

Cornelius returned to Melaina's statue and knelt beside it, his claws clicking against the stone floor with the particular rhythm that indicated methodical analysis rather than agitated pacing.

The lamplight flickered across grey stone that had been living flesh approximately one hour prior. Cornelius adjusted his spectacles and began a proper forensic examination of the transformation, comparing what he observed against his mental catalog of Demos's condition in the Temple Archives.

Details mattered. Differences indicated intent.

He started with the extremities. Melaina's hands rested in her lap with fingers loosely intertwined—natural positioning that suggested conscious arrangement rather than mid-gesture freezing. The stone texture was uniform across all surfaces, showing no variation between areas that had petrified from disease progression and areas transformed through deliberate magic.

Complete integration. Seamless transition. Professional execution.

Cornelius moved to examine her face. The features showed peaceful repose. Eyes closed. Lips slightly parted as though she had exhaled gently before the transformation completed. No tension in the jaw. No fear-widened eyes or defensive positioning.

She had not been surprised.

She had possibly been prepared.

He extended one claw and tapped gently against her shoulder, listening to the resonance. Solid. Dense. The particular acoustic quality of well-executed petrification without internal fractures or incomplete transformation.

Then he placed his palm flat against her chest and felt for the faint vibrations he had detected in Demos's statue—the subtle indication that biological processes continued beneath the stone.

Nothing.

Complete absence of internal activity. No heartbeat. No breath. No cellular function.

Absolute stasis.

Cornelius sat back on his haunches and reassessed. When he had examined Demos three days ago, the petrification had been incomplete. Biological function persisted beneath the surface—faint but present, like distant drumbeats through thick walls.

Demos had been caught mid-process. Interrupted. Partially transformed.

Melaina showed no such incompleteness.

This was finished work.

"Is she going to be okay?" Zeph's voice came from near Niko's statue, where he had been maintaining careful distance while Cornelius conducted his examination.

"That depends on multiple variables including reversal feasibility, biological integrity preservation during stasis, and whether the original caster survives long enough to attempt restoration." Cornelius stood and moved to examine Niko's petrified form. "But the transformation itself appears stable. No structural degradation. No indication of magical decay."

"That is not actually answering my question."

"Because I do not yet possess sufficient data to provide definitive answers." Cornelius circled Niko's statue, analyzing the same details he had cataloged for Melaina. Position. Expression. Surface uniformity. Acoustic resonance.

All identical. Same technique. Same signature. Same complete stasis without biological activity.

Professional medical intervention executed with surgical precision.

He inhaled deeply, activating scent analysis again. The sandalwood fragrance remained strong—concentrated around both statues but particularly intense near Melaina's position.

Fresh application within the last two hours. Possibly within the last hour based on dispersal patterns in the archive's controlled climate.

Photine had been here.

Had brought quarantine supplies.

Had transformed both patients using the same controlled petrification magic.

But why?

Cornelius returned to Melaina and examined her feet—the area where Zeph had reported progressive disease-based petrification advancing from toes upward.

The stone was seamless. No visible distinction between flesh-turned-stone and disease-progressed stone. The magical transformation had incorporated the existing petrification so completely that identifying the boundary required magical analysis rather than visual inspection.

Preservation through integration.

Like repairing damaged manuscript pages by encasing them in protective crystal that became part of the material itself rather than external containment.

The comparison assembled itself with uncomfortable clarity.

Cornelius had spent decades preserving fragile texts. He understood the principle of stabilizing deteriorating materials before they degraded beyond recovery. Sometimes preservation required dramatic intervention—removing pages from damaged bindings, treating them individually, reconstructing the whole from carefully maintained parts.

Photine had applied the same principle to living patients.

Melaina's disease was destroying her slowly, progressing from extremities inward. Standard treatments had failed. Experimental protocols proved ineffective. The deterioration continued despite all medical intervention.

So Photine had stabilized her.

Halted all biological processes before the disease could advance further.

Preserved her in perfect stasis while searching for actual treatment.

The logic was sound. Medically defensible. Possibly the only option available when facing progressive magical illness with no known cure.

Except it required transforming living people into stone with uncertain reversibility and no guarantee that biological function could be restored after extended stasis.

Cornelius's scales prickled with the particular discomfort that accompanied recognizing his own behavioral patterns in others.

He hoarded books to preserve knowledge.

Photine petrified patients to preserve lives.

Both represented desperate attempts to prevent permanent loss through whatever means available, regardless of social acceptability or institutional approval.

The parallel was deeply uncomfortable.

"You are thinking very loudly," Zeph said. He had moved closer, though still maintaining distance from the statues. "What did you figure out?"

"That Sister Photine is significantly more competent than I initially assessed. And significantly more desperate." Cornelius returned his attention to Melaina's peaceful stone face. "She executed this transformation with enough precision to preserve every detail. Complete biological suspension without internal damage or structural instability."

"So that is good, right? That means Melaina can be reversed safely?"

"It means the petrification itself was performed correctly. Whether safe reversal is possible depends on factors I cannot assess without understanding the underlying magical mechanics and Photine's specific technique." Cornelius adjusted his spectacles. "But the stability suggests deliberate medical procedure rather than panicked assault."

Zeph made a sound that suggested he was processing this information without enjoying the implications. "You keep saying 'medical procedure' like that makes turning people to stone okay."

"I am saying it was intentional preservation rather than criminal violence. The distinction matters when determining whether Photine should be arrested or consulted." Cornelius moved toward the archive stairs, his mind already calculating next steps. "We need to locate her immediately. She is the only person capable of reversing these transformations."

"Wait." Zeph's voice sharpened. "You said Melaina's petrification was stable. What about Demos? His transformation was stable too, right? You said we had about forty hours left before his condition became permanent."

Cornelius stopped walking.

The calculation assembled itself with terrible speed.

Demos's petrification had been different.

Partial rather than complete.

Biological vibrations still present beneath the stone.

Mid-gesture positioning suggesting interrupted transformation rather than prepared stasis.

And—most critically—Demos had not been a prepared patient.

He had not been positioned carefully.

Had not been treated with quarantine supplies first.

Had not been given whatever preparation Photine used before executing controlled petrification.

He had been an accident.

Or an emergency intervention.

Executed quickly rather than carefully.

Cornelius turned and moved back to Melaina's statue with renewed urgency. He placed his palm against her chest again, feeling for vibrations, then moved to Niko and repeated the process.

Both completely still. Absolute stasis. Perfect suspension.

No biological activity because the spell had been executed correctly—designed to halt all function rather than merely interrupt it.

But Demos—

Demos still had faint heartbeat. Faint breath. Biological processes continuing beneath incomplete petrification.

Which meant his transformation was unstable.

Which meant the magical stasis was imperfect.

Which meant biological degradation could continue despite the stone exterior.

Cornelius's claws clicked rapid patterns against the floor as the implications cascaded through his analysis.

Forty hours had been an estimate based on standard petrification reversal windows. The documented timeframe during which Gorgon-induced petrification remained reversible before becoming permanent.

But that estimate assumed stable transformation.

Complete magical suspension.

Proper execution of the spell.

Demos's petrification was none of those things.

His biological processes continued—which meant cellular activity continued, which meant metabolic function continued at whatever reduced rate the imperfect stasis allowed.

Which meant he was not preserved.

He was dying slowly.

Suffocating inside stone that prevented breathing but did not halt the body's need for oxygen.

Starving inside a shell that stopped eating but did not suspend metabolic requirements.

"Cornelius?" Zeph had moved closer. "You have that expression you get when you discover someone mis-shelved an entire section. Except worse."

"We have less time than I calculated." Cornelius moved toward the stairs with increased speed. "Significantly less time. Demos's transformation is degrading."

"What does that mean?"

"It means he is dying inside the petrification rather than being preserved by it." Cornelius took the stairs three at a time, wings half-spread for balance. "His biological processes continue at reduced capacity. Without oxygen. Without nutrients. Without any mechanism to remove metabolic waste."

Zeph's footsteps followed quickly. "How long does he have?"

"I do not know. Hours. Possibly less." Cornelius emerged into the library's main floor and oriented toward his study. "The forty-hour estimate assumed proper stasis. Demos's condition is systematically failing. We need Photine immediately."

"Where would she go? You said she was hiding."

"I said she was likely hiding or preparing for next steps." Cornelius entered his study and grabbed the satchel containing Demos's ledger. "But Mother Ligeia sent a message saying 'Tell the Healer. She knows what must be done but fears the cost.' Which suggests Ligeia knew about the planned petrifications and possibly coordinated timing with Photine."

"So Photine might be at the Enclave?"

"Or Ligeia knows where she went after transforming Melaina and Niko." Cornelius paused at his desk, looking at the scattered notes and inventory records documenting his investigation. Three days of careful analysis. Methodical elimination of suspects. Professional forensic examination.

All rendered irrelevant by the simple fact that they were no longer investigating assault.

They were attempting rescue.

"I need you to remain here," Cornelius said. "Monitor the archive. If Watch arrives with inspection orders, deny them entry and send for Imelda immediately. She has sufficient institutional authority to delay Captain Theo if he attempts forced access."

"You are going to the Enclave alone?"

"I am going wherever Mother Ligeia directs me to find Photine. The Enclave is merely the starting location." Cornelius moved toward the window he used for aerial departures. "Ligeia trusted me with Melaina's protection. She will trust me with information about Photine's location if I explain the urgency."

"What if she does not know where Photine is?"

"Then I will expand search parameters based on available data regarding Photine's known locations, professional obligations, and likely hiding places." Cornelius opened the window. Cool night air carried the distant sounds of the city conducting pre-dawn routines—Watch shift changes, early market preparations, the particular quiet that preceded sunrise activity.

Somewhere in that layered urban complexity, Sister Photine was hiding or planning or possibly attempting to reverse transformations on her own without support or resources.

And Brother Demos was dying inside imperfect stone.

"Cornelius." Zeph's voice was smaller than usual. "What if you cannot find her in time?"

The question hung between them like physical weight.

Cornelius looked back at his assistant. Sixteen years old. Tired. Frightened. Trying to maintain composure while their investigation shifted from intellectual puzzle to desperate race against biological decay.

"Then I will have failed both Demos and Melaina," Cornelius said quietly. "And Captain Theo will arrest Photine for multiple murders instead of consulting her for advanced magical medicine. And three people will remain stone permanently because we categorized treatment as assault."

"That is not comforting."

"I am not attempting comfort. I am stating probable outcomes to clarify stakes." Cornelius positioned himself at the window. "Which is why I must locate Photine before dawn, convince her to return despite certain criminal prosecution, and persuade her to reverse Demos's unstable petrification before his biological integrity collapses completely."

"While also somehow preventing the Watch from arresting her the moment she appears."

"Correct."

"That seems impossible."

"It seems improbable. Impossible would require circumstances that preclude any potential solution regardless of resource application." Cornelius spread his wings. "We have resources. We have limited time. We have motivation. Therefore the problem remains solvable even if probability calculations suggest unfavorable outcomes."

Zeph made a sound that might have been a laugh or might have been exhaustion expressing itself through inappropriate humor. "You are saying we might fail but we should try anyway."

"I am saying failure is unacceptable despite being statistically likely. Therefore we will attempt success through whatever means prove necessary." Cornelius paused at the window opening. "Including theft, obstruction of legal investigations, and harboring fugitives from Watch detention."

"So basically we are already criminals and might as well commit additional crimes if they help save people."

"That is an oversimplification. But functionally accurate."

The library stretched quiet behind them. Stone walls and careful shelving and the accumulated knowledge of centuries organized according to systems Cornelius himself had implemented. Safe. Ordered. Predictable.

Everything the current situation was not.

Cornelius thought of his hidden hoard. The rare volumes he had concealed from Imelda's donation requirements. The precious texts he had protected from the charity sale despite knowing the Temple needed funding for medical supplies.

Books he had valued more than human lives.

Until confronting the reality of those lives—Demos bankrupting himself to provide charity care, Photine destroying her career to preserve dying patients, Melaina slowly transforming to stone while healers refused treatment she could not afford.

His hoard seemed increasingly indefensible.

Not because books lacked value.

But because he had treated their preservation as more important than people's survival.

"When I return," Cornelius said, "remind me to compile a complete catalog of my private collection for immediate sale. All proceeds to Temple medical funding."

Zeph blinked. "All of it? Even the books you hid from Imelda?"

"Especially those books. They represent the highest value and therefore generate the most funding for supplies." Cornelius adjusted his spectacles. "Demos spent everything to save people. I can at least spend my hoard to honor that sacrifice."

"That is—" Zeph stopped. Started again. "That is probably the least dragon-like thing I have ever heard you say."

"Demos was not a dragon. He had no instinct for hoarding or territorial preservation. Yet he managed superior resource allocation through systematic sacrifice of personal stability." Cornelius looked out at the pre-dawn city. "I am merely applying his methodology to my own excessive accumulation."

"You know he would probably tell you the books matter too. That knowledge preservation serves people even if the help is not immediate."

"Perhaps. But he is currently unavailable for consultation due to being petrified inside unstable stone while I waste time justifying past hoarding behavior." Cornelius launched himself from the window. "Secure the archive. Deny all entry. I will return with Photine or information about her location."

He did not wait for Zeph's response. The night air caught his wings and lifted him above the library's dome, above the civic quarter's organized stone architecture, toward the residential districts and eventually the old cistern system where the Gorgon Enclave maintained its hidden community.

Below him, the city continued its pre-dawn routines. Watch patrols marking territory. Early merchants preparing market stalls. The mechanical function of urban life proceeding according to established patterns.

While three people remained frozen in stone.

While one of them slowly died from the inside.

While the healer capable of reversing their conditions hid from the same authorities who should have been protecting her expertise.

Cornelius angled toward the cistern district and increased his speed.

Forty hours had been the estimate.

But Demos likely had significantly less.

And every minute Cornelius spent searching was one minute closer to permanent biological failure.

Human bodies were terribly fragile when subjected to magical stasis designed for different purposes. Imperfect preservation created imperfect outcomes. The longer Demos remained partly-petrified, the more damage accumulated from interrupted biological processes trying to function without proper resources.

Like trying to preserve a manuscript by coating it with wax while the pages continued absorbing moisture and breeding mold beneath the protective layer.

Eventually the preservation itself became destruction.

Cornelius descended toward the Enclave's primary entrance—a concealed passage behind a collapsed warehouse that led into the deeper cistern network. Guards would be posted. Security would be heightened during Watch enforcement of the registration protocols.

But Mother Ligeia had trusted him with Melaina.

She would trust him with this.

She had to.

Because the alternative was watching three people die while their would-be savior hid from authorities too rigid to distinguish medicine from murder.

Human inefficiency was going to kill them all.

Unless Cornelius located Photine first.

He landed at the warehouse entry and folded his wings.

Time to see if Mother Ligeia's trust extended to resurrection as well as preservation.

# Chapter 12

# Chapter 12

The Temple dormitories smelled of lavender soap and antiseptic solution—familiar scents from Cornelius's previous visits to question Photine, but somehow sharper in the pre-dawn quiet. The halls stretched narrow and utilitarian, doors evenly spaced along whitewashed stone walls designed for function rather than comfort.

Cornelius moved quickly despite his size, claws muffled against worn floor tiles. Behind him, Zeph matched his pace with the particular care of someone attempting stealth while uncertain of the proper technique.

"Are we sure this counts as investigation rather than breaking and entering?" Zeph's whisper carried more volume than actual whispers required.

"We are not breaking anything. We are entering a space temporarily abandoned by its primary occupant for purposes of locating time-sensitive medical information." Cornelius paused at a junction, orienting himself. "Photine's quarters are in the senior healers' wing. Third door past the supply closet."

"That is definitely breaking and entering."

"The door will not be locked. Temple policy requires healers to remain accessible during emergencies. Therefore we are simply accessing a publicly available space during an emergency." Cornelius turned down the correct corridor. "The distinction is legally significant even if ethically questionable."

"You are using a lot of words to say we are committing crimes."

"I am using precise language to clarify that our actions fall into a gray area of civic regulation rather than explicit criminality." Cornelius stopped at the appropriate door—plain wood, unmarked except for a small brass nameplate reading **P. Kallistos, Senior Healer**. "Which becomes relevant if Captain Theo discovers our presence and demands legal justification."

Zeph made a sound suggesting he found this logic unconvincing but lacked energy to argue further. "Just open the door before I lose my nerve."

Cornelius tested the latch. Unlocked, as expected. The mechanism clicked softly and the door swung inward on hinges that had been recently oiled—no squeak, no resistance.

The room beyond was stripped nearly bare.

Cornelius entered slowly, his analytical oversight cataloging details with the same methodical precision he applied to damaged manuscripts. The space measured approximately twelve feet by fifteen. A narrow bed occupied the far wall, its mattress still present but linens removed. A writing desk sat beneath the room's single window, surface empty except for a thin layer of dust. A wardrobe stood open, interior shelves visible and vacant.

No personal items. No clothing. No papers or books or the accumulated debris of daily habitation.

She had cleared the space systematically.

"She is gone." Zeph moved to the wardrobe and peered inside as though Photine might be hiding behind the empty shelves. "Completely gone. This looks like nobody has lived here in weeks."

"This looks like someone removed all portable possessions within the last twelve hours." Cornelius approached the desk and examined the dust pattern. "Note the outline where a lamp sat. The dust accumulation is minimal—perhaps six to eight hours. She left after transforming Melaina and Niko but before dawn."

"How do you know she did not leave days ago?"

"Because the window latch shows recent operation." Cornelius gestured toward the brass mechanism. "Oil residue here, at the joint. Fresh. She opened this window within the last day, possibly to air the room before departure."

Zeph circled the small space, opening drawers that slid out empty, checking beneath the bed where nothing but dust collected against the wall. "She took everything. We are not going to find anything useful."

"People attempting rapid departure often overlook details. Particularly when managing psychological stress." Cornelius moved to the small hearth set into the exterior wall. Temple regulations required individual heating in senior quarters, and Photine appeared to have used hers recently.

The grate held ash. Not the cold, settled ash of fires long-extinguished, but the particular grey-white powder that indicated recent combustion.

Cornelius knelt and examined the residue without disturbing it. Paper ash. He could identify the substance by texture and the faint pattern of individual page-burns layering atop each other.

She had burned documents before leaving.

"Zeph. I need you to search the wardrobe more carefully. Check for false backs or hidden compartments."

"Why would she have hidden compartments?"

"Because she has been conducting unauthorized medical procedures and likely maintained records she could not store in official Temple files." Cornelius extended one claw and very carefully began sifting through the ash. "People who keep secrets develop systems for protecting those secrets. Search thoroughly."

Behind him, Zeph began tapping the wardrobe's interior walls with the particular rhythm of someone checking for hollow spaces. Cornelius filtered the ash particles, looking for incompletely burned fragments that might retain legible text.

Most of the material had been thoroughly destroyed. Photine had apparently fed pages gradually into the fire rather than dumping everything at once—a methodical approach that ensured complete combustion.

But paper burned unevenly. Corners survived. Fragments protected by surrounding material sometimes escaped the flames.

Cornelius's claw-tip encountered something with more substance than powder. He extracted it carefully—a triangular scrap approximately one inch per side, edges charred black but center portion still bearing ink.

The handwriting was Photine's. He recognized her precise, vertical script from the medical reports he had reviewed in the Temple Archives.

The visible text read: **...passage confirmed for six (6) passengers...**

Cornelius sat back on his haunches, the fragment resting carefully on his palm.

Six passengers.

Not one person fleeing. Not Photine escaping alone.

Six individuals traveling together.

"Found something." Zeph's voice carried the particular brightness that indicated actual discovery rather than speculation. "There is a space behind the back panel. Narrow. Maybe three inches deep."

"What is inside?"

"Nothing now. But the dust pattern shows something was stored here until recently. Rectangular. Maybe the size of a book or a flat box." Zeph emerged from the wardrobe. "You think she was hiding medical records here?"

"I think she was hiding something she needed regular access to but could not risk Temple administration discovering." Cornelius returned his attention to the ash, sifting more carefully. His claws encountered another fragment—this one slightly larger, perhaps two inches long.

The text read: **...Constant Stanza departs fifth bell, dock...**

Cornelius went very still.

Ship name. Departure time. Dock location.

Photine was not simply hiding within the city.

She was fleeing entirely.

Taking five other people with her.

His mind assembled possibilities with terrible speed. Six passengers. Mother Ligeia's message about "the Flower" and "the Healer." The Enclave's siege preparations and armed resistance. Photine's connection to the Kallistos family and her unauthorized treatment of Gorgon patients.

"She is evacuating Enclave leadership," Cornelius said quietly.

Zeph moved closer. "What?"

"Six passengers. Photine plus five others. Mother Ligeia. Possibly Xanthe. Possibly other Enclave organizers." Cornelius stood, the fragments cradled carefully in his palm. "They are abandoning the city before Watch enforcement escalates to violence."

"Wait. You think Mother Ligeia is leaving? She founded the Enclave. She has lived here for decades."

"She has lived here while maintaining community safety and autonomy. The registration protocols eliminate autonomy. The Watch's increasing aggression threatens safety." Cornelius moved to the desk and set the fragments down carefully. "She is protecting her people by removing leadership before they can be arrested or killed."

"But—" Zeph's voice caught. "If they leave, what happens to the Gorgons who stay? The ones who cannot afford to flee or do not have connections to get passage?"

The question hung between them.

Cornelius had no comforting answer.

Abandoning vulnerable populations to institutional violence was not noble.

But ensuring leadership survived to potentially organize future resistance or provide refuge elsewhere might be the only pragmatic option when facing overwhelming force.

He thought of Demos's ledger. The systematic documentation of charity work that bankrupted the Temple. The final entry about securing restricted supplies despite risks.

Sometimes preservation required accepting partial loss rather than total destruction.

"They are making the same calculation Photine made with Melaina," Cornelius said. "Preserve what can be preserved. Transform the salvageable. Accept that complete salvation is impossible with available resources."

"That is horrible."

"That is triage." Cornelius returned to the hearth and continued sifting ash. "Which does not mean we accept it as inevitable. It means we understand the constraints Photine is operating within."

His claw encountered a third fragment. This one was smaller—barely legible. But the visible text made his scales prickle.

**...payment rendered, no questions...**

Smuggler terms.

The *Constant Stanza* was not a legitimate passenger vessel.

It was a ship that transported people without documentation, without manifests, without official records that Watch investigations could trace.

Expensive. Dangerous. The sort of passage desperate people purchased when legal options ceased existing.

"She paid a smuggler." Cornelius set the fragment with the others. "Premium rate for priority boarding and absolute discretion."

"How much would that cost? For six people?"

"More than a Temple healer's salary accumulates. Significantly more." Cornelius stood and moved to the window. Beyond the glass, the city continued its pre-dawn routines. Watch bells marking patrol rotations. Distant market preparations. Normal civic function proceeding while people transformed to stone and community leaders fled prosecution.

The Kallistos family had money.

Photine could have accessed family resources if she convinced them the expenditure was necessary.

Or if she blackmailed them with threats to expose family secrets.

Cornelius thought of Kyra's furtive visits to Photine. Of Demos's notes mentioning "family reputation" as a risk factor. Of Mother Ligeia's pointed comments about selling one's reflection.

What secret was worth bankrupting family accounts to protect?

What truth threatened the Kallistos name badly enough that they would fund an illegal evacuation rather than face exposure?

"We need to find that ship before it departs." Zeph had moved to stand beside the desk, looking at the assembled fragments. "If we can stop Photine from leaving, we can convince her to reverse Demos's petrification."

"If we stop her from leaving, Captain Theo will arrest her for multiple murders and she will be detained before she can perform reversals." Cornelius turned from the window. "We need to intercept her before she boards but after she has evaded Watch detection. Which requires knowing exactly when and where the *Constant Stanza* docks."

"The fragment says fifth bell. That's dawn watch-change. About forty minutes from now."

"Which provides insufficient time to search all dock facilities for an unlisted smuggler vessel." Cornelius moved back to the hearth and resumed searching the ash. "I need more information. Dock number. Specific berth. Something that narrows the location."

He sifted carefully, claw-tips separating powder from potential fragments. Most of the material had burned completely. Photine had been thorough.

But paper was stubborn. Ink sometimes survived. And people under psychological duress made mistakes even when attempting methodical destruction.

His claw encountered something with different texture than paper ash. Smoother. Slightly waxy.

He extracted it carefully.

Wax seal fragment. Dark blue. The partial impression of what might have been a ship or possibly a stylized bird.

"Zeph. What do you know about dock facilities and smuggler operations?"

"Literally nothing. I have never committed crimes before this week."

"What about general maritime logistics? Ship recognition? Harbor navigation?"

"I can identify that boats float. That is the extent of my nautical expertise." Zeph moved closer to examine the wax fragment. "What is that?"

"Seal from official correspondence. Possibly a smuggler captain's personal mark or a dock authority bribe-stamp." Cornelius held it up to catch lamplight. The impression was too incomplete to identify definitively, but the color and wax quality suggested expensive commissioning.

Professional criminal enterprise rather than desperate improvisation.

The *Constant Stanza* had infrastructure. Established systems. Probably regular routes and reliable discretion.

Which meant someone in the city knew how to contact them.

Someone who arranged illegal passage with enough frequency to maintain working relationships with smuggler captains.

Cornelius thought of the Enclave's hidden networks. Of Mother Ligeia's intelligence-gathering systems. Of the parallel healthcare and supply chains that operated beneath Temple and Watch awareness.

Of course the Enclave maintained smuggler contacts.

They would need evacuation options for people fleeing persecution or seeking medical treatment unavailable through official channels.

"We need to reach Mother Ligeia before Photine boards that ship," Cornelius said. "She arranged the passage. She will know the exact location."

"You said she was probably one of the six passengers. She might already be at the dock."

"Then we intercept them there and convince Photine that reversing Demos's petrification is more important than fleeing prosecution." Cornelius moved toward the door, the wax fragment secured carefully in his palm. "Either way, remaining in this room provides no additional information."

He reached for the door latch.

Footsteps echoed in the corridor outside.

Not the hurried pace of emergency response. Not the casual rhythm of routine patrol.

Measured. Deliberate. The particular cadence of someone approaching a specific destination with clear purpose.

Cornelius froze. Behind him, Zeph went completely still.

The footsteps stopped directly outside Photine's door.

Cornelius's mind calculated options rapidly. The window was too small for him to exit quickly. The wardrobe lacked sufficient space to conceal a dragon. Under the bed was undignified and likely ineffective.

They had no legitimate reason to be in this room.

The door latch clicked.

Cornelius grabbed Zeph and pulled them both behind the opening door with the same motion he used to shield fragile manuscripts from falling objects. The space was cramped—barely sufficient to conceal them if the room's occupant entered without conducting thorough searches.

The door swung inward.

Captain Theo entered.

Cornelius held absolutely still. His scales prickled with the particular discomfort of being caught mid-crime by the one person most capable of enforcing consequences.

But Theo did not search the room.

He moved directly to the desk.

His uniform looked rumpled—shirt untucked slightly, jacket unbuttoned. His face showed exhaustion that went beyond missed sleep into genuine emotional fatigue.

He stood at the desk for approximately fifteen seconds without moving. Just staring at the empty surface.

Then he reached into his jacket pocket and withdrew something small.

A wooden carving. Cornelius could not see details from his current angle, but the shape suggested a bird. Possibly a sparrow.

Theo placed it carefully on the desk's center.

His hand lingered there. Fingers spread across wood as though touching something precious through proxy.

"You did the right thing," he said quietly. "Whatever you did. Whatever you were protecting. It was the right thing."

His voice carried none of the professional authority Cornelius associated with Watch captains.

This was personal.

Intimate.

The tone someone used when speaking to absent loved ones.

Theo withdrew his hand and stood for another moment, looking at the carving. Then he turned and walked to the door.

Paused.

Looked back at the small wooden bird sitting alone on the empty desk.

"Come back safe," he said.

Then he left. The door closed behind him with a soft click.

His footsteps retreated down the corridor. Faded. Disappeared.

Cornelius waited until he could no longer detect any sound before moving from behind the door. He approached the desk slowly.

The carving was beautifully made. Detailed feather-work. Careful attention to proportions. The bird's head turned slightly as though listening for something just beyond hearing.

Not professionally commissioned. Hand-carved with the particular imperfections that indicated personal creation rather than purchased craft.

Theo had made this himself.

Had carried it to Photine's empty room.

Had left it as—what? Gift? Apology? Promise?

"He loves her," Zeph whispered. The words carried surprise and something softer. Understanding, perhaps. Or sympathy.

"He has clearly developed emotional attachment that compromises professional objectivity regarding her case." Cornelius examined the carving without touching it. "Which explains why he has not issued formal arrest warrants despite having sufficient evidence to justify detainment."

"That is the least romantic thing you could possibly say."

"I am not attempting romance. I am analyzing investigative implications." But Cornelius's voice lacked its usual certainty.

Because Theo had called what Photine did "the right thing."

Had told her to come back safe.

Had left a gift made with his own hands in her empty room where only desperate hope suggested she might return to find it.

Watch Captain Theo—who had threatened mass Gorgon arrests and enforced discriminatory registration—had also fallen in love with a healer who petrified patients and fled the city to protect them.

Humans were extraordinarily complicated.

"We should leave before he comes back," Zeph said.

"Agreed." Cornelius moved to the hearth and collected the burnt fragments, wrapping them carefully in a handkerchief from the desk drawer. "We have sufficient information to narrow search parameters. Fifth bell departure. Smuggler vessel. Six passengers including Photine and likely Mother Ligeia."

"And you think the Enclave leadership is abandoning everyone else."

"I think they are preserving organizational capacity against overwhelming institutional violence. Whether that constitutes abandonment or strategic retreat depends on whether they intend to establish safe refuge elsewhere or simply disappear." Cornelius moved toward the door. "Either way, we must reach them before that ship departs."

"And convince Photine to stay and reverse Demos's petrification even though that means Watch arrest and probable execution."

"Correct."

"While also somehow protecting her from Theo despite him being the Watch Captain and literally in charge of enforcement."

"Essentially accurate."

"That seems impossible."

Cornelius opened the door and checked the corridor. Empty. He gestured for Zeph to follow.

"It seems improbable," he corrected. "Impossible would require circumstances that preclude any potential solution. We have approximately thirty-five minutes before fifth bell. We have partial location data. We have new intelligence about Theo's compromised objectivity. We have motivation and—"

"New criminal charges," Zeph interrupted. "Breaking and entering. Evidence tampering. Probably a dozen other things."

"Minor additions to our existing violations." Cornelius moved quickly down the corridor toward the dormitory exit. "At this point we have already committed sufficient crimes that adding trespass charges makes minimal difference to eventual prosecution."

"That is not comforting."

"I am not attempting comfort. I am being realistic about our legal status." They reached the stairs and descended quickly. "Focus on priorities. Find Photine. Save Demos. Prevent Enclave leadership from fleeing. Address criminal charges after ensuring no one remains unnecessarily petrified."

They emerged into the Temple's pre-dawn quiet. The clinic wing showed lamplight in a few windows—night shift healers maintaining routine despite crisis.

Somewhere in the city, a smuggler vessel prepared for departure.

Somewhere in that vessel's plans, six passengers waited to disappear.

And somewhere inside failing stone, Brother Demos's biological functions continued degrading toward permanent death.

Cornelius spread his wings.

"The docks," he said. "Harbor district. We find that ship before fifth bell or everyone dies."

He launched himself into the air. Behind him, Zeph ran for the library to collect supplies.

Thirty-three minutes remained.

Human inefficiency was going to kill them all unless Cornelius located one specific unlisted vessel among dozens of legitimate ships in a harbor system designed for exactly the kind of anonymous traffic smugglers required.

He angled toward the waterfront and increased his speed.

The hunt had become a race.

And the clock was running out.

# Chapter 13

# Chapter 13

The concealed entrance to the Gorgon Enclave—a collapsed warehouse facade concealing stairs that descended into the old cistern network—stood unguarded.

Cornelius landed on the cracked paving stones and folded his wings with careful precision. The absence of sentries registered immediately as wrong. During his previous visit, armed Gorgons had challenged him before he reached the actual doorway. Security had been layered, deliberate, prepared for Watch incursion.

Now the threshold gaped empty.

Behind him, Zeph's running footsteps echoed through the pre-dawn quiet. The boy had retrieved supplies from the library and met Cornelius at the warehouse as planned—approximately seven minutes of their remaining time spent on coordination that might prove entirely unnecessary if the Enclave had already evacuated.

"Where are the guards?" Zeph bent forward, hands on knees, catching his breath.

"Excellent question. I am about to determine whether their absence indicates evacuation or ambush." Cornelius moved toward the entrance, scales prickling with the particular awareness that accompanied entering potentially hostile territory. "Remain behind me. If violence occurs, retreat immediately."

"You keep saying that like I would run toward danger instead of away from it."

"You have demonstrated concerning willingness to engage in confrontation despite being an unarmed human adolescent." Cornelius descended the stairs, claws clicking against stone worn smooth by decades of foot traffic. "I am merely establishing clear protocols for potential emergency scenarios."

The stairs curved downward into dimness. Lamps usually illuminated this passage every twenty feet—oil fixtures maintained by Enclave residents to guide safe navigation through the cistern network. Currently, most stood dark. Only every fourth lamp showed flame, and those burned low, wicks trimmed to minimal output.

Emergency lighting. The bare minimum required to prevent total darkness.

Cornelius's eyes adjusted easily—dragon vision functioned well in limited illumination. But the shadows felt wrong. Too many. Too deep. The cisterns had possessed specific acoustic character during his last visit—distant voices echoing through stone corridors, the particular resonance of occupied space.

Now he heard only his own claws and Zeph's careful footsteps.

Silence pressed against his eardrums with physical weight.

They reached the first junction where the entrance passage connected to the main cistern chamber. Cornelius paused at the threshold, extending his awareness outward through the sensory information available.

No cooking smoke. No voices. No movement except the faint drip of condensation from ceiling stones into standing pools.

He entered the main chamber slowly.

The Gorgon Enclave had occupied this space for decades, transforming ancient water storage into livable community infrastructure. During Cornelius's previous investigation, the cistern had bustled with activity—families preparing meals over small braziers, children playing in alcoves carved into the walls, artisans working at tables lit by carefully positioned lamps.

Now the chamber stretched vast and empty.

Cornelius moved deeper inside, his analytical assessment cataloging details with the same precision he applied to damaged manuscripts requiring restoration documentation.

The fires were not merely extinguished. They had been properly doused, coals scattered and cooled, ash swept into neat piles ready for disposal. Bedrolls had been removed entirely—not abandoned in hasty flight but packed systematically. Furniture remained, but lighter items were gone. The tables stood in organized rows, but no tools cluttered their surfaces. Shelves built into alcoves showed gaps where personal possessions had been removed with care.

This was not panicked evacuation.

This was methodical departure.

"They left." Zeph's voice echoed strangely in the empty space. "When? How did we not know?"

"Because Mother Ligeia is significantly more competent than I credited." Cornelius approached one of the alcove-shelves and examined the dust patterns. Light layer, perhaps two days' accumulation. "They began evacuating approximately forty-eight to seventy-two hours ago. Possibly longer for initial groups."

"But we saw them. Guard patrols. Xanthe preparing weapons. Ligeia talking about protecting people."

"We saw exactly what Ligeia intended us to see." Cornelius moved to another alcove, checking for overlooked items. "A small defensive presence maintaining visible occupation while the actual population departed in careful stages."

The realization assembled itself with terrible elegance. Cornelius had interpreted the Enclave's siege preparations as defensive fortification—armed guards, barricaded entrances, militant rhetoric about resisting Watch persecution. But those preparations had not been defense.

They had been theater.

Misdirection designed to focus Watch attention on the cisterns while actual evacuation proceeded elsewhere.

Zeph climbed onto one of the tables and sat with his legs dangling. "So where did everyone go? That many people cannot just disappear."

"They can if departures are staggered across multiple days using different routes through prearranged smuggler networks." Cornelius examined the main brazier area. "Ligeia has likely maintained evacuation contingencies for years. Underground passages connecting to harbor districts. Sympathetic ship captains willing to transport undocumented passengers. Safe houses in other cities."

"That would cost a fortune. How would they pay for it?"

Excellent question.

Cornelius thought of the burnt fragments from Photine's room. Six passengers at premium smuggler rates. The expensive dark blue wax seal suggesting established criminal infrastructure rather than desperate improvisation.

He thought of the Enclave's population during his previous visit. Hundreds of residents. Families. Elderly community members. Children too young for dangerous travel.

Evacuating that many people would require resources beyond anything standard Temple salaries or Enclave craftwork could accumulate.

"Community pooling," Cornelius said slowly. "Donations from Gorgons who escaped persecution in other cities and sent money back. Possibly Temple charity funds that Demos redirected. Ligeia has been planning this for months. Possibly years."

"Demos was helping fund this?" Zeph's voice rose. "He bankrupted the Temple to save Gorgons, and now they used that money to leave?"

"He bankrupted the Temple to provide medical care and survival resources to marginalized populations facing institutional violence. If some of those resources funded evacuation to safety, that aligns with his apparent priorities." Cornelius moved toward the deeper cistern passages, following the faint lamplight that marked continued navigation paths. "The question is whether Photine had access to those same funds for her own escape."

He already suspected the answer.

Demos had spent everything. The ledger had documented systematic resource depletion—medicines purchased, bandages distributed, house calls conducted without payment. Three months of charity work that drained Temple accounts to critical levels.

And Photine had covered for him. Had compensated where possible. Had hidden the spending from Temple administration while the financial crisis deepened.

She would not have simultaneously been building personal evacuation funds.

Which meant she was fleeing with whatever resources she could scrape together at the last moment.

Which meant she might not have enough to actually secure passage.

Cornelius stopped walking. The deduction settled with uncomfortable clarity.

Six passengers. The *Constant Stanza*. Fifth bell departure.

Professional smuggler operations charged premium rates for undocumented transport. Cornelius had no direct experience with illegal passage pricing, but basic economic logic suggested significant cost—particularly for priority departure during heightened Watch enforcement.

Photine was a Temple healer. Her salary provided comfortable living but not accumulated wealth. And she had just spent weeks secretly treating quarantined patients, burning through restricted supplies, petrifying people to preserve them against degenerative magical disease.

She possessed medical expertise.

She possessed desperate motivation.

She did not possess gold.

"We need to reach the docks immediately." Cornelius turned and moved back toward the exit with increased speed. "Photine will be unable to pay for passage. She will be stranded at the harbor while the *Constant Stanza* departs without her."

Zeph jumped down from the table and followed. "Wait. You think she does not have money? Then why burn those documents about the ship?"

"Because the documents connected her to illegal smuggler operations and potentially implicated Mother Ligeia's evacuation network. She destroyed evidence that could trigger Watch investigations into the broader refugee movement." Cornelius took the stairs upward two at a time. "But destroying evidence is separate from possessing adequate financing."

They emerged into the pre-dawn air. The city continued its mechanical routines—distant bells marking patrol rotations, early merchants beginning market preparations. Normal civic function while crisis accelerated beneath institutional awareness.

Cornelius spread his wings, then paused.

The problem was not simply reaching Photine.

The problem was providing resources she needed while operating under severe time constraints with no access to conventional banking or legitimate currency exchange.

He could not withdraw Temple funds—that required authorization he did not possess and time he did not have.

He could not access civic emergency reserves—those required Council approval.

He could steal gold from Watch evidence storage or Temple donation boxes, but theft required time for planning and execution that exceeded their remaining margin.

He needed liquid assets.

Immediately negotiable value.

Something he could convert to gold within minutes rather than hours.

Cornelius thought of his hoard. The rare volumes secreted throughout the library in hidden spaces designed for exactly this kind of resource preservation. Books were not instantly liquid—selling them properly required authentication, appraisal, auction arrangements.

But selling them improperly just required finding a buyer willing to pay immediately for obviously genuine rare editions without asking difficult questions about provenance.

The black market book trade operated in every major city. Collectors who acquired restricted texts through unofficial channels. Merchants who purchased estate liquidations without excessive documentation requirements.

Cornelius knew three such dealers in Solterra Bay's commercial district.

And he possessed one volume valuable enough to generate the gold Photine needed.

*The Chronicles of the Founding. First Edition. Complete with original illumination and the Founder's personal annotations.*

The centerpiece of his hoard. The text he had protected for decades against institutional demands and civic emergencies. The one book he had sworn never to sell regardless of circumstances.

The book worth enough to fund illegal passage for six people on a smuggler vessel with no manifest and no questions.

His scales prickled. The sensation was not the external warning of danger but rather internal conflict between his preservation instincts and his recent recognition that hoarding prevented rather than protected.

Demos had spent everything to save people.

Photine had destroyed her career to preserve dying patients.

Cornelius had spent weeks investigating their sacrifices while maintaining his own hoard against theoretical future need.

The parallel was uncomfortable.

And increasingly indefensible.

"Zeph." Cornelius turned to face his assistant. "I need you to go directly to the harbor district. Search for the *Constant Stanza*. It will be docked at a berth used for cargo rather than passenger vessels—smugglers avoid terminals with heavy Watch presence."

"What are you going to do?"

"I am going to convert assets to currency." Cornelius did not specify which assets. The admission would require explanation he lacked time to provide. "When you locate Photine, explain that I will arrive with the necessary gold before fifth bell. Do not let that ship depart until I reach the dock."

"How am I supposed to stop a ship?"

"Diplomatic negotiation. Physical obstruction if necessary." Cornelius knew this was asking a sixteen-year-old human to interfere with professional criminals, but alternatives were limited. "Use your judgment regarding appropriate intervention levels."

"That is the worst instruction you have ever given me."

"I am operating under severe time pressure and trusting your demonstrated capacity for creative problem-solving." Cornelius adjusted his spectacles. "Go. Now. We have approximately thirty-one minutes before fifth bell."

Zeph hesitated. "What if I cannot find the right ship? The harbor has dozens of vessels."

"Then we fail and Demos dies and Photine is arrested and Melaina remains stone permanently." Cornelius gestured toward the harbor district with one wing. "Which is why you are going to locate that ship and prevent its departure through whatever means prove necessary."

"No pressure then."

"Enormous pressure. But you have thus far demonstrated surprising competence despite your youth and species limitations." Cornelius spread his wings fully, preparing for flight. "I have confidence in your ability to accomplish objectives when properly motivated by impending disaster."

"Again—not comforting."

"Comfort is not the priority. Success is the priority. Go."

Zeph went—running toward the harbor with the particular speed of someone operating on adrenaline and desperate hope.

Cornelius angled toward the commercial district and launched himself upward. The pre-dawn sky showed the first traces of approaching sunrise—not visible light yet, but the particular quality of darkness that indicated imminent transition.

Fifth bell would ring when dawn watch change commenced. Approximately thirty minutes remained.

Not enough time to negotiate careful sale.

Not enough time to arrange proper appraisal.

Barely enough time to locate a dealer, present the book, accept whatever price they offered, and transport gold to the docks before the *Constant Stanza* departed.

Cornelius flew faster.

Below him, the city's architecture transitioned from residential districts to commercial zones. The commercial district woke earlier than other areas—merchants preparing inventory, bakers firing ovens, craftspeople beginning skilled work that required full daylight for precision.

And book dealers who maintained both legitimate storefronts and unofficial back-room operations for restricted texts acquired through questionable channels.

Cornelius descended toward a familiar building near the main market square. Three stories. Stone construction. Ground floor housed a respectable antiquarian bookshop. Upper floors contained private acquisition rooms where collectors examined rare editions away from public scrutiny.

He landed in the alley behind the building and folded his wings.

The back entrance was locked—expected at this hour. But Cornelius knew the proprietor lived above the shop, and book dealers who specialized in unofficial acquisitions maintained flexible hours for clients requiring discretion.

He knocked.

Waited.

Knocked again with increased force.

A window opened on the second floor. A man's face appeared—middle-aged, showing the particular annoyed expression of someone woken before intended.

"We are closed. Return during business hours."

"I have a first edition *Chronicles of the Founding* that requires immediate sale." Cornelius kept his voice level. "I can provide authentication and am willing to accept below-market pricing in exchange for instant gold payment."

The face disappeared. Cornelius heard footsteps descending interior stairs.

The door opened.

The dealer—a human named Marcus Varen who specialized in historical texts and had purchased several of Cornelius's less precious volumes during past library culls—stood wrapped in a dressing gown, holding a lamp.

"You have the *Chronicles*?" His expression shifted from annoyed to intensely interested. "The Founder's annotated copy? I thought that was in your permanent collection."

"It was. Now it requires conversion to portable currency." Cornelius did not enter despite the opened door. "I need gold. Immediately. Whatever rate you consider fair for emergency sale."

Marcus studied him for a long moment. "How much gold do we need to generate?"

Cornelius calculated rapidly. Six passengers at professional smuggler rates during heightened enforcement. No manifest fees. Priority departure. Absolute discretion.

"Three thousand standard weight." The number felt obscene. But smugglers charging wealthy clients for desperate circumstances would demand premium pricing. "Possibly four thousand to ensure coverage including unexpected fees."

Marcus whistled softly. "That is substantial liquidation. The *Chronicles* could bring that amount at proper auction with authentication time and collector bidding. But emergency sale with no provenance verification?" He paused. "I can offer two thousand immediately. Perhaps twenty-five hundred if I contact a collector I know who has been seeking that specific edition."

Two thousand was insufficient. Twenty-five hundred was marginal.

"Contact your collector," Cornelius said. "Tell them I am offering the genuine Founder's annotated *Chronicles*, complete original illumination, perfect condition, available for immediate cash purchase with no documentation or auction delays."

"They will want authentication."

"I will provide my personal certification as Library Dragon and include three reference texts that establish my expertise in manuscript verification. They can examine the volume here while I wait. But the entire transaction must complete within twenty minutes."

Marcus's expression suggested he found this timeline ambitious but not impossible. "Wait in the back room. I will send a runner and prepare verification materials."

He disappeared into the building. Cornelius heard rapid movement—footsteps, drawers opening, the particular sounds of urgent preparation.

Cornelius remained in the alley, unwilling to enter until necessary. His scales were doing the uncomfortable prickling thing that indicated internal conflict rather than external threat.

He was about to sell his most valued possession.

The book he had hoarded for decades.

The text that represented everything his preservation instinct protected—rare knowledge, irreplaceable historical documentation, beautiful craftsmanship, cultural heritage.

He was selling it to fund criminal activity by a fugitive healer who had broken multiple laws and petrified three people including a Temple junior healer currently dying inside unstable stone.

The logic should have made him reconsider.

Instead, it crystallized his certainty.

Demos had spent everything—his salary, his savings, his health, ultimately his biological integrity—to preserve lives the Temple's systems excluded.

Cornelius had spent decades accumulating books while congratulating himself for good stewardship.

One of them had actually preserved something that mattered.

The other had simply hoarded.

The distinction was becoming painfully clear.

Marcus returned to the doorway. "My runner is fetching the collector. They will arrive within fifteen minutes. Bring the book inside—we need to prepare authentication documentation."

Cornelius spread his wings. "I must retrieve it from the library first. I will return within seven minutes."

"Seven—that is barely enough time to fly there and back."

"Then I will fly quickly." Cornelius launched himself upward before Marcus could protest further.

The library rose in the distance—familiar stone dome, careful architecture, the physical representation of everything Cornelius had spent his life protecting. He descended through his private entrance window and moved directly to his study.

His hoard did not gather in one location. That would be poor security. Instead, precious volumes were distributed throughout the building in hidden spaces only Cornelius could access easily—behind false shelf-backs, under removable floor tiles, inside hollowed sections of decorative columns.

*The Chronicles of the Founding* occupied a climate-controlled compartment beneath his sleeping roost. The location was deliberately inconvenient to discourage casual access while maintaining optimal preservation environment.

Cornelius removed the floor panel and extracted the volume with careful claws.

Leather binding. Gold leaf still bright on the spine. Pages that smelled of aged parchment and expensive ink. The Founder's handwriting visible in margin notes throughout the text.

Beautiful.

Irreplaceable.

Worth less than Photine's freedom and Demos's survival.

He wrapped it carefully in protective cloth and secured it in a carrying satchel.

Then he flew back to Marcus Varen's shop and sold his hoard.

# Chapter 14

# Chapter 14

The Eel & Tankard smelled of anise and desperation.

Cornelius perched on a bench that wobbled when he settled his weight, the satchel containing his most precious possession resting against his side. The tavern occupied the worst corner of the harbor district—a building battered by decades of sea spray, its timbers dark with moisture and neglect. Oil lamps burned low despite the noon hour, casting uncertain light across tables scarred by knife-marks and spilled drinks.

This was not the sort of establishment that appeared in respectable commercial directories.

Which made it exactly the sort of place where transactions requiring discretion occurred without excessive documentation.

Cornelius adjusted his spectacles and surveyed the interior with the same analytical precision he applied to cataloging damaged manuscripts. Three tables occupied by dock workers consuming bowls of fish stew that smelled aggressively of garlic. A bartender polishing glasses with a cloth that appeared less clean than the glasses themselves. A back corner booth draped with a privacy curtain that suggested regular use for unofficial business.

The curtain twitched.

A figure emerged—tall, human, dressed in expensive but understated clothing that managed to look both prosperous and forgettable. Lord Vane. Not his actual title, Cornelius suspected, but rather an affectation adopted for exactly these sorts of meetings.

The collector approached with the careful movements of someone accustomed to operating in spaces where Watch presence was minimal and violence remained a commercial possibility.

"You brought it?" His voice matched his appearance—cultured but deliberately neutral.

Cornelius placed one claw on the satchel. "I brought verification materials and the item itself. Marcus Varen indicated you required immediate authentication before finalizing purchase terms."

"Marcus said you were in a hurry." Lord Vane settled onto the opposite bench without invitation. "Hurried sales usually mean stolen goods or desperate sellers. Which are you?"

"I am a Library Dragon liquidating personal assets to fund time-sensitive charitable works." Cornelius kept his tone level despite his scales prickling with irritation at the implication of theft. "The provenance is impeccable. The item has been in my private collection for one hundred and seven years. I acquired it through legitimate estate auction with full documentation."

"But you are not providing that documentation now."

"I am providing my personal certification as an expert in historical manuscripts and my professional reputation as curator of the city's largest archival collection." Cornelius lifted the satchel onto the table. "If my verification is insufficient, we can terminate negotiations and I will pursue alternative buyers."

Lord Vane's expression did not change, but his hands moved with increased interest toward the satchel. "Show me."

Cornelius unwrapped the protective cloth with careful claws. The Chronicles of the Founding emerged in layers—first the leather binding, then the gold leaf spine, finally the full magnificence of the Founder's annotated first edition.

The book seemed to absorb lamplight rather than reflect it. Pages thick with age and careful preservation. Margins dense with handwritten notes in the Founder's distinctive script. Illuminated capitals still bright with pigments that cost more than most families earned in lifetimes.

Lord Vane reached toward it, then paused. "May I?"

"You may examine it carefully. The binding is sound but the pages require gentle handling." Cornelius watched as the collector lifted the book with the particular reverence that indicated genuine scholarship rather than simple acquisition.

Lord Vane opened to a random page. Read the printed text. Read the marginal annotations. Looked up at Cornelius with an expression that suggested he had expected something valuable but not something this valuable.

"This is authentic."

"Obviously."

"The marginalia—these are the Founder's actual strategic notes. Commentary on the campaign recordkeeping methods. Criticism of the original chronicler's bias regarding the mountain campaigns." Lord Vane turned pages with increasing care. "I have read published excerpts of these annotations but I thought the original manuscript was lost."

"It was believed lost because I did not advertise its presence in my collection." Cornelius kept his voice steady despite the uncomfortable sensation spreading through his chest. Watching someone else handle his most precious volume felt like allowing a stranger to examine his internal organs. "I preferred to maintain discretionary ownership rather than deal with institutional acquisition demands."

"Smart." Lord Vane continued his examination. "The illumination is original. No restoration work. Binding is period-appropriate. The paper shows characteristic aging patterns consistent with the documented publication date." He looked up. "This is worth significantly more than the twenty-five hundred Marcus mentioned."

"I am aware." Cornelius folded his wings tight against his sides—the physical equivalent of steadying himself. "However, I require liquid currency within the next fifteen minutes rather than optimal auction pricing over several months. Therefore I am willing to accept below-market rates in exchange for immediate gold payment and minimal transaction documentation."

Lord Vane set the book down carefully. "How much do you actually need?"

The question was more direct than Cornelius had anticipated. He recalculated his approach. This was a negotiation, and negotiations required accurate assessment of counterpart motivations.

Lord Vane was a collector who had just been offered something he likely never expected to acquire.

Collectors operating in black markets prided themselves on securing items other buyers could not access.

This book represented a significant addition to any serious collection—and the opportunity to purchase it would not recur.

"I require five hundred gold crowns," Cornelius said. "Standard weight. Immediately negotiable currency accepted at harbor businesses and by professional smugglers."

Lord Vane's eyebrows rose. "That is substantially less than this book's worth."

"I am aware. But I am not conducting a standard commercial transaction. I am converting a non-portable asset into immediate working capital under severe time constraints." Cornelius kept his claws visible on the table—showing he was not reaching for weapons or attempting concealment. "I need gold. You want the book. We can complete our business and part ways within five minutes."

"Or I could offer you eight hundred and you could fund your charitable works more completely."

Cornelius paused. His analytical mind immediately calculated implications. Eight hundred gold crowns was closer to actual auction value for a volume this rare. It would cover not just Photine's passage but also medical supplies, potential bribes, emergency contingencies.

It would also delay the transaction while Lord Vane arranged for that much additional currency.

"How quickly can you produce eight hundred crowns?" Cornelius asked.

"I carry three hundred in my secured case. The rest I can have delivered here within thirty minutes."

Thirty minutes exceeded their time margin. The Constant Stanza departed at fifth bell. Zeph was currently attempting to locate and delay a smuggler vessel using nothing but adolescent determination and questionable judgment.

Cornelius needed to reach the docks immediately, not wait for delayed payment.

"Five hundred," he repeated. "Available now. Non-negotiable timeline."

Lord Vane studied him for a long moment. Then nodded slowly. "You are actually trying to save someone. This is not business. This is personal."

"My motivations are irrelevant to our transaction."

"They are relevant to whether I respect you enough to provide fair value despite your desperation." Lord Vane reached into his jacket and withdrew a leather case. "I will give you six hundred. Three hundred now in coin. Three hundred more in a letter of credit accepted by Marcus Varen and two other dealers I know you have worked with previously. You can convert that to physical gold within an hour at any of their establishments."

Cornelius's scales stopped their uncomfortable prickling. Six hundred crowns. Enough to secure passage, bribe dock officials if necessary, and maintain emergency reserves.

And Lord Vane was offering fair value when he could have exploited the time pressure to demand the book for half that amount.

"Why?" Cornelius asked.

"Because I collect beautiful things and you are destroying yourself to save someone." Lord Vane opened his case and began counting coins onto the table. "I appreciate beauty but I understand priorities. Take the six hundred. Save whoever needs saving. And know the Chronicles will be preserved properly."

The coins accumulated in neat stacks. Heavy gold crowns, each stamped with the city's harbor seal. Legitimate currency accepted throughout the commercial districts.

Cornelius watched his hoard convert into portable assets.

The sensation should have been devastating. He had protected this book for more than a century. Had kept it hidden from institutional demands and civic emergencies. Had sworn never to sell it regardless of circumstances.

Now he was trading it for gold to fund the escape of a Temple healer who had petrified three people.

The equation should have felt wrong.

Instead, it felt like shedding uncomfortable weight.

Lord Vane finished counting and produced a letter of credit from his case. "Three hundred in coin. Three hundred in verified letter. Marcus will confirm the signature." He pushed both toward Cornelius. "Do we have agreement?"

Cornelius looked at the gold. Looked at the book. Looked at Lord Vane's expression, which showed genuine respect rather than predatory satisfaction.

"We have agreement." Cornelius transferred the coins into his satchel with careful claws. The weight settled satisfyingly—heavy enough to represent real value, portable enough to transport quickly. "The book is yours."

Lord Vane wrapped it carefully in the protective cloth and secured it in his own carrying case. "I will preserve it properly. Climate-controlled storage. Minimal handling. It will outlast both of us."

"That is all preservation requires." Cornelius stood, the satchel secured against his side. "Thank you for fair dealing despite my compromised negotiating position."

"Thank you for trusting me with something you clearly valued." Lord Vane remained seated, his case resting on the bench beside him. "Good luck with your rescue operation."

Cornelius turned toward the door.

Paused.

Looked back at the collector holding his most precious possession.

"The Founder's note on page forty-seven," Cornelius said quietly. "About the importance of knowing when to spend resources rather than hoard them. Read that section when you have time."

Lord Vane's expression showed surprise. "I will."

Cornelius left the Eel & Tankard and emerged into the harbor district's noise and activity. The weight in his satchel pulled different than the weight of the book had. Less precious. More useful.

He had sold his hoard.

And the city had not collapsed.

His collection had not lost meaning.

The library would not fall into chaos.

He had simply converted one form of value into another—and this form could save actual lives instead of sitting in climate-controlled storage beneath his roost.

The realization settled with unexpected clarity.

Preservation was not the same as hoarding.

Sometimes preserving what mattered required spending what you valued.

Cornelius spread his wings and launched himself toward the Temple district. He needed to collect Imelda and proceed to the harbor. Zeph would be attempting to delay smugglers with nothing but desperate creativity. Photine would be stranded somewhere trying to negotiate passage she could not afford.

And Demos remained dying inside unstable stone with perhaps hours remaining before biological degradation became irreversible.

The gold in Cornelius's satchel represented their margin between salvation and permanent loss.

He flew faster.

—

The Temple's administrative wing was quieter than Cornelius had ever experienced it. He landed in the courtyard and folded his wings, the satchel's weight a constant reminder of his transaction's success and cost.

Imelda's office occupied the second floor—a workspace she had maintained since becoming the Temple's primary liaison for medical supply documentation. During previous visits, the space had bustled with junior administrators managing inventory logs and procurement schedules.

Now the outer office stood empty.

Cornelius moved through deserted corridors toward Imelda's private workspace. The door was closed, which was unusual. Imelda preferred accessibility and maintained open-door policies during working hours.

He knocked carefully with one claw.

No response.

He knocked again.

A sound emerged from inside. Not words. Something that might have been breathing except it carried too much weight. Too much grief.

Cornelius opened the door.

Imelda sat at her desk with her face in her hands, shoulders shaking with the particular rhythm that indicated sustained crying. Papers were scattered across the desktop in unusual disorder. Her ink-stained fingers pressed against her temples as though physically holding herself together.

Cornelius had never seen her cry.

In one hundred and twenty-seven years, he had never witnessed Imelda Kassiani lose composure.

"Imelda." He closed the door behind himself and moved closer. "What has happened? Is someone else petrified? Has the Watch escalated enforcement actions?"

She looked up. Her face showed tear-tracks and the particular redness that indicated extended weeping rather than momentary distress.

"I found his financial records." Her voice was rough, broken by the kind of crying that hurt the throat. "Demos's actual personal finances. Not the Temple ledger. His private accounts."

Cornelius set the satchel on a clear section of desk and waited. Sometimes silence provided better support than words.

Imelda pulled one of the scattered papers toward her. "He sold everything. His furniture. His books. The family jewelry his mother left him. His winter cloak." She touched the paper with one shaking finger. "He sold his burial plot."

The words took a moment to register.

Burial plots in the city's memorial gardens cost substantial sums. They represented family legacy and social status. They provided eternal rest in maintained, consecrated ground rather than anonymous interment in common fields.

Most people acquired burial plots decades before death—securing permanent resting places while still healthy and financially stable.

Demos had been twenty-eight years old.

He should have owned his plot for years.

And he had sold it.

"When?" Cornelius asked quietly.

"Three months ago. The same week the fever cases started appearing in the Gorgon Quarter." Imelda's voice broke again. "He sold his own grave to buy medicine for people who could not pay. Who the Temple refused to treat because they lacked funds or proper documentation or—"

She could not finish the sentence.

Cornelius understood.

Demos had sold the guarantee of his own eternal rest to provide temporary relief for people the institutions had already written off as acceptable losses.

He had spent literally everything—including his eventual death—to preserve lives now.

"I taught him preservation principles," Imelda said. Her hands were shaking again. "When he started as junior healer, I supervised his inventory management training. I taught him about resource allocation and sustainable distribution and long-term institutional stability. And he learned all of it and then ignored every principle because people were dying and he could not—he could not—"

Her voice broke completely.

Cornelius climbed onto the desk and sat beside the scattered papers. His analytical mind wanted to catalog the financial records, to understand exactly what Demos had sacrificed and when. But his emotional awareness recognized that Imelda did not need investigation.

She needed someone to acknowledge that her student had been better than his teachers.

"You taught him preservation," Cornelius said carefully. "He understood the lesson. He simply applied it to people rather than resources."

"He had nothing left." Imelda pressed her ink-stained hands against her face again. "When they find his body—when the reversal fails or when we are too late or when—he will not even have a grave. They will put him in common ground with criminals and paupers and—"

"We are not going to be too late." Cornelius nudged the satchel toward her with one claw. "I sold the Chronicles. Six hundred gold crowns. Enough to secure Photine's passage and cooperation. Enough to bribe dock officials if necessary. Enough to fund the reversal procedure and any emergency medical intervention Demos requires afterward."

Imelda looked up. Her expression showed shock beneath the grief. "You sold the Chronicles? Your Chronicles? The Founder's annotated edition you swore you would never—"

"I sold it to someone who will preserve it properly while I use the proceeds to preserve something more important." Cornelius adjusted his spectacles. "Demos spent his burial plot on fever medicine. I spent my hoard on his survival. The mathematics seem appropriate."

Imelda stared at him for a long moment. Then she started crying again—but different this time. Less grief. More complicated emotions that included gratitude and pride and exhaustion and hope.

She reached out and rested one ink-stained hand on Cornelius's head, the same gesture she had used when he was a hatchling and needed comfort.

"You are growing up," she said quietly. "Finally. After only one hundred and twenty-seven years."

"I am adapting my resource management principles to accommodate new priorities." But Cornelius did not pull away from her hand. "We should proceed to the harbor. Zeph is currently attempting to delay professional smugglers without adult supervision or adequate planning."

"How much time do we have?"

Cornelius calculated rapidly. His transaction with Lord Vane had consumed approximately twenty minutes. Transit time to the Temple had taken another ten. Current time was approximately thirty-eight minutes past the hour before fifth bell.

"Twenty-two minutes before the Constant Stanza departs," he said. "Possibly less if the captain decides early departure is safer than adhering to schedule."

Imelda stood and collected the financial records into organized stacks with practiced efficiency despite her emotional state. She secured them in a desk drawer and locked it with hands that had stopped shaking.

"Then we go," she said. "We find Photine. We save Demos. And we make sure that boy gets a proper burial plot when he dies of old age in sixty years rather than next week inside stone."

Cornelius picked up the satchel. The gold crowns clinked softly with realistic weight.

"He will not need a grave," he said. "Because we are not going to let him die."

Imelda looked at him with an expression that mixed hope and pain. "You cannot promise that."

"No. But I can promise we will spend everything trying. Which appears to be the lesson Demos was attempting to teach." Cornelius moved toward the door. "Are you capable of flight? We can reach the harbor faster if you ride rather than run."

"I have not ridden a dragon in eighty years."

"Then you are overdue for refresher experience." Cornelius exited the office and moved toward the courtyard exit. Behind him, Imelda followed with the particular determined pace that indicated she had converted grief into action.

They emerged into the courtyard together. Cornelius crouched to allow her to mount between his wings. She settled with practiced balance, her weight familiar despite the decades since she had last needed aerial transport.

"Hold securely," Cornelius said. "I am going to fly faster than is strictly advisable given civilian passenger safety protocols."

"I helped raise you from an egg. I am aware of your tendency toward dramatic velocity." Imelda's hands gripped the ridge of scales along his spine. "Go."

Cornelius launched himself upward with enough force to clear the courtyard walls in a single leap. The city spread beneath them—stone buildings and civic architecture and the distant harbor where desperate people waited for ships that promised escape.

The satchel bounced against his side with every wing-stroke.

Six hundred gold crowns.

The price of his hoard.

The cost of preservation.

The weight of choosing people over books after spending a century choosing books over people.

Cornelius angled toward the harbor and increased his speed.

Behind him, Imelda held on and possibly started crying again—or possibly just pressed her face against his scales and allowed wind to blur tears she could not afford to acknowledge while time ran out.

Below them, the city continued its normal functions, unaware that in approximately twenty minutes, a smuggler ship would attempt to depart carrying a fugitive healer who represented their only chance of reversing three separate petrifications before permanence set in.

Cornelius flew faster.

The chase was not finished.

But at least now they had resources.

Human problems, he reflected, required human solutions.

Sometimes that meant selling your hoard.

Sometimes that meant selling your grave.

Sometimes preservation required destroying the things you had spent lifetimes protecting.

The harbor rushed closer.

Cornelius did not slow down.

# Chapter 15

The Temple Archives smelled of dust and abandonment.

Cornelius landed in the basement corridor with more force than was strictly necessary, his claws scraping against stone worn smooth by decades of foot traffic. The satchel bounced against his side—three hundred gold crowns in physical currency plus Lord Vane's letter of credit. The weight felt wrong. Too heavy. Too cold. Books had mass but they carried it differently, distributed across bound pages with the particular heft of preserved knowledge.

Gold just sat there being expensive.

Behind him, Zeph descended the stairs at a pace that suggested exhaustion despite the boy's youth. They had split from Imelda at the Temple courtyard three minutes earlier. She had continued toward the harbor docks on foot while Cornelius and Zeph diverted here for what Cornelius kept telling himself was a necessary final verification.

"Why are we here?" Zeph leaned against the corridor wall and pushed hair out of his eyes. "I thought we were racing the clock. The Constant Stanza leaves in twenty minutes."

"Nineteen minutes." Cornelius moved toward the Archive chamber door. "And we are here because I realized we have been operating on incomplete information regarding Demos's final activities before his petrification."

"You said you already searched this room. Chapter Two. You found sandalwood and determined petrification mechanics and concluded someone skilled attacked him."

"I searched for evidence of the attack itself. I did not conduct thorough examination of his personal workspace or effects." Cornelius pushed the door open with one claw. "Photine burned documents in her dormitory. Mother Ligeia evacuated the Enclave and left minimal traces. Every actor in this crisis has been destroying evidence systematically."

"So you think Demos might have left something?"

"I think Demos was constitutionally incapable of systematic evidence destruction due to his organic approach to record-keeping." Cornelius entered the Archive chamber and paused.

The room looked exactly as he remembered from his initial investigation. Stone walls. Wooden shelving units holding decades of administrative ledgers. The small desk where Demos had worked on routine filing tasks. And in the corner, carefully covered with protective cloth, the stone figure that had been Brother Demos.

The statue showed him mid-reach toward a shelf, one hand extended for the birth ledger he had been filing when the transformation occurred. His expression remained frozen in that moment of mundane concentration. No fear. No awareness that his biological functions were slowly degrading toward permanent cessation inside unstable petrification.

Cornelius looked away. The statue was evidence and medical emergency simultaneously, and his mind kept trying to catalog it as both categories at once in a way that made his scales prickle with discomfort.

"His desk," Cornelius said. "Search the desk drawers and any personal storage he maintained here. Look for sealed documents, unusual papers, anything that appears deliberately preserved rather than routine filing."

Zeph moved to the desk without argument. The boy had stopped questioning Cornelius's investigative instincts approximately four crimes ago.

Cornelius approached the shelving units and examined the birth ledgers with careful attention. Demos had filed these records regularly as part of Temple administrative duties. The ledgers documented all births occurring under Temple healer supervision—which meant most births in the city, since home births without medical assistance carried significant mortality risk.

Each ledger covered a specific year. The spines showed dates in neat script. The organization was bureaucratically perfect despite Demos's personal chaos.

Cornelius pulled the ledger for the year corresponding to Melaina's age and opened it carefully. The pages showed entries in multiple hands—different healers documenting different births throughout the year. Names, dates, attending healer, any complications, official witness signatures.

He scanned the entries methodically. The Gorgon births were marked with a small notation in the margin—a shorthand symbol that likely corresponded to species designation for record-keeping purposes.

Four Gorgon births that year.

None listed the mother's name as Photine Kallistos.

Cornelius closed the ledger and returned it to its position. The absence was notable but not conclusive. Home births among wealthier families occurred occasionally when mothers preferred privacy. Or the birth could have been registered under false information. Or conducted entirely outside official channels.

"Found something." Zeph's voice carried from the desk. "There is a locked drawer. Bottom left. The lock looks new."

Cornelius moved to examine the desk. Standard Temple furniture—simple wood construction, four drawers on the right side, two larger drawers on the left. The bottom left drawer showed a recently installed lock. The wood around the lock plate was cleaner than surrounding surfaces, suggesting installation within the past few months.

"Can you pick it?" Zeph asked.

"I am a Library Dragon, not a criminal." Cornelius examined the lock mechanism. "However, I possess certain skills that prove useful for accessing restricted archive materials during legitimate research contexts."

"So yes, you can pick it."

"I can manipulate simple mechanical locks using appropriately sized tools." Cornelius extracted two thin claws and inserted them into the lock mechanism. "The distinction is ethically significant even if the practical outcome appears similar."

The lock clicked open.

Cornelius pulled the drawer. Inside lay a small wooden box—the sort used for storing important personal documents. The box was not locked but the lid fit tightly enough to suggest deliberate sealing.

He lifted it out carefully and set it on the desk.

"Should I open it?" Zeph reached toward the lid.

"No. I should open it." Cornelius nudged the boy's hand away with one wing. "If the contents prove legally dangerous, I prefer to maintain plausible deniability regarding your involvement."

"We are literally committing breaking and entering."

"We are conducting emergency investigation under temporal pressure during an active medical crisis." Cornelius opened the box. "The legal distinction will matter if we survive to participate in subsequent judicial proceedings."

The box contained three items.

First: A small leather journal with worn binding. Cornelius opened it to a random page and found Demos's handwriting—the same chaotic notation style from the medical ledger, but these entries appeared personal rather than professional. Journal entries about patients, ethical concerns, resource allocation dilemmas.

Second: A piece of jewelry—a silver chain with a small pendant carved in the shape of a stylized flower. The metalwork was delicate, expensive. Not something a junior healer would typically own on Temple salary.

Third: A sealed scroll tube made of brass with an official-looking wax seal.

Cornelius set the journal and necklace aside and picked up the scroll tube. The brass was cold against his claws. The seal showed the Temple's official mark—the same symbol used on verified birth records and other legal documents.

His scales prickled.

"What is it?" Zeph leaned closer.

"Potentially nothing. Potentially everything." Cornelius examined the seal carefully. Unbroken. Deliberately preserved. The tube itself showed slight tarnish consistent with being stored in a drawer for years rather than weeks.

He rotated it slowly, checking for any additional markings or notations. Nothing. Just the sealed tube and its official stamp.

"Are you going to open it?" Zeph's tone suggested he already knew the answer.

"Opening sealed official documents without authorization constitutes a separate category of legal violation." Cornelius continued holding the tube. "It transforms our current activity from emergency investigation to deliberate evidence tampering."

"But you are going to open it anyway."

"I am attempting to determine whether the potential knowledge value justifies the additional criminal liability." But even as Cornelius said it, he knew he would break the seal. Had to break the seal. Because Demos had locked this away deliberately. Had kept it separate from his other records. Had preserved it with the same care Cornelius applied to rare manuscripts.

Which meant it mattered.

Cornelius broke the seal.

The wax cracked with a sound that felt too loud in the quiet Archive. He pulled the end cap off the tube and extracted the scroll inside—parchment, official thickness, rolled tightly to fit the container.

He unrolled it carefully against the desk surface.

The document was a birth record. Official Temple format. All the proper sections filled out in neat administrative script.

Date of birth.

Location: Temple of Althaia, Private Birthing Room.

Attending healer: Sister Photine Kallistos.

Witness: Brother Demos (signed).

Infant designation: Female, Gorgon, Healthy.

Mother's name: Photine Kallistos.

Father's name: [Declined to State].

Infant name: Melaina.

Cornelius stopped breathing.

The Archive's silence pressed against his eardrums with physical weight. His claws remained precisely positioned holding the scroll edges. His eyes tracked across the text again, slower this time, confirming what he had already read.

Photine Kallistos.

Mother.

Melaina.

Daughter.

The words rearranged his entire understanding of the crisis with the same force as a manuscript revealing itself to contain completely different content than its catalog description suggested.

"What is it?" Zeph's voice came from very far away even though he stood directly beside the desk.

Cornelius could not immediately formulate words. His analytical processes were too occupied with recalculating every interaction, every decision, every desperate action through this new framework.

Photine was not simply a Temple healer treating a patient named Melaina.

She was a mother treating her daughter.

Demos was not simply a colleague covering for unauthorized medical procedures.

He was an uncle protecting his niece. A brother shielding his sister from legal and social consequences that would destroy not just her career but her life.

The sandalwood quarantine soap. The secret petrification procedures. The desperate attempts to halt Melaina's degenerative disease. The careful destruction of evidence. The planned flight on a smuggler ship.

Not criminal activity.

Maternal protection.

"Cornelius?" Zeph touched his wing. "You are doing the thing where you go completely still and it is unsettling."

"Photine is Melaina's mother." Cornelius heard his own voice as though from a distance. "This is an official birth record documenting the delivery seventeen years ago. Photine as attending healer and mother. Demos as witness."

Zeph leaned over the document. Read it. Read it again. Then looked up with an expression that suggested he was also recalculating everything.

"Oh," he said quietly. "Oh no."

"Yes."

"But—Gorgon births to high-status families—" Zeph's voice trailed off.

"Are illegal under civic law if the Gorgon heritage originates from the mother's bloodline rather than consensual partnership." Cornelius continued staring at the document. "The Three Families maintain strict genealogical requirements for inheritance and social standing. A Kallistos bearing a Gorgon child would represent catastrophic family scandal."

"So she hid it."

"She hid it." Cornelius thought of Photine's exhaustion. Her fear. Her obsessive focus on contamination and containment. "For seventeen years, she successfully concealed Melaina's existence. Raised her in secret, likely claiming she was a foundling or ward rather than biological daughter. And Demos knew. Helped. Covered for her throughout his entire time at the Temple."

The relationship between Demos and Photine recontextualized completely. Not simply senior healer and junior colleague. Not mentor and student. Family. Siblings, probably, or close cousins within the Kallistos bloodline who trusted each other enough to maintain this level of conspiracy.

"When Melaina developed the degenerative petrification disease," Cornelius continued, his analytical voice steady despite internal chaos, "Photine could not seek official Temple resources without revealing their relationship. Could not request specialized treatment protocols. Could not even acknowledge her own desperate motivation for saving this one specific patient."

"So she did it all secretly. The quarantine soap. The experimental procedures. The petrification preservation." Zeph's hands were shaking slightly. "She was trying to save her daughter and could not tell anyone why that patient mattered so much."

"And Demos supported her. Channeled Temple resources to help. Probably conducted his own research into treatment options." Cornelius thought of the medical ledger. The careful tracking of fever cases and progression patterns. "When Melaina's condition worsened beyond any known cure, Photine made the choice to petrify her—to lock her daughter into magical stasis rather than watch her die."

The tragedy of it assembled with terrible elegance.

Photine preserving Melaina in stone because that was the only form of preservation available.

Demos protecting both of them despite the professional and legal risks.

And when Demos himself contracted the same degenerative condition—probably from exposure during treatment procedures—Photine had likely attempted the same preservation transformation.

But something had gone wrong.

The petrification was incomplete. Unstable. Demos was dying inside stone while Melaina remained in perfect stasis.

"Why is this document here?" Zeph asked quietly. "Why did Demos keep it?"

Cornelius examined the scroll again. The parchment was expensive. The calligraphy was formal. The seal had been official Temple administration rather than simple healer notation.

"This should have been filed in the birth ledger we examined." Cornelius gestured toward the shelving units. "Official records are meant to be publicly accessible for genealogical verification and legal proceedings. But Demos witnessed this birth and immediately removed the documentation from official filing."

"To protect Photine."

"To protect the entire family. If this record existed in public archives, anyone conducting Kallistos genealogical research would discover Photine bore a Gorgon child. The scandal would destroy her standing, revoke her Temple position, and likely result in criminal prosecution under genealogical fraud statutes." Cornelius looked at the locked drawer. "Demos locked this away seventeen years ago and maintained the secret ever since."

The weight of that duration pressed against Cornelius's awareness. Seventeen years of careful deception. Of maintaining false records. Of ensuring that this one document never surfaced during routine archive access.

Seventeen years of Demos choosing his family over institutional procedure.

"What do we do with it?" Zeph's voice was barely audible. "If the Watch finds this during their investigation—"

"Captain Theo would be legally obligated to arrest Photine for genealogical fraud, unlawful birth concealment, and conspiracy to falsify Temple records." Cornelius carefully rolled the scroll closed. "The charges carry mandatory prosecution regardless of circumstances or motivation."

"She would be executed."

"The penalty for genealogical fraud at Photine's social status is exile or execution depending on judicial discretion and family political maneuvering." Cornelius held the scroll between his claws. "Given current political tensions regarding Gorgon rights and the Three Families' influence on civic governance, execution remains plausible."

They stood in silence. The Archive's dust-filled air pressed close. In the corner, Demos's statue maintained its frozen reach toward ledgers he would never file without reversal that depended entirely on Photine's survival and cooperation.

Cornelius looked at the document.

Looked at the covered statue.

Looked at the satchel containing six hundred gold crowns obtained by selling his most precious possession.

The equation was not complicated.

If he preserved this document and provided it to Watch authorities, Photine would be arrested and prosecuted. Demos would die without reversal. Melaina would remain stone permanently. And the legal system would congratulate itself for maintaining genealogical standards regardless of the cost in actual human lives.

If he destroyed the document, he eliminated the primary evidence of Photine's crime. The Watch could suspect. The families could gossip. But without official birth records, prosecution became legally fragile.

And Photine could potentially survive to reverse the petrifications and flee the city with her daughter.

Cornelius had spent one hundred and twenty-seven years preserving documents.

Protecting knowledge.

Cataloging truth.

He walked to the nearest oil lamp and turned up the wick until flame brightened against the glass.

"What are you doing?" Zeph's tone suggested he already knew.

"I am applying lessons learned from recent resource allocation decisions." Cornelius held the scroll over the lamp flame. "Sometimes preservation requires destroying evidence."

"That is an official Temple document. Burning it is—"

"Another crime to add to our expanding list of legal violations conducted in service of keeping people alive." Cornelius watched the parchment edge blacken. "I recently sold the Founder's annotated Chronicles to fund smuggler passage. Comparatively, document destruction feels like minor additional liability."

The flame caught the scroll's edge. Expensive parchment burned differently than cheap paper—slower, with less smoke, producing ash that maintained structural integrity longer before collapsing.

Cornelius held it steady and watched Photine Kallistos's name blacken and curl.

Watched Melaina's birth record reduce to carbon.

Watched seventeen years of dangerous truth transform into ash that could not testify in judicial proceedings.

The heat prickled against his claws but he maintained position until the entire scroll was consumed. Then he released the final fragments to fall into the lamp's catch-basin where they dissolved into anonymous residue.

"We just destroyed evidence in an active Watch investigation," Zeph said quietly.

"We destroyed documentation of a secret that would result in multiple executions and prevent medical reversal of petrification affecting three people." Cornelius closed the lamp's glass panel. "The moral mathematics seem straightforward."

"Theo will know something is missing. He inventoried Demos's desk contents. If there was a locked drawer and now it is empty—"

"Then he will suspect Demos maintained personal secrets and we removed them." Cornelius returned to the desk and picked up the leather journal and silver necklace. "Which is accurate. But suspicion without evidence cannot sustain prosecution."

He secured both items in his satchel alongside the gold crowns. The journal might contain additional dangerous information. The necklace appeared to be a gift—possibly from Photine to Demos or vice versa. Family connection items that would raise questions if discovered during Watch searches.

Better to remove them entirely.

Zeph watched him work. "You are getting very comfortable with crime."

"I am expanding my understanding of which rules deserve preservation and which rules deserve destruction." Cornelius closed the satchel and secured the straps. "Imelda suggested I was finally growing up. Apparently maturation involves recognizing that perfect record-keeping is less important than preventing preventable deaths."

"Demos sold his grave to buy medicine. You sold your hoard to buy passage. Now you are burning evidence to protect a family." Zeph's expression showed something that might have been pride. "You are learning."

"I am applying inconsistent ethical frameworks in response to immediate crisis pressure." But Cornelius felt the truth beneath his deflection. He was choosing. People over procedure. Lives over law. Messy human needs over clean institutional order.

And it felt correct in a way that made his previous century of rigid preservation seem hollow.

He moved toward the door. "We need to reach the harbor. Imelda will be coordinating with dock officials. The Constant Stanza will attempt departure regardless of whether we arrive in time."

Zeph followed. They climbed the stairs together—dragon and human adolescent, both carrying more secrets than their species and ages typically accumulated.

At the top of the stairs, Cornelius paused and looked back at the Archive entrance.

Somewhere below, Demos remained frozen. Dying slowly. Unaware that his final secret was now ash and that his survival depended on three criminals conducting increasingly desperate rescue operations.

"We will save him," Zeph said quietly.

"We will try." Cornelius spread his wings. "Which is apparently the lesson everyone has been attempting to teach me. Trying matters even when success is not guaranteed."

They exited into the Temple courtyard. The afternoon bells marked the hour—four chimes indicating they had approximately twelve minutes before fifth bell and the Constant Stanza's scheduled departure.

Twelve minutes to reach the harbor.

Locate a smuggler ship in a district full of vessels.

Find Photine before she was arrested or abandoned.

Convince her to reverse three separate petrifications.

And do it all while carrying six hundred gold crowns, one dead healer's journal, one incriminating necklace, and the knowledge that they had just destroyed evidence that might have saved them if everything went wrong.

The equation was not favorable.

But Cornelius launched himself toward the harbor anyway.

Behind him, Zeph ran to catch up.

The game was not finished.

And they had already spent too much to quit now.

# Chapter 16

# Chapter 16

The docks smelled like everything Cornelius had spent one hundred and twenty-seven years avoiding.

Brine. Tar. Fish guts decomposing in inadequate drainage systems. Unwashed sailors. Barrel wood that had absorbed decades of questionable cargo. The entire harbor district assaulted his senses with chaotic intensity that made his scales itch with the need to flee back to climate-controlled archive storage.

He landed on a relatively clean section of planking and immediately regretted the decision. The wood was slick with substances he preferred not to identify. His claws found purchase but the texture was wrong—too smooth, too organic, distinctly biological in a way that suggested recent contact with marine life.

"Where do we even start?" Zeph arrived breathing hard, having run the distance from the Temple while Cornelius flew. The boy looked around at the chaos of docked vessels with an expression that mirrored Cornelius's internal dismay. "There are like fifty ships here."

"Forty-three currently visible from this vantage point." Cornelius adjusted his spectacles and surveyed the harbor. "However, most are commercial cargo vessels or passenger ships with official registry. The Constant Stanza operates without manifest documentation, which limits probable docking locations to areas with minimal Watch oversight."

"So the sketchy part of the sketchy docks."

"Imprecise but functionally accurate." Cornelius moved along the planking, avoiding puddles of unknown origin. "Smuggler vessels prefer berths with easy harbor access but poor sight lines from Watch stations. Typically the farthest piers from central administration."

They moved deeper into the dock district. The organized chaos of legitimate commerce gave way to seedier operations—vessels with deliberately obscured names, captains conducting quiet conversations with hooded figures, cargo transfers happening with conspicuous lack of documentation.

Cornelius's analytical mind cataloged details despite his physical discomfort. The harbor followed predictable patterns. Legal ships clustered near customs inspection. Questionable operations spread toward the periphery where oversight thinned and officials could be convinced to look elsewhere for modest financial considerations.

"That one." Zeph pointed toward a mid-sized vessel docked at the end of a sagging pier. "The name is covered but I can see part of what looks like fancy painted letters underneath the tarp."

Cornelius looked. The ship showed signs of deliberate anonymity—covered nameplate, minimal deck activity, crew members who carried themselves with the particular alertness of people conducting illegal business. But underneath the concealment measures, the vessel's construction suggested quality. Expensive wood. Professional maintenance. The result of successful smuggling operations rather than desperate criminal enterprise.

"Approach carefully," Cornelius said. "Do not indicate official investigation or Watch affiliation. We are potential customers seeking passage information."

They moved along the pier. The planking here was even worse—rotted sections patched with mismatched wood, gaps showing water below, the entire structure swaying with each wave. Cornelius spread his wings for balance and tried not to calculate the probability of structural failure.

A sailor emerged from below deck as they approached. Human. Female. Approximately forty years old with the weathered skin and careful eyes of someone who had survived decades of illegal maritime commerce.

"We are not taking passengers," she said before Cornelius could speak. "Private charter. Fully booked."

"I am not seeking passage." Cornelius kept his tone professionally neutral. "I am attempting to locate a specific vessel. The Constant Stanza. I have urgent business with individuals who arranged transport aboard that ship."

The sailor's expression did not change but her posture shifted fractionally—the subtle adjustment that indicated Cornelius had said something significant.

"You got names?" she asked.

"Sister Photine Kallistos. Possibly traveling with five additional passengers. Departure scheduled for fifth bell today." Cornelius watched her face carefully. "I am not Watch affiliated. I am not attempting to interfere with your business operations. I simply need to communicate with Photine before departure."

The sailor studied him for a long moment. Then looked at Zeph. Then back at Cornelius.

"You are the dragon from the library," she said finally. "The one who helped with that business last year when the merchant guild tried to claim historical precedent for reduced dock fees."

Cornelius did not remember that specific incident but his archive included extensive documentation of civic disputes involving historical record interpretation. Very likely he had provided reference materials to someone at some point during those proceedings.

"I maintain historical records that occasionally prove relevant to modern legal disputes," he said carefully.

"You saved those dock workers from getting fired when the guild wanted to cut labor costs using some old contract nobody could read anymore." The sailor's expression softened fractionally. "My brother works those docks. He says you are decent for bureaucratic dragon types."

"I am gratified that my professional services were appreciated." Cornelius filed that interaction away as an example of long-term reputation benefits from competent archival work. "Does that mean you will confirm whether this vessel is in fact the Constant Stanza?"

The sailor gestured toward the covered nameplate. "This is the Stanza. Your people are not here yet. Quartermaster is below if you want to discuss their passage arrangements. But make it quick. We sail at sunset whether they show or not."

"Understood. Thank you for your cooperation."

Cornelius moved toward the gangplank—a narrow board connecting pier to deck that swayed with disturbing flexibility. He paused. Calculated weight distribution. Determined that dragon anatomy did not favor single-plank crossings over water.

"I hate boats," he muttered.

"You can fly," Zeph pointed out.

"I am aware of my capabilities. That does not reduce my distaste for nautical architecture." But Cornelius spread his wings for balance and walked the gangplank with as much dignity as a dragon could muster while wobbling on wet wood.

The deck showed evidence of professional smuggling operations—concealed compartments for cargo, rigging designed for speed rather than capacity, minimal visible armament but plenty of subtle defensive positioning. A ship built to run rather than fight but capable of both when necessary.

Below deck was darker and significantly more cramped. Cornelius descended carefully, his claws finding inadequate purchase on steep stairs designed for human feet. The air was thick with the smell of wood preservative and old cargo residue.

A woman sat at a small desk wedged into what had probably been designed as storage space. She looked up as Cornelius entered, showed no surprise at a dragon's appearance, and returned her attention to the ledger open before her.

"Quartermaster?" Cornelius asked.

"That would be me. If you are here about the medical supplies run to the southern ports, we are still negotiating rates with the Temple procurement office."

"I am here regarding the six passengers scheduled for departure today. The party associated with Sister Photine Kallistos."

The quartermaster flipped backward through her ledger. Found the relevant page. Examined it with the particular focus of someone who managed complex illegal logistics.

"What about them?" she asked without looking up.

"I need to know their current status. Whether they have arrived, whether passage has been finalized, whether—"

"Payment is pending," the quartermaster interrupted. "Passage was arranged through an intermediary a week ago. Deposit covered administrative fees and berth reservations. Final payment for six passengers is due at departure. If they show up with the gold, they sail. If not, berths get sold to next available customers."

Cornelius's scales stopped prickling and went absolutely still. "Payment is pending?"

"That is what I said."

"How much payment is pending?"

The quartermaster consulted her ledger. "Three thousand nine hundred crowns for six passengers with minimal luggage, priority berth assignments, and discretionary documentation. Half now, half on arrival as per standard terms for this route."

Cornelius did rapid calculations. Photine had burned documents referencing the Constant Stanza in her dormitory hearth. She had cleared her room of all possessions. She had arranged for her own passage plus five others—presumably Mother Ligeia and key Enclave leadership.

But she had not paid.

Which meant all those careful preparations, all that systematic evidence destruction, all that desperate planning was predicated on securing approximately two thousand crowns before departure.

Two thousand crowns that Photine did not possess.

Temple healers earned professional salaries but not fortunes. Photine had spent years channeling resources to Melaina's secret treatment. She had purchased expensive quarantine supplies. She had maintained two separate lives—public healer and private mother—with all the financial strain that deception required.

Cornelius had six hundred crowns in his satchel right now. Enough to make a significant contribution toward passage cost but not enough to cover the full amount.

And Photine did not know he had sold his hoard. Did not know he was carrying gold specifically to help fund her escape. Did not know that anyone except Mother Ligeia might be willing to provide financial assistance.

She thought she had to acquire two thousand crowns entirely through her own resources.

But she had no resources left.

"Thank you for the information," Cornelius said quietly. "We will return shortly."

He climbed back up the steep stairs, his mind assembling implications with increasing alarm. On deck, he moved to the rail and looked out at the harbor. The sun was lower now. Perhaps ninety minutes before sunset. Perhaps ninety minutes before the Constant Stanza departed with or without its scheduled passengers.

Zeph joined him at the rail. "What did you find out?"

"Photine has not paid for the passage. Payment is pending until departure."

"But she arranged it a week ago. She had time to—" Zeph stopped. "Oh. She does not have the money."

"No. She does not have the money." Cornelius watched a cargo vessel maneuver toward deeper water. "She arranged passage when she believed she had access to funds. Mother Ligeia presumably organized financial contributions from Enclave members for the other five passengers. But Photine's personal share remains unpaid."

"So she can't leave. She'll be stuck here when the ship sails."

"Unless she acquires two thousand crowns in the next ninety minutes." Cornelius turned that problem over in his analytical mind. Two thousand crowns. Photine's current resources were minimal. Her possessions sold or abandoned. Her Temple salary insufficient for that amount. Her family connections unavailable due to the need for secrecy.

Where would a desperate healer with no money and no time acquire two thousand crowns?

The answer assembled with terrible clarity.

"The Temple Vault," Cornelius said.

Zeph looked confused. "What about it?"

"The Temple maintains emergency medical funds in a secured vault. Gold reserves for purchasing supplies during sudden need—epidemic response, mass casualty events, natural disasters requiring immediate intervention." Cornelius's claws gripped the rail. "Photine has vault access as senior healer. She has authorization to withdraw funds for legitimate medical emergencies."

"But this is not an emergency. This is her running away."

"She does not view it as running away. She views it as preserving her daughter's life through the only means available." Cornelius thought of the birth record he had burned. The careful evidence destruction in Photine's dormitory. The systematic planning evident in every action. "And she knows the vault contains sufficient funds because she participated in recent inventory documentation following the resource crisis."

Comprehension spread across Zeph's expression. "You think she is going to rob the Temple."

"I think she is going to withdraw emergency funds under false pretenses and flee before the theft is discovered." Cornelius released the rail and turned toward the gangplank. "The vault would have been recently restocked following our book donations. Possibly ten thousand crowns or more depending on ongoing procurement needs. More than sufficient for passage costs."

"But that is Temple money. Medical supplies funding. If she steals it—"

"The Temple will survive temporarily reduced reserves. But Photine's calculation is not about long-term institutional impact. Her calculation is about her daughter's survival measured against professional ethics and legal constraints." Cornelius moved toward the pier. "She has already petrified three people, destroyed official records, and planned elaborate escape procedures. Vault robbery represents a comparatively minor additional crime."

They reached the pier and Cornelius paused, his analytical mind running through logistics. The Temple Vault was three districts away. Photine would need to access it during normal administrative hours to avoid suspicion. Withdrawal documentation would need to appear legitimate until after departure when investigation revealed the fraud.

Current time was approximately thirty minutes past the previous hour. Sunset in ninety minutes. The vault closed at final bell—roughly one hour from now.

Photine would strike soon. Possibly within the next twenty or thirty minutes.

"We need to return to the Temple immediately," Cornelius said.

"To stop her?"

"No. To ensure she succeeds without getting caught." Cornelius spread his wings and prepared for flight. "If she is arrested during the robbery attempt, she cannot reverse the petrifications. Demos dies. Melaina remains stone permanently. And Photine faces execution for theft in addition to all her other crimes."

"But if she robs the vault and escapes, the Temple loses money it needs for patients."

"I am aware of the moral complications." Cornelius's scales prickled with discomfort at his own reasoning. "However, the Temple can replace stolen funds through additional fundraising. We cannot replace Demos or reverse Melaina's condition or secure Photine's cooperation if she is in Watch custody."

Zeph looked torn between agreement and distress. "We are helping a thief rob a medical charity."

"We are preventing a desperate mother from being arrested while attempting to fund her daughter's escape from execution." Cornelius crouched. "Get on my back. We do not have time for you to run the distance."

Zeph climbed up without further argument. His weight settled between Cornelius's wings with familiar pressure. Cornelius adjusted his balance and launched himself upward with enough force to clear the docked ships.

The harbor district spread below. Vessels clustered around piers. Cargo operations proceeded with organized chaos. People moved through maritime commerce completely unaware that three districts away, a healer was probably preparing to commit robbery.

Cornelius angled toward the Temple and increased his speed. Wind pressure made his spectacles slide slightly. He adjusted them with one claw while maintaining flight trajectory through practiced coordination.

"How do we help without getting caught ourselves?" Zeph's voice carried over the wind. "If she sees us, she will know we know."

"We do not interfere directly. We observe. We ensure Watch presence does not interfere. We provide distraction if necessary." Cornelius flew over the commercial district. "And if she succeeds, we follow her back to the docks and provide the additional six hundred crowns I obtained from selling the Chronicles."

"That covers the full payment."

"Yes. She acquires two thousand from the vault. I contribute six hundred from my liquidated hoard. Total available funds equal two thousand six hundred crowns—sufficient for passenger costs plus modest bribes or emergency expenses." Cornelius descended toward the Temple district. "She escapes. Reverses the petrifications before departure. Sails with her daughter toward a city without genealogical persecution. Everyone survives."

"Except the Temple is missing two thousand crowns."

"The Temple will survive. Institutions possess resilience that individual people lack." But Cornelius felt the weight of that calculation. Two thousand crowns represented significant medical purchasing power. Bandages. Medicines. Supplies that would treat patients who could not afford private healers.

He was choosing Photine over those unknown future patients.

The equation felt uncomfortably similar to triage decisions he had criticized earlier. Who deserved saving more—one woman and her daughter, or dozens of poor patients who depended on Temple charity?

Except that framing was inaccurate. Saving Photine also saved Demos. And Demos had sold his own grave to fund charity medicine for exactly those vulnerable patients.

If Cornelius allowed Photine to be arrested, he was effectively choosing to let Demos die. And Demos's death would represent the loss of a healer who had spent himself completely trying to help the people the Temple excluded.

The moral mathematics balanced differently depending on how many variables were included.

Cornelius pushed the calculation aside and focused on immediate logistics. The Temple's administrative wing appeared ahead—stone architecture, organized courtyards, the vault entrance accessible through the eastern corridor.

He landed in a service courtyard away from main traffic and allowed Zeph to dismount.

"The vault is two corridors east," Cornelius said quietly. "Photine will likely already be inside completing withdrawal documentation. We need to position ourselves where we can observe without being noticed."

"You are a dragon. You get noticed."

"I am a Library Dragon with legitimate professional relationship to Temple operations. My presence near administrative areas is not inherently suspicious." Cornelius moved toward the eastern corridor. "You, however, should remain out of sight. Adolescent humans loitering near vault access during withdrawal procedures would attract attention."

Zeph looked annoyed but did not argue. He moved to a shadowed alcove with sight lines to the corridor entrance.

Cornelius proceeded with careful steps, his claws clicking against stone floors. The Temple's interior felt wrong. Too quiet. Less activity than normal administrative hours should produce. But of course—many staff members had departed early due to the ongoing crisis. Reduced personnel coverage would make vault access easier for someone with authorization.

He reached the junction point where the eastern corridor branched toward vault access. Paused. Listened.

Voices carried from deeper in the corridor. Female voice. Professional tone. Discussing withdrawal documentation and emergency authorization codes.

Photine.

Cornelius moved closer but kept himself positioned around the corner where he could hear but not be directly visible. His senses strained to interpret the conversation.

"—completely legitimate emergency requisition signed by the senior healer on duty." Photine's voice had the particular controlled quality that indicated someone performing rather than speaking naturally. "Medical supplies procurement for quarantine supplies following exposure protocol activation."

"I am not questioning your authorization." A different voice—probably the vault administrator. "I am simply noting that we had recent large-scale donations that just restocked these reserves. Withdrawing two thousand crowns this quickly seems unusual."

"The exposure risk is unusual. I cannot provide specific patient details due to privacy protocols but the situation requires immediate supply acquisition." A pause. "Do you need me to escalate this to higher authority? Because the time delay could compromise containment."

"No. No, that is not necessary. Your authorization is valid." Sounds of movement. Keys. A heavy door opening. "Two thousand in standard crowns? This will take a few minutes to count."

"I will wait."

Cornelius silently moved fractionally closer. His analytical mind cataloged details. Photine was using exposure protocol as justification—implying infectious disease risk that would make questioning dangerous. The vault administrator was uncomfortable but not suspicious enough to refuse a senior healer's legitimate authorization.

The robbery was proceeding successfully.

Footsteps approached from behind Cornelius. He turned sharply and saw Zeph emerging from his hiding position with urgent expression.

"Watch patrol," Zeph whispered. "Coming through the main corridor. Two guards. They are going to pass right by the vault entrance."

Cornelius's mind calculated implications instantly. Watch presence near the vault during suspicious withdrawal would potentially trigger questions. Questions would create delays. Delays would make Photine miss her departure window.

They needed a distraction.

Something that would redirect Watch attention away from the vault corridor without creating enough disturbance to attract additional security response.

"Go to the main courtyard," Cornelius said quietly. "Start yelling about a medical emergency at the charity clinic entrance. Claim someone collapsed requiring immediate healer response. When the guards investigate, maintain the performance until Photine completes the withdrawal and departs."

"What if they realize I am lying?"

"Then apologize and claim you were mistaken but genuinely concerned. Fear of disciplinary action is less important than preventing Photine's arrest." Cornelius nudged him toward the courtyard. "Go. Now. Before they reach this corridor."

Zeph ran.

Cornelius repositioned himself where he could observe the vault corridor while also monitoring the Watch patrol's approach. Heavy footsteps. Professional conversation about patrol routes and shift schedules. Getting closer.

Then, from the direction of the main courtyard, Zeph's voice rang out with impressive panic. "Help! Someone help! There is a man collapsed by the clinic entrance! He is not breathing! We need a healer!"

The footsteps stopped. Brief consultation between the guards. Then rapid movement toward the courtyard and away from the vault corridor.

Cornelius allowed himself a moment of satisfaction. Zeph had good instincts for crisis improvisation.

The vault door opened again. Photine emerged with a leather satchel that hung heavily against her side. Her expression was composed but her hands shook slightly as she closed the door behind her.

She moved quickly down the corridor without noticing Cornelius in his shadowed position.

He waited until she had turned the far corner. Then he followed at careful distance, maintaining enough separation to avoid detection while keeping her in audible range.

Photine moved through the Temple's corridors with the confidence of someone who belonged there. No hesitation. No suspicious behavior. Just a senior healer conducting normal administrative business.

She exited through the eastern service entrance—the same entrance Cornelius had used earlier—and emerged into the courtyard beyond.

Cornelius watched from the doorway as she crossed the courtyard and disappeared into the street network leading toward the harbor.

She had succeeded.

Two thousand crowns in her satchel.

Approximately seventy-five minutes until sunset.

Enough time to reach the docks, board the Constant Stanza, and depart before theft discovery.

Cornelius turned back toward the main courtyard where Zeph would be maintaining his medical emergency performance. He needed to extract the boy before Watch guards realized the emergency was fabricated.

But as he moved through the corridor, a thought occurred to him.

Photine had the money now. She would pay for passage. Board the ship. Sail at sunset.

But she still needed to reverse the petrifications.

And Demos was at the library. Melaina was at the library. Both in stone. Both requiring Photine's specific magical intervention to restore.

She could not board the ship without reversing them first.

Which meant she would return to the library after securing passage.

Which meant Cornelius needed to be there when she arrived.

He increased his pace and located Zeph in the main courtyard explaining apologetically to two Watch guards that the collapsed man had apparently recovered and departed before healers arrived.

"Very sorry for the false alarm," Zeph was saying. "I really thought he was dying but maybe he was just drunk? Or sleeping? I am not good at medical assessment."

The guards looked annoyed but not suspicious. One of them waved Zeph away with the particular dismissiveness applied to adolescent overreaction.

Cornelius intercepted the boy as he retreated. "We need to return to the library. Photine will reverse the petrifications before boarding the ship."

"How do you know?"

"Because she cannot sail with her daughter still in stone." Cornelius moved toward the courtyard exit. "She acquired the money. She will secure passage. Then she will return to extract Melaina from my archive and reverse all three transformations before final departure."

They emerged into the street. The sun was lower now. Shadows lengthening. The particular quality of late afternoon light that indicated sunset approached.

Cornelius spread his wings. "Hold on tightly. I am going to fly at unsafe velocity."

Zeph climbed onto his back without complaint.

Cornelius launched himself upward and angled toward the library with enough acceleration that his passenger made a small sound of alarm.

The city blurred below. Stone buildings. Civic architecture. People conducting normal end-of-day activities completely unaware of the crisis playing out above them.

Photine had money now.

She had passage.

She had approximately one hour before departure.

She would come to the library. Would reverse the petrifications. Would extract her daughter and flee toward the docks.

And Cornelius would give her six hundred additional crowns to ensure she had sufficient resources for emergency contingencies during escape.

The library appeared ahead—familiar architecture, organized courtyards, the roost where he had spent decades believing preservation meant hoarding rather than strategic deployment.

He landed hard and allowed Zeph to dismount.

"What now?" the boy asked.

"Now we wait," Cornelius said. "She will arrive soon. And when she does, we will help her save everyone and escape before the Watch realizes what has happened."

The sun continued its descent toward the horizon.

Time continued running out.

But at least now the equation balanced.

Photine had resources. Cornelius had resources. Combined, they possessed enough to save Demos, restore Melaina, and fund an escape that might actually succeed.

Sometimes preservation required theft.

Sometimes it required selling your hoard.

Sometimes it required standing aside and allowing desperate people to commit crimes in service of keeping their families alive.

Cornelius settled near the library entrance and watched the street.

Waiting.

The game was almost finished.

Just one more move to make.

# Chapter 17

# Chapter 17

The Temple of Althaia's administrative wing was quieter than Cornelius had ever heard it.

No footsteps in distant corridors. No murmured conversations between clerks managing inventory ledgers. No scratch of quills documenting the endless bureaucratic details required to maintain a civic medical institution. Just silence, thick and waiting, filling spaces that normally hummed with professional activity.

Cornelius moved through the eastern hallway with deliberate care, each claw placed precisely to minimize sound against stone floors worn smooth by decades of foot traffic. The satchel hung against his side with weight that felt fundamentally incorrect—three hundred gold crowns in physical currency plus Lord Vane's letter of credit that could be immediately converted to an additional three hundred through Marcus Varen's professional network.

Six hundred crowns total.

The money represented the complete liquidation of his most treasured possession—the Founder's annotated first edition of *The Chronicles of the Founding*—transformed from bound parchment with historical significance into metal that existed only to facilitate exchange.

The conversion still felt wrong. Books had intrinsic weight distributed through carefully preserved pages. Gold just sat there being expensive and heavy and devoid of intellectual content.

Cornelius pushed the discomfort aside and focused on immediate logistics. Behind him, Zeph followed with the particular quiet that suggested the boy was finally learning proper archive-appropriate movement protocols.

"The Vault is ahead," Cornelius said softly. "Two more corridors and then the secured chamber."

"Is it actually locked or just ceremonially locked?" Zeph's whisper carried the practical skepticism of someone who had recently participated in multiple illegal entry operations.

"The Vault maintains genuine security protocols including reinforced door mechanisms and restricted key access." Cornelius turned the corner into the next corridor. "However, I possess override authorization through my role documenting Temple historical records. The administrative staff granted me access keys years ago for research purposes."

"So you can legally enter the Vault."

"I can legally enter for legitimate archival documentation purposes. I cannot legally enter to plant illicit funds intended to facilitate a senior healer's fraudulent emergency withdrawal and subsequent escape from prosecution." Cornelius extracted the key from his satchel. "The distinction matters conceptually even if the practical security measures remain identical."

They reached the Vault corridor. The passage was narrow—designed to funnel traffic toward a single controlled access point. The walls showed the same clinical whitewashed stone as the rest of the Temple's administrative wing. No decoration. No architectural flourish. Just functional surfaces optimized for cleaning and observation.

The Vault door was heavy iron reinforced with aged bronze—expensive materials indicating the historical value of what lay beyond. A substantial lock mechanism controlled access. Cornelius inserted his key and felt the internal components shift with well-maintained precision.

The lock clicked open.

He paused, listening. No footsteps. No voices. The entire wing remained empty just as he had observed during Photine's earlier withdrawal. Staff had departed early due to ongoing crisis management. Only essential personnel remained, and those were concentrated in the clinic wings rather than administrative offices.

Cornelius pushed the door inward.

The Vault's interior smelled of metal and dust in equal measure. The space was smaller than he expected—perhaps fifteen feet square with high ceilings that created the impression of a vertical shaft rather than a proper room. Whitewashed stone walls. A single central pedestal made of carved marble. Shelving units along the back wall holding locked boxes and sealed containers.

And dust. Everywhere. Thick enough to show recent disturbance patterns where Photine had conducted her earlier withdrawal.

Cornelius examined the pedestal. The marble showed age—small chips along the base, discoloration where metal containers had rested for extended periods, a general patina that spoke to decades of functional use rather than ceremonial significance.

This was where the Temple stored emergency medical reserves. Gold that could be rapidly converted to medicines during epidemic response. Bandages during mass casualty events. Specialized supplies when normal procurement channels proved inadequate.

Demos had probably stood here dozens of times, documenting inventory levels and managing allocation during his administrative duties.

And now the pedestal was empty except for dust outlines showing where locked boxes had recently sat before Photine removed them during her fraudulent quarantine withdrawal.

Cornelius lifted his satchel and placed it carefully on the marble surface.

The weight settled with a soft sound that echoed in the confined space. Three hundred gold crowns. Physical currency that Photine could immediately use to pay the Constant Stanza's quartermaster.

He stepped back and looked at the satchel.

It sat there being functional and expensive and completely inadequate to address the systematic resource failures that had created this entire crisis.

"That is it?" Zeph's voice pulled Cornelius from his analytical spiral. "We just leave the money and go?"

"We leave the money where Photine can access it during her planned withdrawal. When she arrives claiming emergency medical need, she will find exactly the funds required to pay her passage." Cornelius adjusted his spectacles. "From her perspective, she will believe she successfully acquired Temple emergency reserves through fraudulent authorization. From objective reality, she will be taking my liquidated hoard."

"So you are letting her think she is committing robbery when actually you are making a donation."

"I am ensuring she obtains necessary funds without the Temple suffering actual financial loss." Cornelius moved toward the door. "The distinction is ethically significant even if Photine never learns the truth."

"But the Temple will still investigate the missing money when they discover the withdrawal."

"They will investigate a withdrawal authorized by a senior healer using legitimate emergency protocols. They will find properly documented paperwork claiming quarantine supply procurement. They will eventually determine the emergency was fabricated and the funds were redirected toward illegal purposes." Cornelius paused at the doorway. "But by then Photine will have sailed beyond their jurisdiction and I will quietly replace the missing reserves through additional book donations before discrepancy investigation concludes."

Zeph was silent for a moment, processing implications. "You have thought this through."

"I have been forced to develop concerning facility with criminal logistics over the past three days." Cornelius stepped into the corridor and pulled the door partially closed. "Come. We need to position ourselves where we can observe without being detected."

They moved to a shadowed alcove approximately thirty feet from the Vault entrance—close enough to monitor activity but far enough to maintain concealment behind a stone pillar that supported the corridor's vaulted ceiling.

The alcove smelled of old paper and architectural dust. Cornelius settled into a position that allowed surveillance through the gap between pillar and wall. Zeph crouched beside him, the boy's shorter stature proving advantageous for hiding in confined spaces.

"How long until she arrives?" Zeph whispered.

"Unknown. She needs to complete standard administrative procedures to avoid suspicion—file paperwork, obtain authorization codes, present legitimate-appearing justification for emergency withdrawal." Cornelius watched the empty corridor. "Estimated timeline suggests fifteen to thirty minutes based on current hour and typical Vault access protocols."

"So we wait."

"Yes. We wait."

Silence settled around them. Cornelius's analytical mind automatically began cataloging environmental details. The corridor's acoustic properties amplified small sounds while dampening others based on architectural geometry. The whitewashed walls reflected ambient light from wall-mounted oil lamps in ways that created alternating zones of visibility and shadow. Temperature was optimal for document preservation—cool but not cold, dry but not desiccated.

The Temple's builders had understood environmental control even if their spiritual philosophy was questionable.

Time passed with the particular slow quality that characterized waiting. Cornelius tracked each minute by the faint bells marking quarter-hours in the civic tower. Each chime reminded him that sunset approached. That the Constant Stanza would sail regardless of passenger arrival. That Demos remained frozen in stone with biological functions degrading toward permanent death.

The weight of the burned birth record pressed against his awareness. He had destroyed official documentation. Had eliminated evidence of Melaina's parentage. Had chosen preservation of people over preservation of historical truth.

The decision should have felt worse. Should have generated the same internal protest that arose whenever he encountered damaged manuscripts or improperly filed records.

Instead it felt correct in a way that suggested his fundamental understanding of preservation had shifted.

Beside him, Zeph shifted position carefully. The boy's breathing was quiet but not silent—the organic rhythms of living creatures occupying space.

Cornelius realized with some surprise that he had become accustomed to Zeph's presence. The adolescent's tendency toward casual speech and emotional directness no longer registered as jarring. Instead it provided useful counterbalance to Cornelius's own analytical detachment.

When had that transition occurred?

Probably around the same time he began committing crimes to protect people rather than simply documenting their misfortunes.

Footsteps echoed in a distant corridor.

Cornelius went absolutely still, his entire body locked into frozen attention. Beside him, Zeph stopped breathing.

The footsteps approached. Not hurried. Not casual. The measured pace of someone moving with purpose while maintaining appearance of normal activity.

A figure emerged into the corridor—hooded, wearing healer's robes, carrying herself with the particular exhausted determination that characterized Photine's recent movement patterns.

She paused at the Vault door and glanced both directions along the corridor. The hood concealed her face but Cornelius recognized the gesture—checking for observation, confirming privacy, preparing for action that required secrecy.

She extracted a key from her robes. Inserted it into the lock mechanism. The same heavy click that Cornelius had produced earlier.

The door swung inward.

Photine entered the Vault and closed the door behind her.

Cornelius remained motionless in the alcove. His enhanced hearing tracked sounds through the heavy door with reasonable clarity. Footsteps against stone. A sharp intake of breath. Movement toward the central pedestal.

Then silence.

Extended silence that stretched long enough to become concerning.

Finally, very quietly, the sound of something heavy being lifted. Fabric rustling. The distinctive clink of metal currency shifting inside a container.

She had found the satchel.

Cornelius imagined the scene beyond the door. Photine standing at the pedestal. Staring at three hundred gold crowns that should not exist in an empty Vault. Processing the logistics of how emergency reserves she expected to fraudulently withdraw were already sitting waiting for her.

Would she recognize whose money this was?

Probably not. She had no way of knowing Cornelius had liquidated his hoard. No awareness that he understood her desperate financial situation. No reason to suspect that a Library Dragon would plant funds to facilitate her escape.

From her perspective, this was simply fortunate timing. The Temple's emergency reserves, recently restocked, providing exactly what she needed exactly when she needed it.

The door opened again.

Photine emerged carrying the satchel with both hands. The weight pulled at her shoulders—three hundred crowns was substantial currency to transport. She moved quickly now, abandoning the measured pace for genuine haste.

She did not look toward the alcove where Cornelius and Zeph remained hidden.

She simply walked down the corridor, turned at the junction, and disappeared from view.

Her footsteps faded into silence.

Cornelius released a breath he had not realized he was holding. Beside him, Zeph slowly straightened from his crouch.

"She took it," Zeph whispered.

"Yes. She took it." Cornelius remained watching the empty corridor. "She now possesses sufficient funds to pay the Constant Stanza's quartermaster, with modest remainder for emergency expenses during escape."

"Do we follow her?"

"No. We allow her to proceed with her planned departure sequence. She will secure passage. Then return to the library to reverse the petrifications before final boarding." Cornelius stepped out of the alcove. "We should position ourselves at the library before she arrives."

They moved back through the administrative wing corridors. The Temple remained quiet around them—a massive civic institution operating in crisis mode with minimal staffing and maximum systemic strain.

Cornelius thought of Demos selling his burial plot to fund medicine for patients the Temple had abandoned. Thought of the systematic resource failures that had forced a healer to choose between institutional rules and actual human lives. Thought of genealogical laws that made it illegal for Photine to acknowledge her own daughter.

The civilization that had built this beautiful whitewashed architecture with optimal environmental controls had also constructed social systems that destroyed families for arbitrary genealogical standards.

The equation did not balance.

They exited into the courtyard. The afternoon light had shifted toward the particular golden quality that preceded sunset. Shadows lengthened. The air cooled fractionally.

Cornelius spread his wings and prepared for flight. "We need to return to the library immediately. When Photine arrives to reverse the petrifications, I will provide the additional three hundred crowns from Lord Vane's letter of credit. Combined with what she just acquired, she will have sufficient resources for complete passage payment plus contingency funds."

"And then she escapes and Demos gets saved and Melaina goes free and everyone lives." Zeph climbed onto Cornelius's back. "That is the plan."

"That is the plan assuming no additional complications arise during the remaining ninety minutes before departure." Cornelius crouched. "Given our recent pattern of cascading disasters, I am not assuming anything."

He launched himself upward with enough force to clear the Temple's outer walls. The city spread below—stone buildings, organized streets, civic architecture that had stood for centuries.

Somewhere in that urban landscape, Photine was moving toward the harbor with three hundred gold crowns she believed she had stolen.

Somewhere in the Archives, Demos remained frozen in unstable stone with perhaps hours before permanent death.

Somewhere in Cornelius's hidden archive, Melaina waited in perfect stasis—a daughter her mother had protected for seventeen years through systematic deception and increasingly desperate measures.

And somewhere in Cornelius's understanding of his own purpose, something fundamental had shifted.

He had spent one hundred and twenty-seven years believing preservation meant protecting objects. Cataloging knowledge. Maintaining perfect environmental controls around bound parchment and historical artifacts.

But preservation was not about objects.

It was about choosing what mattered. About spending resources strategically rather than hoarding them indefinitely. About recognizing that perfect record-keeping meant nothing if the records documented preventable tragedies.

The library appeared ahead—familiar architecture, his roost visible atop the central dome, the organized repository of knowledge that had been his entire world for more than a century.

Now it was temporary safehouse for fugitives. Crime scene investigation site. Storage location for petrified patients. And apparently spontaneous headquarters for amateur criminal conspiracy.

Cornelius landed in the courtyard and allowed Zeph to dismount.

"What now?" the boy asked.

"Now we wait. Again." Cornelius moved toward the entrance. "Photine will arrive within the hour. She will reverse the petrifications. She will extract Melaina. And we will ensure she has everything necessary to succeed."

"And if something goes wrong?"

"Then we adapt. Improvise. Commit additional crimes as necessary to preserve the people who matter." Cornelius looked at Zeph. "I am told that is called growth."

Zeph smiled—genuine warmth rather than teenage sarcasm. "Imelda would be proud."

"Imelda would likely point out that maturation after only one hundred and twenty-seven years represents concerning delay in basic moral development." But Cornelius felt something that might have been satisfaction. "However, I suspect she would approve of the outcome even if she disapproved of the methodology."

They entered the library together.

The familiar scent of old paper and preserved knowledge surrounded Cornelius with immediate comfort. Books lined the walls. Organized shelves extended into careful rows. Everything maintained perfect environmental conditions and meticulous cataloging.

His hoard.

Except now it was smaller by one irreplaceable annotated first edition.

And that reduction felt more like proper allocation than loss.

Cornelius moved to his observation position near the main entrance where he could monitor arrivals while maintaining sight lines to the hidden archive access point.

The afternoon bells chimed.

Sunset approached.

The Constant Stanza would sail.

And Cornelius waited, watching the street, ready to provide whatever final assistance was required to save a family that should never have been forced into this desperate position.

Sometimes preservation required theft.

Sometimes it required burning evidence.

Sometimes it required standing in shadows watching a desperate mother take money she believed she was stealing but was actually receiving as anonymous charity from a dragon who had finally learned the difference between hoarding and helping.

The equation balanced now.

Or at least it balanced better than it had three days ago when Cornelius still believed perfect preservation meant never spending anything.

He settled into position and watched the street.

Waiting for Photine.

Waiting for the final moves in a game that should have ended with criminals being caught but would hopefully end with families being saved.

The sun continued its descent toward the horizon.

Time continued running out.

But at least now the pieces were positioned correctly.

At least now everyone had what they needed to survive.

At least now Cornelius understood what his hoard was actually for.

Not eternal preservation in perfect environmental conditions.

But strategic deployment when preservation of people mattered more than preservation of objects.

He watched the empty street and waited.

The game was almost finished.

Just one more player left to move.

# Chapter 18

# Chapter 18

Cornelius had spent one hundred and twenty-seven years developing professional patience, but waiting alone in the Temple Vault tested the limits of that acquired skill.

The space was too small for a dragon of even his modest proportions. The marble pedestal occupied the center, the satchel of gold resting on its surface with weight that pulled at Cornelius's awareness like an unresolved equation. Three hundred crowns. The exact physical mass of the Founder's annotated *Chronicles* before that priceless manuscript had been converted into currency.

He had sent Zeph back to the library fifteen minutes ago with instructions to prepare the hidden archive for rapid extraction procedures. Better to have the boy away from this confrontation. Better to limit the number of people who witnessed whatever was about to happen.

The Vault's whitewashed walls reflected lamplight with clinical brightness that hurt Cornelius's eyes after the comfortable dimness of his library. Everything here was designed for visibility and inventory control. No shadows. No concealment. No room for comfortable denial about what resources existed or how they were allocated.

The air smelled of metal and stone dust and, very faintly, sandalwood.

That last scent had become familiar over the past three days. The signature of Photine's preservation magic. The smell of quarantine soap and desperate medical intervention. The olfactory marker of a mother trying to save her daughter through increasingly criminal measures.

Cornelius positioned himself in the far corner where the shelving units met the wall. Not hiding exactly. Simply waiting with strategic positioning that would give him fractional advantage when Photine arrived.

His claws clicked against stone as he shifted weight. The sound echoed in the confined space—too loud, too obvious, fundamentally wrong for a dragon who preferred quiet archives to functional vaults.

Footsteps approached in the corridor beyond.

Cornelius went absolutely still. Every scale locked. Every muscle frozen. The particular immobility that dragons achieved when shifting from active observation to predatory focus.

The Vault door opened.

Photine entered quickly and closed the door behind her with the smooth efficiency of someone who had performed this action many times before. She wore the same hooded healer's robes from earlier. Her hands shook slightly as she turned toward the pedestal.

Then she stopped.

Her entire body went rigid with the specific tension that indicated someone processing information that contradicted expectations.

The pedestal was empty except for the leather satchel.

Cornelius watched her stare at the bare marble surface. Watched comprehension spread across features he could see now that lamplight illuminated beneath her hood. Watched her expression shift from professional determination to confusion to something that looked disturbingly like despair.

"No." Her voice cracked on the single word. "No, they cannot have—"

She moved to the shelving units. Pulled open locked boxes with keys that jangled from a ring at her belt. Each container proved empty. No gold reserves. No emergency funds. Nothing except dust and the ghost outlines of currency that had occupied these spaces before recent withdrawal.

Photine's breathing accelerated into something approaching panic. She opened another box. Another. Her movements became increasingly frantic as each search confirmed the same terrible conclusion.

The Temple's emergency medical reserves were gone.

"I checked the inventory three days ago." She was talking to herself now, the words spilling out with desperate logic. "Ten thousand in reserves. Recent donations. The book sale proceeds. It should be here. It has to be here."

She returned to the pedestal and stared at the leather satchel as though it might transform into something more useful through force of will alone.

Then, very slowly, she reached out and opened it.

Three hundred gold crowns gleamed in the lamplight.

Photine made a sound that was not quite a laugh and not quite a sob. Her hands hovered over the currency without touching it, as though the coins might vanish if she made contact.

"Three hundred." Her voice had gone flat. "I need two thousand and there are three hundred."

Cornelius chose that moment to speak.

"You need two thousand for the Constant Stanza's passage fees," he said quietly. "However, you already acquired that amount through your earlier fraudulent withdrawal. The three hundred currently available represents supplemental funding for emergency contingencies during escape."

Photine spun toward his voice with a speed that indicated excellent reflexes despite exhaustion. Her hood fell back, revealing a face that showed every day of her fifty-two years plus the accumulated damage of decades managing impossible medical triage.

Her eyes found him in the corner. Widened. Then narrowed with the particular focus that preceded Gorgon petrification magic.

Cornelius felt the pressure of her attention like physical weight against his scales. The air between them thickened with gathering power. Her gaze locked onto his with intensity that made his survival instincts scream for immediate evasive action.

He remained absolutely motionless.

"Sister Photine." He kept his tone professionally neutral despite the magical pressure building in the space between them. "I am not here to interfere with your escape. I am here to ensure you complete necessary medical interventions before departure."

"How long have you been following me?" Her voice was steady but her hands had curled into fists. The petrification magic continued gathering—Cornelius could feel it now, a sensation like cold stone pressing against his consciousness. "What do you want?"

"I have not been following you. I have been facilitating your escape through strategic resource deployment." Cornelius gestured toward the satchel with one claw, careful to keep the movement slow and non-threatening. "The three hundred crowns currently on that pedestal represent the liquidation of my most valuable manuscript. The Founder's annotated first edition of *The Chronicles of the Founding*. Sold to a private collector this afternoon and converted to currency specifically to fund your departure."

The magical pressure did not decrease but Photine's expression shifted toward confusion. "Why would you—"

"Because Demos is dying." Cornelius spoke the words with clinical precision. "His petrification is unstable. Biological processes continue beneath the stone without access to oxygen or nutrients. Current medical literature suggests he has perhaps three to six hours before permanent death."

"I know." The admission came out barely above a whisper. "I know he is dying. That is why I have to leave now before—"

"Before you are arrested for crimes you committed while trying to save your daughter."

The petrification magic released so abruptly that Cornelius felt the absence like sudden pressure drop. Photine took two steps backward and hit the wall beside the shelving units.

"I do not know what you think you know," she said, but her voice lacked conviction.

"I know that Melaina is your biological daughter." Cornelius remained in his corner, presenting no threat despite having information that could destroy her completely. "I know that Brother Demos falsified Temple birth records seventeen years ago to conceal her parentage. I know that genealogical laws make it illegal for someone of your social status to acknowledge a Gorgon child. And I know that you have spent nearly two decades protecting her through systematic deception that became increasingly desperate as she developed Medusa's Weep."

Photine's legs seemed to stop supporting her weight. She slid down the wall until she was sitting on the stone floor with her healer's robes pooling around her. The professional competence that had carried her through crisis after crisis simply dissolved.

"You cannot prove any of that," she said, but it came out hollow.

"I already destroyed the proof." Cornelius adjusted his spectacles with one claw. "The sealed birth record from Demos's locked desk drawer. The one he removed from public ledgers and secured in the Archives to protect both you and Melaina. I burned it three hours ago."

Photine stared at him. "Why would you—"

"Because preserving that document would have resulted in your arrest and execution. And your arrest would have resulted in Demos's permanent death because you are the only person capable of reversing his petrification." Cornelius moved fractionally forward, still careful to maintain non-threatening posture. "I chose to destroy evidence rather than allow preventable deaths."

"I did not mean to hurt him." The words spilled out with the particular desperation of someone who had been holding a confession for too long. "Melaina's condition was deteriorating. Nothing worked. Every treatment failed. Her feet were turning to stone and the progression was accelerating and I ran out of options."

"So you petrified her completely," Cornelius said. "Converted the disease-generated partial transformation into controlled full stasis to halt biological decay."

"It was the only way to stop the progression. Medusa's Weep is degenerative. Once it starts, it continues until the subject is completely transformed and then—" Photine's voice broke. "And then they are just stone. Forever. There is no reversing natural petrification once it reaches completion."

"But magical petrification can be reversed."

"If executed properly. If the subject is prepared correctly. If the transformation is smooth and complete and integrated with the existing disease process rather than fighting against it." Photine wrapped her arms around herself. "I spent months developing the technique. Testing variables. Calculating magical vectors. It worked perfectly when I finally performed the procedure."

"Then Niko arrived while you were completing Melaina's transformation."

"He was trying to help. Mother Ligeia had sent him to check on us because I had not returned her messages." Photine's hands were shaking again. "He saw Melaina in full stasis and panicked. Started asking questions I could not answer without revealing everything. So I—"

"So you petrified him as well to prevent information disclosure."

"I had to." The desperation in her voice made it clear she had been justifying this decision to herself repeatedly. "If word spread about Melaina's condition, the Temple would investigate. The Watch would demand records. Someone would discover her parentage and then—"

She stopped. Drew a shaking breath.

"Then they would execute you for genealogical fraud," Cornelius finished quietly. "And Melaina would be classified as illegal offspring subject to permanent institutional custody."

"She would be destroyed." Photine looked up at him with eyes that showed no hope remaining. "Magic. Law. Science. None of it matters. The Three Families have absolute authority over genealogical classification. A Gorgon child born to Kallistos bloodline would be eliminated as genetic contamination."

Cornelius thought of the elaborate social architecture that had created this situation. Genealogical laws designed to preserve family prestige. Medical systems that excluded patients based on payment capacity. Civic structures that forced mothers to choose between acknowledging their children and preserving those children's lives.

The civilization that built beautiful temples with optimal environmental controls had also constructed legal frameworks that destroyed families for arbitrary bloodline standards.

"What about Demos?" he asked. "His petrification was clearly different. Unstable. Incomplete."

Photine's expression crumpled completely. "That was an accident. He came to the Archives looking for old birth records. Research for his charity network tracking. He needed historical precedent for something. I do not even know what."

She pressed both palms against her face.

"He found me there. Right after I had finished Niko's transformation. I was exhausted and emotionally compromised and not thinking clearly. He saw the petrified forms. Started asking questions. Tried to help." Her voice dropped to barely audible. "The magic was still active. Still flowing. I lost control for just a moment and it spread to him before I could stop it."

"But you did stop it."

"Not soon enough. The transformation was partial. Rushed. Unstable. The opposite of what I had achieved with Melaina and Niko." Photine lowered her hands. "I knew immediately it was wrong. Knew he would start degrading. I tried to reverse it but I was too depleted. The magic would not respond. So I—"

"So you left him there and began planning escape."

"What else could I do?" The question came out as a desperate plea for understanding. "I could not fix him. Could not explain the situation to Temple authorities without condemning Melaina. Could not ask for help without revealing everything. The only option was to save who I could save and let the rest—"

"Let Demos die." Cornelius spoke the words she could not. "Sacrifice the person who falsified records to protect your family. Allow him to suffocate slowly inside unstable stone while you fled to safety with your daughter."

Photine flinched as though he had struck her physically.

"He sold his burial plot," Cornelius continued with deliberate precision. "Three months ago. Converted it to gold and used the money to purchase medicine for fever patients in the Gorgon Quarter. Patients the Temple refused to treat. Patients who would have died without his intervention."

"I know. I helped him arrange the sale."

"He bankrupted himself trying to help people the system had abandoned. Worked himself into exhaustion providing free care while maintaining public pretense of institutional compliance. Chose systematic self-destruction over allowing preventable deaths." Cornelius took one step forward. "And now you are going to let him die because saving him requires staying long enough to risk arrest."

"I cannot save him!" The words exploded out of Photine with force that made her entire body shake. "I tried! The reversal magic requires precision and time and resources I do not have anymore! I am too depleted! Too compromised! If I attempt the procedure now, I will fail and he will die anyway and I will be too exhausted to escape and Melaina will be discovered and executed and everything I have done—every crime I have committed—will be for nothing!"

Her breathing had become ragged. Tears ran down her face without producing any sound. The controlled professional facade had completely shattered, leaving only a woman who had made terrible calculations trying to protect her child.

Cornelius remained still and let her words echo in the confined space.

Then he moved to the pedestal and carefully pushed the leather satchel toward her side of the marble surface.

"This gold is yours," he said quietly. "No conditions. No demands for repayment. No obligation beyond accepting it. You can take it and leave right now. Walk to the docks. Board the Constant Stanza. Sail away with Mother Ligeia and the other evacuees. Start a new life in a city without genealogical persecution. Save your daughter."

Photine stared at the satchel but made no move to take it.

"However," Cornelius continued, "if you leave without reversing Demos's petrification, he will be dead before sunset tomorrow. And his death will be on you the same way Melaina's survival is on you. The same way every patient you ever chose to save instead of someone else is on you. The same way every impossible decision you made during triage is on you."

"That is not fair."

"No. It is not fair. None of this is fair. The systems that forced you into this position are not fair. The laws that make it illegal to acknowledge your child are not fair. The medical resource allocation that leaves children dying for lack of medicine is not fair." Cornelius gestured toward the empty shelving units. "But fair does not enter this equation. Only choice. Only what you do with the limited time and depleted magic you have remaining."

Photine slowly stood, using the wall for support. "Why do you care? Demos is nothing to you. Just another Archive casualty you documented for historical record."

"Demos is someone who destroyed himself trying to help people the Temple excluded. Someone who saw systematic injustice and chose active resistance rather than comfortable complicity." Cornelius held her gaze without deploying petrification magic himself. "Someone who made choices I am only beginning to understand were correct even when they violated every institutional rule I spent a century enforcing."

"You cannot ask me to risk my daughter's life for him."

"I am not asking. I am presenting information and allowing you to make informed decisions." Cornelius moved back toward his corner. "You have perhaps ninety minutes until the Constant Stanza departs. Melaina is currently secured in my hidden archive under adequate environmental controls. She can remain there indefinitely if necessary. But Demos cannot. His biological processes are degrading. Soon the damage will be irreversible."

"How soon?"

"Unknown. Possibly three hours. Possibly less. Medical literature on unstable petrification reversal is limited because most practitioners recognize it as emergency malpractice requiring immediate correction."

Photine closed her eyes. "If I attempt the reversal and fail, I use my remaining magic for nothing. I am too exhausted to try again. Too compromised to reach the docks before Watch discovery. Melaina and I are both arrested and executed."

"If you attempt the reversal and succeed, Demos survives. You depart with diminished magical reserves but sufficient time to reach the ship and escape."

"And if I just leave now?"

"Then you survive. Melaina survives. Demos dies. And you spend the rest of your life knowing you sacrificed the person who protected your family when protection required falsifying official records and accepting personal risk." Cornelius adjusted his spectacles. "That is the equation. I cannot make it balance differently. I can only provide accurate information about variables."

Silence expanded in the Vault. Photine stood against the wall. Cornelius stood in his corner. The satchel of gold sat on the marble pedestal between them like physical manifestation of impossible moral mathematics.

Finally Photine spoke, her voice barely above a whisper.

"Where is he? Demos?"

"The Archives. Precisely where you left him three days ago."

"And Melaina?"

"My hidden archive. Secured. Protected. Waiting for your return."

"If I do this—if I reverse his petrification—you will help me extract Melaina and reach the ship before departure?"

"Yes. I will personally transport both of you to the docks. I will provide the additional three hundred crowns for emergency contingencies. I will do everything within my capacity to ensure successful escape." Cornelius paused. "But only if you save Demos first."

Photine looked at the gold. At Cornelius. At the empty shelving units that represented systematic institutional failure.

Then she straightened her shoulders with visible effort and moved to the pedestal. Her hands still shook as she lifted the leather satchel, but her expression had shifted back toward professional determination.

"I will need complete privacy for the procedure," she said. "No observation. No documentation. No witnesses who can later testify about methodology."

"Understood."

"And if this fails—if he dies during reversal—"

"Then you tried. That will have to be sufficient." Cornelius moved toward the door. "I will position myself outside the Archives to ensure Watch interference does not compromise the procedure. How long will you require?"

"Twenty minutes if everything proceeds optimally. Possibly longer if complications arise."

"The Constant Stanza departs at sunset. You have approximately seventy-five minutes total including travel time to the docks." Cornelius opened the Vault door. "I suggest you proceed immediately."

Photine moved past him into the corridor. She walked with the exhausted determination of someone who had made terrible calculations and would now follow through on consequences regardless of personal cost.

Cornelius watched her go. Watched the lamplight catch on her scarred healer's hands. Watched her disappear around the corner toward the Archives where Demos waited in unstable stone.

Then he closed the Vault door and locked it carefully.

The equation still did not balance perfectly. Too many variables. Too many moral compromises. Too many people making desperate choices in systems designed to force exactly these impossible decisions.

But at least now everyone had what they needed to survive.

At least now the preservation would extend to people instead of just objects.

At least now Cornelius understood what his hoard had actually been for all along.

He moved through the Temple corridors toward the Archives, his claws clicking against stone floors with steady rhythm.

Time to see if desperate magic and depleted healers could reverse three days of biological degradation.

Time to see if preservation really could extend to the impossibly broken things.

Time to see if the game could actually end with everyone surviving instead of just some.

The Archives waited ahead in careful silence.

And somewhere inside, Photine was attempting to save the person who had protected her family when protection required crimes that institutional law would classify as unforgivable.

Cornelius settled into position outside the Archive entrance and began counting minutes.

Seventy-five until departure.

Twenty for the reversal procedure.

Fifty-five remaining for extraction and escape.

The mathematics were tight but functional.

If everything proceeded optimally.

If nothing else went catastrophically wrong.

If desperate healers could work miracles with depleted magic and impossible timelines.

Cornelius watched the corridor and waited.

The final move had been made.

Now they would discover whether the game ended in checkmate or stalemate.

Whether preservation meant saving everyone or just accepting which losses were survivable.

Whether the equation would ever actually balance.

# Chapter 19

# Chapter 19

Cornelius positioned himself directly outside the Archive entrance with his back to the heavy oak door and his attention focused on the corridor beyond.

The Temple's administrative wing remained eerily silent. No footsteps. No voices. No scratch of quills documenting endless bureaucratic details. Just the faint background hum of a massive stone building settling into evening temperatures.

Behind him, through the closed door, Sister Photine was attempting to reverse three days of biological degradation with depleted magic and approximately twenty minutes before the margin between "difficult procedure" and "impossible procedure" collapsed entirely.

Cornelius checked his internal chronometer again. Seventeen minutes had elapsed since Photine entered the Archives. The Constant Stanza would sail in approximately fifty-eight minutes regardless of passenger arrival status. Travel time from Temple to docks required minimum fifteen minutes at aggressive pace. Mathematical conclusion: they had perhaps twenty-five minutes of functional buffer assuming optimal conditions and zero complications.

The odds were not encouraging.

A sound reached him through the door—low and resonant, like stone grinding against stone but with musical qualities that indicated magical rather than mechanical origin.

Cornelius's scales prickled with involuntary response to proximity magic. The sensation was not quite painful but fundamentally uncomfortable in the way that touching unfamiliar magical signatures always produced physical feedback.

The sound intensified. Became a sustained note that vibrated through the door and into Cornelius's bones with pressure that made his teeth ache.

He recognized the acoustic signature now. Reversal magic. The specific frequencies required to convince stone that it should remember being flesh. Complex harmonic structures that had to be sustained without variation while simultaneously channeling magical energy through precise pathways.

Photine had described the theoretical framework once during a casual conversation about archaeological preservation techniques. Cornelius had found the mathematics elegant even while acknowledging he possessed no capacity to execute the actual procedure.

The sound shifted. Dropped to a lower register. The vibration against Cornelius's scales changed quality—became smoother, less harsh, almost liquid in its flow.

Good sign. Probably. Cornelius was interpreting magical feedback through dragon physiology that had evolved for completely different environmental pressures. His analysis might be entirely inaccurate.

Behind him, something made a sound like breaking glass except softer and with more organic qualities.

Cornelius resisted the overwhelming urge to turn around and verify what was happening. Photine had demanded complete privacy. No observation. No documentation. No witnesses.

He had agreed to those terms.

So he remained facing the corridor and forced himself to trust that violent cracking sounds were normal components of petrification reversal rather than indicators of catastrophic magical failure.

The quarter-hour bell chimed from the civic tower.

Fifty-five minutes until departure.

The magical hum behind the door reached crescendo that made Cornelius's scales vibrate in sympathetic resonance. The sensation was profoundly unpleasant—like being too close to a massive tuning fork while someone struck it repeatedly.

Then silence.

Complete, absolute silence that felt wrong after sustained magical pressure.

Cornelius counted seconds. One. Two. Three. Four.

A sound emerged from the Archives that was distinctly organic and decidedly not stone.

Coughing. Wet and harsh. The specific sound of lungs that had not processed air properly for extended period attempting to remember their primary function.

Relief flooded through Cornelius with intensity that surprised him. Demos was breathing. The reversal had worked. Biological processes were resuming normal function.

More coughing. Then a voice, hoarse and confused: "What—where—"

Photine's response was too quiet for Cornelius to distinguish words through the door, but the tone carried obvious relief mixed with urgency.

Cornelius remained at his post and gave them privacy for whatever reunion was occurring. His role was guard, not participant. His function was preventing Watch interference, not witnessing family reconciliation.

Demos spoke again, louder this time: "Three days? I have been stone for three days?"

Photine's answer was still indistinct but carried the particular cadence of someone explaining complicated circumstances very rapidly.

"The baby?" Demos's voice cracked on the words. "Is she—"

"Safe." Photine's single word carried clearly through the door. "She is safe."

A long pause filled only with Demos's labored breathing.

Then: "Show me."

Footsteps approached the door from inside. Cornelius stepped aside as the Archive entrance swung inward.

Photine emerged first, her face showing the specific exhaustion that indicated complete magical depletion. Her hands shook. Her shoulders slumped. She looked as though she might collapse if she stopped moving.

Behind her, Demos leaned heavily against the doorframe.

Cornelius had catalogued Demos's appearance extensively during investigation. Cheerful features. Disorganized presentation. The particular energy that characterized competent people who maintained chaotic organizational systems.

The person currently occupying Demos's body looked nothing like that mental image.

His skin showed the grayish pallor that indicated recent magical trauma. His eyes were unfocused. His breathing remained uneven. He moved with the careful precision of someone whose body was not quite responding correctly to neural commands.

But he was alive.

Breathing.

Functional.

No longer slowly suffocating inside unstable stone.

Demos's gaze found Cornelius and stopped with the particular sharpness that indicated recognition despite obvious disorientation.

"Library Dragon," he said hoarsely. "You are involved in whatever this is."

"I am facilitating necessary logistical support," Cornelius replied carefully.

"That is definitely involvement." Demos pushed away from the doorframe with visible effort. "Someone explain what is happening before I fall over or start asking official questions."

Photine moved to support him but Demos waved her away. He remained standing through what was clearly significant willpower rather than actual physical stability.

"The short version," Photine said, her voice carrying the clipped efficiency of medical crisis management. "Melaina's condition deteriorated beyond conventional treatment options. I developed an experimental preservation protocol using controlled petrification. The procedure worked. She is stable. But complications arose that required—"

"You petrified our daughter." Demos's tone was flat. "Then you petrified me. Accidentally I am assuming, based on the fact that I currently feel as though someone used me for masonry practice."

"The magical discharge was unintended. I attempted immediate reversal but lacked sufficient reserves." Photine's hands clenched into fists. "I made the choice to prioritize Melaina's extraction and escape over your immediate restoration."

"Understandable triage decision given resource constraints and relative survival margins." Demos swayed slightly but remained upright. "Where is she now?"

"Hidden archive in the library," Cornelius said. "Secured. Protected. Awaiting extraction before departure."

Demos's gaze sharpened further. "Departure. Someone is leaving. On a ship presumably, given harbor proximity and current civic tensions regarding Gorgon community status."

"The Constant Stanza," Photine said quietly. "Sailing at sunset. Passage arranged for six."

"And you are one of the six."

"Yes."

"Along with Melaina."

"Yes."

Demos nodded slowly. His attention moved to the leather satchel that Photine had set down during the reversal procedure. The satchel that contained three hundred gold crowns.

"That is Temple property," he observed. "Emergency medical reserves kept in the Vault for crisis response funding."

"Actually," Cornelius interjected, "that currency represents the liquidation of my personal manuscript collection. Specifically the Founder's annotated first edition of The Chronicles of the Founding, sold to private collector this afternoon and converted to gold for purposes of funding escape logistics."

Demos stared at him. "You sold the Founder's Chronicles."

"Yes."

"The manuscript you threatened to petrify me over when I accidentally spilled tea near it five years ago."

"The threat was hyperbolic and you know it. I do not possess petrification capabilities." Cornelius adjusted his spectacles. "But yes. That manuscript. Sold. Converted to currency. Currently funding your sister's escape from prosecution."

"Sister." Demos's voice went very quiet on the word. "How long have you known?"

"Approximately six hours. I discovered the sealed birth record you removed from public ledgers and secured in your locked desk drawer. The document that identified Photine as Melaina's biological mother and you as official witness to birth registration."

"That record is classified Temple property protected by—"

"I burned it," Cornelius said calmly. "Three hours ago. Reduced it to ash to eliminate evidence that would result in Photine's arrest and execution for genealogical fraud."

The silence that followed carried weight that pressed against Cornelius's awareness like physical presence.

Demos slowly sat down on a nearby chair with the careful movements of someone whose legs had stopped reliably supporting body weight.

"You destroyed official Temple documentation," he said.

"Yes."

"To protect my sister from legal consequences of her illegal child."

"Yes."

"And then sold your most valuable possession to fund her escape."

"Yes."

"Why?"

The question was simple but contained layers of genuine confusion. Cornelius took a moment to formulate accurate response.

"Because you sold your burial plot to purchase medicine for patients the Temple refused to treat. Because you bankrupted yourself providing charity care to people the system had abandoned. Because you falsified records to protect family when protection required accepting criminal liability." Cornelius met Demos's unfocused gaze directly. "Because preservation sometimes requires spending the things we value most rather than hoarding them indefinitely."

Demos made a sound that was not quite a laugh. "That is extremely specific moral reasoning."

"I have been developing concerning facility with criminal ethics over the past three days."

"Apparently." Demos looked at Photine. She had moved to stand against the far wall, watching the conversation with the tension of someone awaiting judgment. "You need to leave. Now. Before this gets more complicated."

"Demo—"

"The Temple will discover the Vault withdrawal within hours. They will investigate. They will find falsified quarantine paperwork and missing reserves." Demos spoke with the methodical precision of someone working through bureaucratic procedures despite obvious physical distress. "I will report that you submitted emergency authorization for restricted medical supplies. That you claimed exposure incident requiring immediate intervention. That I processed the withdrawal according to standard protocols because I trusted your medical assessment."

Photine's expression shifted toward something that looked painfully like hope. "They will not believe that. They will know I was lying."

"They will suspect you were lying. But I will insist I followed procedure correctly based on information provided by senior healer with appropriate authority." Demos leaned back in the chair. "The investigation will take weeks. By then you will be gone. Melaina will be safe. And the Temple will have to decide whether to prosecute me for administrative negligence or accept that their emergency protocols are vulnerable to exploitation."

"You are giving me time," Photine whispered.

"I am documenting that proper bureaucratic channels were followed and any irregularities resulted from my insufficient verification rather than your deliberate fraud." Demos gestured weakly toward the satchel. "Take the gold. Get our daughter. Board your ship. Start the life you should have been allowed to have seventeen years ago."

Photine crossed the space between them in three quick steps and dropped to her knees beside his chair. She gripped his hands with intensity that suggested she might never let go.

"I left you to die," she said, her voice breaking. "I chose her over you and I would do it again and I am so sorry—"

"I know. I would have made the same choice." Demos managed a weak smile that looked more like a grimace. "You are her mother. I am just her uncle who falsified some paperwork. The mathematics are obvious."

"The mathematics are terrible." Photine pressed her forehead against his hands. "I do not want to leave you."

"I do not want you to stay. Not if staying means execution." Demos gently extracted one hand and touched her face. "Go. Please. Before I change my mind and start asking questions I definitely do not want answered."

Photine stood slowly. She picked up the leather satchel with shaking hands. Looked at Demos. Looked at Cornelius.

"Thank you," she said to both of them. "For everything. For the impossible things."

Then she turned and walked quickly toward the corridor that led to the library's hidden archive entrance.

Cornelius remained stationary, watching her departure. Behind him, Demos made a sound that might have been suppressed sob or might have been residual coughing from petrification reversal complications.

"You should go with her," Demos said quietly. "Make sure she actually boards the ship. Make sure Melaina extracts safely. Make sure—" His voice failed.

"I will ensure successful departure." Cornelius moved toward the corridor. "What will you tell the Watch when they ask about tonight?"

"That I woke up in the Archives after three days of unexplained petrification. That you were investigating the incident as part of your historical documentation responsibilities. That Sister Photine had been under extreme stress due to ongoing medical crisis and submitted questionable emergency requisition that I processed according to standard protocols." Demos leaned his head back against the chair. "By the time they organize proper interrogation, at least twelve hours will have elapsed. More than sufficient window for ship departure and maritime jurisdiction transfer."

"That explanation contains significant logical inconsistencies."

"Yes. Welcome to bureaucratic mercy. Where official stories do not need to be true as long as they preserve institutional stability." Demos closed his eyes. "Now go. Before I demonstrate proper civic responsibility and raise the alarm."

Cornelius hesitated fractionally. "You sold your burial plot to help people the Temple excluded."

"Yes. Seemed like a reasonable resource allocation at the time."

"When this resolves and you require new arrangements, the library maintains historical cemetery plots reserved for civic servants who die in service to knowledge preservation. I will ensure you have access to adequate resting space."

Demos's eyes opened. "That is unexpectedly thoughtful."

"I am told I am experiencing delayed moral development." Cornelius turned toward the corridor. "Try not to die from reversal complications in the immediate future. The paperwork would be extremely inconvenient."

"I will do my best to avoid death by bureaucratic inconvenience."

Cornelius moved quickly through the Temple's administrative corridors. The building remained quiet around him—evening skeleton staff concentrated elsewhere, most personnel departed for the day, nothing but stone and silence filling spaces usually occupied by professional activity.

He found Photine in the hidden archive antechamber. She had already extracted Melaina from the climate-controlled preservation chamber. The girl remained in full magical stasis—stone features peaceful, hands folded, the perfect stillness that indicated properly executed petrification rather than Demos's unstable transformation.

"Can you carry her?" Photine asked. Her voice was steady now. Professional. The transformation from breaking sister to competent mother complete.

"Yes. Stone weighs less than equivalent flesh due to density alterations during magical transformation." Cornelius moved carefully beneath Melaina's petrified form. "Secure her positioning. We need to minimize movement during flight to prevent structural stress."

Photine arranged Melaina across Cornelius's shoulders with the practiced efficiency of someone who had handled many unconscious patients. The weight settled with surprising comfort—distributed correctly, balanced properly, entirely manageable for dragon physiology designed to carry substantial loads.

"The satchel," Cornelius said. "You need both hands free during extraction. I can carry gold and passenger simultaneously."

Photine secured the leather satchel against Melaina's stone form using strips of cloth torn from her healer's robes. The improvised harness was functional if inelegant.

"Ready," she said.

They moved through the library's back corridors toward the courtyard exit. Photine walked with the quick purposeful stride of someone who had made final decisions and would not allow hesitation.

The courtyard was empty. The sky showed the particular golden quality that preceded sunset. Shadows lengthened. Temperature dropped fractionally.

Cornelius spread his wings and crouched to allow Photine to climb onto his back behind Melaina's secured form.

"Hold tightly," he instructed. "I will be flying faster than is strictly advisable for passenger comfort."

"Understood."

Cornelius launched himself upward with enough force to clear the library's outer walls. The additional weight of two passengers—one stone, one flesh—required adjustment to his normal flight mechanics but remained well within operational capacity.

The city spread below. Stone buildings. Organized streets. Civic architecture that looked deceptively peaceful from elevation despite the systematic injustices embedded in its legal frameworks.

Cornelius turned toward the harbor and increased airspeed beyond comfortable limits.

Behind him, Photine's grip tightened against his shoulders but she made no sound of protest.

The docks appeared ahead—the organized chaos of maritime commerce compressed into narrow space between city proper and open water. Ships crowded against berths. Cargo moved between warehouses and vessels. Workers shouted coordination across distances.

And there, at the seediest peripheral berth, the Constant Stanza waited with characteristic smuggler efficiency.

Cornelius descended rapidly toward the dock beside the ship. His landing was harder than optimal due to excessive speed and passenger load but functionally adequate.

Photine dismounted immediately and began untying Melaina's harness with shaking hands.

"Photine!" Mother Ligeia's voice carried from the ship's deck. "You are late. We were preparing to sail without—" She stopped as she registered Melaina's stone form. "You brought her."

"She is stable. Properly preserved. Ready for transport." Photine lifted Melaina with visible effort—the stone daughter heavy despite magical density alterations. "I have passage payment. I have—"

"We know. The dragon sent advance notification through alternative channels." Ligeia gestured to sailors who appeared at the railing. "Bring her aboard. Quickly."

Sailors descended via rope ladder and helped transfer Melaina's petrified form up to the deck. Photine followed, climbing with desperate speed.

She paused at the railing. Looked back at Cornelius standing alone on the dock.

"Tell Demos—" Her voice broke. "Tell him I will write when we reach safety. Tell him I love him. Tell him—"

"I will convey appropriate messages," Cornelius said.

Photine nodded. Disappeared over the railing.

The Constant Stanza's crew moved with practiced efficiency. Ropes were cast off. Sails unfurled. The ship pulled away from the dock with the smooth competence of professionals who had executed many rapid departures.

Cornelius watched until the vessel cleared the harbor entrance and turned toward open water.

The sun touched the horizon.

Sunset.

Exactly on schedule.

Behind him, footsteps approached on the dock. Cornelius turned to find Zeph running toward him with the particular urgency that indicated new complications.

"Captain Theo is at the library," Zeph gasped. "Looking for you. He knows about the Vault withdrawal. He is assembling Watch patrol to search the docks."

"Irrelevant. The ship has sailed. Maritime jurisdiction transfers once vessels clear harbor limits." Cornelius looked at the Constant Stanza's diminishing silhouette. "Photine is beyond his reach now."

"What about Demos?"

"Demos is providing bureaucratic cover story that will delay investigation long enough for escape to succeed." Cornelius began walking back toward the library. "We should return before Theo decides to expand his search parameters."

They moved through darkening streets. The civic bells chimed the hour. Lamps were being lit in windows. The city settled into evening routines.

Cornelius thought about equations that would never quite balance. About preservation that required spending treasured possessions. About systems so broken that the only ethical response was systematic subversion.

"Did we just help someone escape prosecution?" Zeph asked quietly.

"We ensured that a family stayed together rather than being destroyed by unjust genealogical laws." Cornelius adjusted his spectacles. "The distinction is philosophically significant even if legally irrelevant."

"So yes. We helped a criminal escape."

"Yes. We did."

"Good," Zeph said with surprising firmness. "Because those laws are terrible and someone should break them."

Cornelius felt something that might have been pride or might have been relief that Zeph understood the moral reasoning behind recent criminal activities.

They reached the library as full darkness settled over the city. Cornelius could see Watch patrol assembling near the temple—torches being distributed, search assignments being delegated, Captain Theo's distinctive silhouette coordinating operations.

But the Constant Stanza was already gone, carrying six refugees toward cities that did not prosecute mothers for the crime of protecting their children.

And in the Temple Archives, Demos was preparing bureaucratic explanations that would technically be lies but functionally preserve institutional stability.

And in the library's hidden chambers, empty spaces marked where petrified patients had waited before being freed to sail toward safety.

Cornelius entered his library and locked the door carefully behind them.

The familiar scent of old paper and preserved knowledge surrounded him with immediate comfort.

His hoard was smaller now. Missing its centerpiece manuscript. Diminished by strategic liquidation.

But preservation had never really been about keeping everything perfectly intact forever.

Sometimes it was about knowing what to spend and when to spend it.

Sometimes it was about choosing people over objects.

Sometimes it was about accepting that the most valuable things could not be catalogued or shelved or kept in climate-controlled storage.

Cornelius settled onto his roost and looked at the empty space where the Founder's Chronicles had rested for more than a century.

The loss was real.

But the mathematics finally balanced.

Human problems required human solutions.

Even when those solutions involved dragons committing crimes to preserve families that institutional law deemed illegal.

Zeph climbed the stairs to his reading nook. "What happens now?"

"Now we wait for Theo to complete his fruitless dock search. We provide appropriately vague responses to official questions. We maintain bureaucratic cover stories long enough for maritime jurisdiction transfer to become permanent." Cornelius closed his eyes. "And we hope that Demos's reversal complications do not prove fatal before the investigation concludes."

"He will be fine. He survived three days as stone. Everything else is easy by comparison."

Cornelius hoped that optimistic assessment proved accurate.

The library settled into evening silence around them.

Outside, Watch patrols searched empty docks for fugitives who were already beyond their reach.

And somewhere at sea, a mother held her stone daughter and sailed toward cities that might allow them both to simply exist.

The game was finished.

The preservation was complete.

The equation balanced.

Or at least balanced well enough to count as victory.

Cornelius allowed himself to feel something approaching satisfaction.

He had spent one hundred and twenty-seven years hoarding knowledge.

Perhaps the next century would involve learning how to spend it wisely.

# Chapter 20

# Chapter 20

The Constant Stanza cleared the harbor entrance as the sun touched the western horizon.

Cornelius stood on the dock watching the ship's silhouette diminish against the darkening water. Behind him, Zeph shifted weight from foot to foot with the nervous energy that characterized adolescents forced to remain stationary during moments of significance.

"They made it," Zeph said quietly. "Photine and Melaina both. They actually made it."

"Maritime jurisdiction transfers once vessels pass beyond harbor limits." Cornelius tracked the ship's progress with the same focused attention he applied to cataloguing manuscript provenance. "Current distance places them firmly outside civic authority. Yes. They made it."

The dock smelled of brine and tar and the particular combination of fish and unwashed humanity that characterized working harbors. Cornelius found the olfactory assault profoundly unpleasant but remained committed to witnessing complete departure before returning to his properly organized library.

Zeph exhaled slowly. "I thought Theo would get here faster. I thought we would have to actually lie to his face instead of just watching the ship leave."

"Captain Theo's arrival timing was delayed by my earlier misinformation regarding dock location." Cornelius adjusted his spectacles with one claw. "I may have suggested the Constant Stanza was berthed at the commercial pier rather than the smuggler's quarter. Simple administrative error. Could happen to anyone."

"You lied to the Watch Captain."

"I provided inaccurate information based on incomplete dock manifests." Cornelius kept his attention on the departing ship. "The distinction is philosophically significant even if functionally irrelevant."

Zeph made a sound that indicated suppressed laughter. "You are getting very good at this."

"At what specifically?"

"Crime. You are getting very good at crime."

Before Cornelius could formulate appropriate response to that disturbingly accurate assessment, footsteps approached on the dock behind them. Multiple sets. Moving with the organized rhythm that indicated Watch patrol rather than casual pedestrian traffic.

"Library Dragon." Captain Theo's voice carried the particular exhaustion that indicated someone who had been running investigations for extended periods without adequate sleep. "I need to ask you some questions about events at the Temple of Althaia this evening."

Cornelius turned to face the Watch Captain. Theo stood flanked by four guards carrying torches that cast flickering illumination across the dock. His uniform was disheveled. His expression showed the specific tension that preceded difficult interrogations.

Behind the guards, Brother Demos leaned heavily against a dock post. He had clearly followed Theo from the Temple despite obvious physical distress. His skin still showed the grayish pallor that indicated recent magical trauma but his eyes were alert and focused.

"Captain." Cornelius adopted the formal neutral tone he employed during civic disputes. "I am happy to provide whatever assistance the Watch requires."

"The Temple Vault was accessed this evening using Senior Healer Photine Kallistos's authorization codes." Theo pulled a folded paper from his belt. "Emergency withdrawal. Two thousand crowns. Justified by supposed quarantine exposure requiring immediate medical intervention."

"I see." Cornelius remained perfectly still.

"However, when Temple administration attempted to verify the emergency, Senior Healer Photine could not be located. Archive records show you were present in the Temple this evening during the relevant timeframe." Theo's gaze moved to Zeph. "Both of you were documented entering the administrative wing approximately ninety minutes ago."

Zeph opened his mouth. Closed it. Looked at Cornelius with the specific panic that indicated someone who had no idea what to say during official interrogation.

"We were conducting archival research," Cornelius said calmly. "Brother Demos requested assistance locating historical medical records related to his current patient caseload. I provided standard reference services."

"Archival research." Theo's tone suggested significant skepticism. "In the Temple Vault. During a medical emergency."

"We were not in the Vault. We were in the public Archives reviewing birth ledgers and treatment protocols." Cornelius gestured toward Demos with one wing. "Brother Demos can confirm the nature of our research."

All attention shifted to Demos. He pushed away from the dock post with visible effort and moved to stand beside Cornelius.

"The Library Dragon is correct," Demos said. His voice was hoarse but steady. "I asked him to help me locate precedent documentation for unusual medical cases. He provided expert assistance navigating Temple archive organization. Which is—" He paused to cough wetly. "—which is extremely complicated and benefits from professional guidance."

Theo stared at Demos with the intensity that indicated visual assessment of physical condition. "You look terrible."

"Fever root allergy. Recent onset. Very unpleasant." Demos managed a weak smile. "I was exposed during patient treatment approximately three days ago. The reaction was severe enough to produce temporary petrification-like symptoms. Sister Photine reversed the effect this evening using standard antihistamine protocols. I am still recovering from the physiological stress."

The silence that followed carried weight that pressed against Cornelius's awareness like physical presence.

Captain Theo looked at Demos. At Cornelius. At Zeph. Back to Demos.

Then, very slowly, he folded the paper and returned it to his belt.

"Fever root allergy," he repeated.

"Yes. Apparently I have developed sensitivity to the concentrated extract. Sister Photine has recommended I avoid direct handling of undiluted preparations in future." Demos coughed again. "She documented the incident in her medical log before departing for—" He paused. "Before departing."

"Departing." Theo's voice had gone extremely flat. "Where exactly did Senior Healer Photine depart to?"

"I believe she mentioned needing rest after the emergency reversal procedure." Demos swayed slightly but remained upright. "The magical expenditure was significant. She was quite depleted."

"So you do not know her current location."

"No. I assumed she returned to her dormitory quarters."

Theo rubbed his face with both hands. The gesture suggested someone processing information that contradicted preferred conclusions.

"The Vault withdrawal," he said finally. "Two thousand crowns. For quarantine supplies."

"Emergency requisition." Demos nodded. "I authorized the withdrawal based on Sister Photine's medical assessment. She indicated potential exposure incident requiring immediate intervention supplies. I processed the paperwork according to standard protocols."

"What kind of exposure?"

"She did not specify details. Patient confidentiality restrictions." Demos met Theo's gaze directly. "I trusted her professional judgment. If the requisition was inappropriate, the administrative error is mine. I should have requested more detailed justification before approving emergency access."

Cornelius watched Captain Theo's expression shift through several configurations. Suspicion. Frustration. Something that looked disturbingly like relief.

"Fever root allergy," Theo said again.

"Very severe reaction." Demos gestured at his own appearance. "As you can observe."

"And the two thousand crowns."

"Emergency medical supplies. Properly documented through official channels. If there are concerns about procedural irregularities, I will submit full accounting to Temple administration for review." Demos paused. "Though I expect the investigation will take several weeks given current administrative backlog."

The corner of Theo's mouth twitched. Not quite a smile. Just the suggestion that he recognized the game being played and had decided not to interfere with its conclusion.

"Several weeks," he repeated.

"At minimum. Possibly longer if complications arise." Demos coughed one more time. "I really should return to the Temple infirmary. This recovery process is quite uncomfortable."

Theo looked past them toward the harbor entrance. The Constant Stanza was barely visible now—just a distant shape against darkening water.

"I was told Senior Healer Photine might be attempting to leave the city," he said quietly. "Unverified information. Probably unreliable."

"People say many things during investigations," Cornelius observed. "Much of it proves inaccurate upon proper verification."

"Yes. Much of it." Theo turned back to his guards. "The dock search is completed. No fugitives located. We are returning to the station."

The guards exchanged glances but followed orders without verbal protest. They formed up and began marching back toward the civic quarter with torches creating bobbing circles of illumination in the darkness.

Theo remained stationary for one additional moment. He looked at Demos with the same intensity from before—but the underlying emotion had shifted from suspicion to something that looked painfully like concern.

"Take care of yourself," he said. "Fever root allergies can be serious."

"I will be more careful in future." Demos managed another weak smile. "Thank you for your concern, Captain."

Theo nodded once. Then he turned and followed his patrol back toward the city proper.

Silence expanded on the dock. Cornelius counted his own heartbeats. One. Two. Three. Four.

Demos sat down abruptly on a cargo crate. "That was terrifying."

"You performed adequately under interrogation pressure." Cornelius moved to stand beside the crate. "The fever root allergy explanation was creative if medically questionable."

"It was the first thing I thought of that explained petrification symptoms without requiring actual Gorgon involvement." Demos leaned forward and put his head in his hands. "Also, I definitely have something wrong with my body because sitting down feels significantly better than standing."

Zeph approached cautiously. "Are you going to be okay?"

"Probably. Photine said the reversal was successful. I just need rest and normal food and time for my system to remember how biological processes work." Demos looked up. "She got away. Melaina got away. They are both safe."

"Yes," Cornelius confirmed. "Maritime jurisdiction. Beyond civic authority. Safe."

"Good. That is good." Demos closed his eyes. "Even if it means I now have to maintain a fictional fever root allergy indefinitely to explain why I was temporarily petrified."

"Bureaucratic mercy," Cornelius said. "Where official stories do not need to be true as long as they preserve institutional stability."

"I hate that I taught you that concept." Demos stood up slowly. "I am going back to the Temple. I need to submit preliminary incident reports before someone decides to conduct thorough investigation."

"Do you require assistance walking?"

"I will manage. The Temple is close and I have survived worse." Demos looked at Cornelius for a long moment. "Thank you. For everything. For the impossible things."

"You sold your burial plot to help people the system excluded." Cornelius adjusted his spectacles. "I sold a book. The mathematics favor your sacrifice significantly."

"The mathematics do not account for sentimental value." Demos gestured toward the library in the distance. "That manuscript meant something to you. Selling it cost you more than gold."

Cornelius felt something uncomfortable shift in his chest. "Preservation requires strategic resource allocation. Sometimes that includes spending treasured possessions rather than hoarding them indefinitely."

"Yes. Sometimes it does." Demos turned toward the city. "I will visit the library when this resolves. We should have tea and discuss our various criminal activities."

"I do not drink tea. However, I will tolerate your presence while you consume beverages in my reading room."

"High praise from a dragon." Demos managed a genuine smile this time. "Goodnight, Library Dragon. Goodnight, Zeph."

He walked away with careful steps that suggested someone whose body was not entirely reliable. His silhouette disappeared into the darkness beyond the dock.

Zeph exhaled slowly. "He is going to be okay."

"Probably. Photine is competent healer. The reversal procedure was successful." Cornelius spread his wings. "We should return to the library. I have been away from my collections for unacceptable duration."

"You have been committing crimes for three days. The books survived without you."

"The books always survive. That is their advantage over people." Cornelius crouched to allow Zeph to climb onto his back. "But I prefer to verify collection integrity personally rather than relying on architectural stability alone."

Zeph settled into position. "Do you think Theo knew? About Photine leaving?"

"Captain Theo accepted obviously questionable medical explanation for documented magical crime with minimal investigation." Cornelius launched himself upward. "Either he is significantly less competent than professional reputation suggests, or he deliberately chose not to pursue evidence that would require arresting someone he preferred to believe innocent."

"So yes. He knew."

"He suspected. He chose not to confirm suspicions. The distinction matters for official record even if practical outcome remains identical."

They flew over the city in comfortable silence. Below them, civic life continued with usual evening patterns. Lamps being lit. Doors being closed. The organized rhythm of civilization settling into night.

The library appeared ahead—familiar silhouette against darkening sky. Cornelius felt something in his chest relax at the sight of his territory properly secured and waiting.

He landed in the courtyard and Zeph dismounted quickly.

"I am going to sleep for approximately twelve hours," Zeph announced. "Possibly longer if nobody wakes me up for emergencies."

"Acceptable plan. I will manage morning operations independently." Cornelius moved toward the main entrance. "Thank you for your assistance during recent complications."

Zeph stopped. Turned. "Are you being nice to me?"

"I am acknowledging competent performance under difficult circumstances."

"You are definitely being nice. This is weird." Zeph grinned. "You are welcome. For helping you commit various crimes in the name of justice."

He disappeared into the library before Cornelius could formulate appropriate response to that characterization.

Cornelius remained in the courtyard for several additional minutes. The air had cooled significantly. His scales adjusted temperature automatically but he still felt the shift in environmental conditions.

Three days ago he had been hiding books to prevent their inclusion in charity donation.

Three days ago his primary concern had been preserving collection integrity above all other considerations.

Three days ago he had believed that hoarding knowledge was the same thing as protecting it.

The person occupying his body now felt like different creature entirely.

Cornelius spread his wings and launched himself upward one final time. He landed on his customary roost and settled into the familiar depression his body had worn into stone over decades of occupation.

The library stretched below him in organized perfection. Shelves aligned. Books properly secured. Environmental controls maintaining optimal preservation conditions.

Everything exactly as it should be.

Except.

His gaze found the specific shelf near the historical archives section. The shelf where the Founder's annotated Chronicles of the Founding had rested for one hundred and three years before this afternoon.

The gap was obvious. A space precisely the dimensions of that irreplaceable manuscript. Empty now. Converted to currency. Spent on human problems that required human solutions.

Cornelius stared at the absence for a long time.

He waited for the grief to arrive. The desperate regret. The overwhelming sense of loss that should accompany sacrificing something irreplaceable.

Instead he felt something almost like satisfaction.

The Chronicles were gone. But Photine and Melaina lived. Demos lived. The Enclave had escaped systematic persecution. Knowledge had been converted into survival and the equation actually balanced for once.

Preservation had finally meant something beyond static hoarding.

Cornelius closed his eyes and allowed himself to feel the peace of that realization.

---

Morning arrived with the civic bells marking sixth hour.

Cornelius had spent the night in his roost organizing mental inventory of remaining collection and calculating optimal resource allocation for Temple fund replacement. By dawn he had comprehensive plan for liquidating additional manuscripts to restore emergency medical reserves without significantly compromising historical reference capacity.

The mathematics were functional. The solution was practical. He felt appropriately satisfied with strategic planning.

Imelda arrived at seventh bell carrying her customary documentation folder and wearing expression that suggested she already knew everything that had occurred and was prepared to manage consequences with characteristic competence.

"The Temple sent preliminary accounting request," she said without preamble. "They want verification of book sale proceeds and reconciliation of charity donation funds against current medical supply expenditures."

"I can provide complete documentation." Cornelius descended from his roost. "The transactions were properly recorded despite unconventional circumstances."

"I assumed as much. You are pathologically organized even when committing crimes." Imelda set her folder on the main desk. "The Founder's Chronicles. You actually sold it."

"Strategic resource allocation required liquidation of high-value assets."

"You loved that manuscript."

"I valued it. Past tense. Now I value what it purchased more than what it represented." Cornelius moved to the shelf where the Chronicles had sat. The gap remained obvious and painful. "Hoarding does not equal preservation. I am beginning to understand that distinction."

Imelda watched him with the steady attention that characterized her assessment of damaged things. "You are growing up. After only one hundred and twenty-seven years."

"Delayed moral development remains superior to permanent moral stagnation."

"True." She opened her folder and removed several papers. "The Temple will accept replacement funds over the next quarter. I negotiated payment schedule that allows you to liquidate additional manuscripts gradually rather than conducting emergency sales at disadvantageous prices."

"Thank you. That demonstrates excellent financial planning."

"I have been managing your hoarding tendencies for eighty years. I know exactly which items you will actually part with versus which ones you will protect irrationally." Imelda made a notation on one document. "I prepared list of secondary manuscripts that can be sold without compromising core collection integrity."

Cornelius accepted the list and reviewed it carefully. The selections were logical. High-value items that existed in multiple institutional copies. Important but not irreplaceable. Exactly what he would have chosen himself if emotional attachment had not clouded judgment.

"This is acceptable," he said.

"I know." Imelda returned the papers to her folder. "Brother Demos sent message this morning. He is recovering adequately. The Temple administration has accepted his preliminary incident report regarding the Vault withdrawal. They are launching standard investigation but expect it will conclude that procedural protocols were followed even if medical justification was questionable."

"Bureaucratic mercy preserving institutional stability."

"Exactly." Imelda moved toward the door. "I am going to the Temple to finalize accounting reconciliation. You should rest. You look exhausted."

"Dragons do not become exhausted. We experience temporary reduction in optimal performance capacity."

"Exhausted," Imelda repeated. "Rest. That is direct instruction from your supervisor."

She departed before Cornelius could protest the characterization.

Silence settled over the library. Cornelius remained beside the shelf where the Chronicles had been. The gap seemed slightly less painful now. More like indication of necessary expense rather than permanent loss.

He moved to his private study—the small room behind the main archives where he kept personal items separate from public collection.

On his desk sat a stack of fresh paper. Good quality. Properly cut. Waiting for documentation.

Cornelius had maintained detailed journals for one hundred and twelve years. Complete records of library operations, collection development, and civic disputes. Thousands of pages documenting everything he considered significant enough to preserve.

He had never once written about choices that required sacrificing treasured possessions for people.

He had never documented what preservation actually meant beyond static hoarding.

He had never recorded the specific weight of deciding that some things were worth spending rather than keeping.

Cornelius selected a clean sheet. Retrieved his favorite pen—the one with proper weight and comfortable grip. Positioned himself at the desk with everything aligned correctly.

Then he began to write.

*Case Documentation: The Petrification of Brother Demos and Related Events*

*Day One: Sister Photine Kallistos reported the discovery of Brother Demos in complete petrification within the Temple Archives. Initial investigation suggested hostile magical assault. Subsequent evidence indicated more complicated circumstances involving...*

He paused. Considered the official story versus actual truth. Decided that this journal was private record rather than civic documentation.

*...involving a mother's desperate attempt to save her daughter from degenerative magical disease using experimental preservation techniques. The procedure succeeded. Complications arose. Brother Demos was accidentally affected by residual magic. Sister Photine made the calculated decision to prioritize her daughter's extraction over immediate reversal of Demos's condition.*

*I condemned that choice initially. Viewed it as abandonment. Classified it as medical negligence approaching murder.*

*I was wrong.*

*The choice was triage. Impossible mathematics forced by systems that criminalize mothers for protecting children. Photine saved who she could save and accepted that the equation would never balance perfectly.*

*I spent three days learning to make similar choices.*

Cornelius continued writing. He documented the investigation with complete honesty. The clues discovered. The deductions made. The moment he realized Melaina was Photine's daughter and what that meant under current genealogical law.

He wrote about burning the birth record. About selling the Chronicles. About standing in the Vault and offering Photine gold with no conditions except saving Demos first.

He wrote about watching the Constant Stanza sail away carrying refugees toward cities that did not prosecute mothers for acknowledging their children.

He wrote about Captain Theo accepting obviously fabricated fever root allergy explanation because some truths were more important than official accuracy.

When he finished, dawn had shifted to full morning. His hand ached from sustained writing. The pages covered his desk in organized documentation of everything that mattered.

Cornelius read through the account once. Made minor corrections to factual details. Added footnote about the specific scent of sandalwood and its association with Photine's preservation magic.

Then he filed the pages carefully in his personal archive.

Private record. Not for civic documentation. Just his own understanding of what had occurred and why it mattered.

The library door chimed. Cornelius emerged from his study to find Yiayia Despina entering with her customary basket and determined expression.

"I heard you sold the Founder's Chronicles," she announced. "To help the Temple with medical supplies."

"News travels efficiently through civic networks."

"Cassius told me. Who heard from Marcus Varen. Who heard from the collector who bought it." Yiayia settled into her preferred reading chair. "That was a good thing you did. Foolish maybe. But good."

"Foolish and good are not mutually exclusive categories."

"No. Usually they go together." She opened her basket and removed a cloth-wrapped package. "I brought you something. Payment for good deeds."

Cornelius approached cautiously. "I do not require payment."

"It is not payment. It is gratitude." Yiayia unwrapped the cloth to reveal fresh mint leaves bundled with careful precision. "From my garden. The good kind. Not the wild stuff."

The scent reached Cornelius immediately—sharp and clean and exactly perfect. His mouth began watering with involuntary response.

"This is acceptable gratitude," he managed.

"I thought it might be." Yiayia rewrapped the mint and set it on the desk. "The Temple will recover. The Enclave got away safely. Brother Demos is healing. Sister Photine and her daughter are beyond civic reach. Everyone who should have survived did survive."

"Not everyone. Some patients were lost before we understood the scope of the crisis."

"Some. Not all." Yiayia looked at him with eyes that had witnessed eighty-three years of civic complications. "That is the best anyone can do. Save who you can save. Let the rest go. Try again tomorrow."

Cornelius thought about equations that never balanced perfectly. About preservation that required spending treasured things. About hoarding versus actually protecting what mattered.

"Yes," he said quietly. "I am learning that lesson."

"Good. Learn it properly this time. You are old enough that delayed education is getting embarrassing." Yiayia stood up and collected her basket. "I will return tomorrow for regular reading hours. Try not to commit any additional crimes before then."

"I make no promises regarding future criminal activity."

"Honest answer. I appreciate that." She moved toward the exit. "Enjoy the mint, Library Dragon. You earned it."

After she departed, Cornelius remained beside the desk staring at the wrapped mint leaves.

The library was quiet around him. Properly organized. Adequately maintained. Missing one irreplaceable manuscript but functionally intact.

His hoard was smaller.

His conscience was clearer.

The mathematics balanced better than they had in one hundred and twenty-seven years.

Cornelius carefully unwrapped the mint and selected a single perfect leaf. He placed it on his tongue and closed his eyes while the flavor spread bright and sharp across his senses.

Outside, the city continued its usual patterns. Temple bells marking hours. Market crowds generating commerce noise. Civic life proceeding with characteristic human chaos.

Inside the library, a dragon who had spent more than a century hoarding knowledge sat in peaceful silence and understood—finally, definitively—that true preservation sometimes required letting treasured things go.

The mint tasted perfect.

The equation balanced.

Everything that should have survived had survived.

And tomorrow he would begin again with collections slightly diminished but purposes significantly clarified.

Preservation was not the same as hoarding.

Knowledge was meant to be spent when spending it saved lives.

And some losses were acceptable prices for ensuring the right things continued existing.

Cornelius finished the mint leaf and returned to his roost.

The empty space on the shelf remained visible.

He decided it could stay that way.

A permanent reminder of what mattered more than perfect collections.

A gap that meant something survived that otherwise would not have.

A price paid that actually purchased something worth preserving.

The library settled into comfortable silence around him.

And for the first time in longer than he cared to calculate, Cornelius felt genuinely satisfied with strategic resource allocation decisions.

The game was finished.

The preservation was complete.

The story could rest.
