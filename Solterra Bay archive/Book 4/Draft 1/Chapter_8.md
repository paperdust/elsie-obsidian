# Chapter 8

The ledger was a disaster.

Cornelius adjusted his spectacles for the fourth time in as many minutes and resisted the urge to set fire to the entire document. Brother Demos's handwriting had apparently been shaped by the belief that legibility was optional and organizational systems were suggestions rather than requirements.

The ledger sat open on the reading table in his private study—a small stone room adjacent to the main archive floor where Cornelius maintained his personal research materials and what Zeph persistently referred to as his "secondary hoard." The afternoon light from the high windows illuminated the pages without providing any additional clarity to Demos's chaotic record-keeping.

Numbers ran sideways up margins. Abbreviations appeared without legend or explanation. Entire sections were written in what might have been personal shorthand or possibly the linguistic equivalent of a fever dream.

Cornelius had successfully stolen the ledger from Temple storage along with sufficient medical supplies to treat Melaina for at least a week. The theft had been distressingly simple—the Temple's administrative offices remained focused on organizing the charity book sale while Photine managed the infirmary alone. He had entered through the western storage access, located the medical supply inventory, appropriated what he required, and departed without encountering anyone more authoritative than a distracted acolyte who had assumed Cornelius possessed official authorization based purely on his civic position and species-based intimidation factor.

Criminal enterprise, it appeared, rewarded confidence and the strategic deployment of institutional assumptions.

But the ledger itself was proving far more resistant to interpretation than locked doors had been to theft.

Cornelius turned another page and encountered a section that appeared to document patient visits through a system of symbols rather than names. A circle with three lines meant something. A triangle with a dot represented something else. Whether these corresponded to species, illness categories, or Demos's personal mood remained frustratingly unclear.

He was attempting to decode what might have been either "house call to G.Q." or "hostile crab to G.Q." when Imelda entered the study carrying two cups of tea and the particular expression that suggested she had been observing his frustration for several minutes before intervening.

"You have been staring at that ledger for three hours," she said. She set one cup beside his workspace and claimed the reading chair near the window. "Have you eaten?"

"Eating is not a forensic priority."

"Eating is a biological requirement. Even for dragons who believe they can subsist entirely on stubbornness and mint." She sipped her tea. "I have bread and cheese in my office if you require sustenance."

Cornelius did require sustenance. He had not eaten since early morning and his concentration was suffering accordingly. But admitting this would validate Imelda's maternal oversight tendencies.

He ignored the tea and returned his attention to the ledger. "Demos apparently believed that proper accounting procedures were negotiable. This section appears to track expenditures through a combination of abbreviated locations, partial names, and symbols that may represent either species categories or possibly weather conditions."

"He was a healer, not an accountant."

"He was a healer managing Temple finances. Basic organizational competence should have been mandatory." Cornelius traced one entry with his claw-tip. "Look at this. 'Three cases F.R. to G.Q. via D.M.' What does that mean? Cases of what? G.Q. could be Gorgon Quarter or possibly Guild Quarters. D.M. might be a person or an abbreviation for delivery method."

Imelda leaned forward to examine the entry. "F.R. is probably Fever Root. The Temple uses abbreviated names for common medicines to save space in inventory records."

Cornelius blinked. "How do you know that?"

"Because I served on the Temple donation committee for fifteen years before you hatched. I am familiar with their administrative systems." She pointed to another entry. "B.S. is likely Boneset. W.B. is Willow Bark. These are standard medical abbreviations."

The pattern suddenly resolved into clarity. Cornelius turned back several pages and reviewed earlier entries with this new interpretive framework. "So this entire section documents medicine distribution. Fever Root to Gorgon Quarter delivered via... D.M. Direct method? Door-to-door?"

"Demos himself." Imelda's voice had gone quiet. "D.M. probably stands for Demos. He was hand-delivering medicines."

Cornelius worked backward through the entries, applying the medical abbreviation structure and the delivery-method hypothesis. The pattern emerged with devastating precision.

Demos had been tracking unauthorized medical distributions. Not just occasional charity cases but systematic, sustained treatment of patients who could not afford standard Temple fees. The entries dated back at least eight months and showed consistent, escalating commitment.

Three cases of Fever Root to the Gorgon Quarter.

Five units of Boneset to the dock workers' tenements.

Two cases of bandage supplies to the leatherworkers' guild.

All delivered personally. All provided without charge. All drawn from Temple inventory without official authorization or cost recovery.

"He was treating everyone," Cornelius said. "Everyone the Temple's triage system excluded or deprioritized. He was running a complete parallel medical network."

"Yes." Imelda set down her tea. "Which explains why the Temple approached bankruptcy. They were purchasing supplies at full cost and distributing them freely through Demos's charity operation."

Cornelius turned to the financial summary pages near the ledger's end. The numbers were more comprehensible than the treatment logs—simple accounting rendered in neat columns. Income versus expenditure. Donations versus supply costs.

The gap between them widened with each passing month.

The Temple had been spending approximately forty percent more on medical supplies than their donation income supported. The deficit had been growing steadily for nearly a year.

"Photine said Demos was bankrupting the clinic," Cornelius murmured. "She was not exaggerating. He was spending resources faster than the Temple could acquire them."

"He was saving lives the Temple's official policies excluded." Imelda's tone carried no judgment. Simply statement of fact. "Someone always bears the cost of mercy. Usually the person providing it."

Cornelius thought of his own book donations. The rare volumes he had finally contributed after hearing about the Temple's resource crisis. How he had framed it as temporary necessity rather than acknowledging the permanent loss.

How he had resented being asked to help at all.

While Demos had been quietly destroying his professional standing and compromising his institution's financial stability to ensure that sick children received treatment regardless of their families' ability to pay.

The shame was a physical sensation, settling in his chest like ballast.

He turned another page and found himself looking at a section titled simply "Special Cases." The handwriting here was neater, more careful. These entries mattered differently.

Patient M: Progressive petrification. Symptoms consistent with degenerative Gorgon condition. Standard treatments ineffective. Consulted with Mother Ligeia. Attempting experimental protocols.

Patient M appeared repeatedly across subsequent pages. Treatment notes. Medication adjustments. Observations about symptom progression.

Melaina.

Demos had been treating her for at least two months. Trying everything available within Temple resources and several things that were probably not officially sanctioned. The entries showed increasing frustration mixed with determined experimentation.

The final entry regarding Patient M was dated two days before Demos's petrification:

Secured S.Q.S. from emergency reserves. If this does not stabilize the condition, we may need to consider Temple leadership involvement despite risks to patient safety and family reputation.

S.Q.S.

Cornelius scanned backward through the ledger looking for the abbreviation's prior use. He found it in the inventory section—a separate log tracking Temple supply reserves.

Sandalwood Quarantine Soap.

The notation appeared in multiple places, always marked as restricted inventory. Expensive. Regulated. Reserved for containment protocol during infectious outbreaks.

Ten cases logged into storage six months ago.

Ten cases signed out three weeks ago.

Signed out to P.K.

Cornelius went very still.

P.K.

Not Demos.

He checked the signature authentication marks beside the entry. The handwriting was different from Demos's chaotic scrawl. More controlled. Tighter loops on the letters.

Someone else had withdrawn the Sandalwood Quarantine Soap from emergency reserves.

Someone with authorization to access restricted inventory.

Someone whose initials were P.K.

Photine Kallistos.

Cornelius's mind raced through connections. Sandalwood at the crime scene. Sandalwood on Melaina when Niko brought her to the library. Photine's violent reaction when he had mentioned sandalwood preservation in the infirmary.

The contamination terror. The obsessive cleaning. The bleeding hands.

She had taken the quarantine supplies. Not for outbreak containment. For something else.

For someone.

Cornelius reviewed the timeline. The soap requisition dated to three weeks ago. Demos's notes about Patient M showed treatments continuing until two days before his petrification. The specialized soap appeared nowhere in his treatment protocols for Melaina.

Which meant Photine had withdrawn expensive, regulated supplies for purposes unrelated to Demos's documented patient care.

For purposes she was desperate to conceal.

The study door opened. Cornelius looked up and found Zeph standing in the entrance, slightly out of breath.

"Someone's here to see you," Zeph said. "One of the Gorgon Enclave kids. She says Mother Ligeia sent her with a message."

Cornelius closed the ledger carefully. "Bring her to the consultation room. I will meet her there."

Zeph disappeared. Cornelius heard his footsteps retreating down the corridor, accompanied by quieter steps that suggested their visitor moved with considerable caution.

Imelda stood and collected both tea cups. "You should eat something before conducting additional interrogations."

"I am not interrogating. I am receiving information."

"You are going to interrogate that information until it confesses something useful." She moved toward the door. "I will bring bread. Try not to terrify the messenger while I am gone."

She departed before Cornelius could formulate appropriate denial.

He gathered the ledger and his notes and made his way to the consultation room—a small chamber near the library's main entrance designed for patron research assistance and reference interviews. The space contained a reading table, several chairs, and excellent acoustics for private conversation.

The messenger was young. Perhaps thirteen or fourteen. Her serpent hair coiled nervously around her shoulders and she stood near the door rather than claiming one of the chairs. She carried a folded paper sealed with what appeared to be wax from a candle rather than formal sealing compound.

"Cornelius Drake?" Her voice was quiet but steady. "Mother Ligeia sent this. She said to deliver it directly to you and no one else."

Cornelius accepted the message. "Thank you. Does Mother Ligeia require a response?"

"She said you would understand what to do after reading it." The girl glanced toward the corridor. "I should go. The Watch is enforcing curfew for—for our people. I need to get back before they start asking questions."

"Be careful."

She nodded and fled with the particular contained panic of someone navigating hostile territory.

Cornelius waited until her footsteps faded before breaking the seal and unfolding the message.

The handwriting was precise despite being written without visual reference. Ligeia's serpent hair could apparently guide her hand with remarkable accuracy.

*The Flower is wilting. Tell the Healer. She knows what must be done but fears the cost. Remind her that some flowers require difficult transplanting to survive.*

Cornelius read the message three times.

The Flower.

Melaina.

Except Ligeia believed Melaina was safely hidden in Cornelius's archive. She had confirmed as much during their conversation in the cisterns. She knew Niko had brought the girl to the library.

So why would she send a message saying the Flower was wilting?

Unless there was another Flower.

Another patient. Another person requiring protection and specialized care.

*Tell the Healer.*

Not "tell the Temple." Not "tell Photine."

The Healer.

Someone Ligeia trusted. Someone she believed would understand what needed to be done.

Cornelius thought of Photine's terror in the infirmary. Her obsessive fear of contamination. Her frantic scrubbing of spilled medicine while her hands bled.

Her withdrawal of ten cases of Sandalwood Quarantine Soap for unauthorized purposes.

*She knows what must be done but fears the cost.*

What cost would terrify a competent healer badly enough to cause psychological breakdown?

What would require quarantine supplies and secret treatment?

What would connect to Demos's investigation of fever patterns and his final notes about "Temple leadership involvement despite risks to patient safety and family reputation"?

Cornelius returned to his study and retrieved the ledger. He opened it to the inventory section and examined the Sandalwood Quarantine Soap entry more carefully.

Ten cases signed out to P.K. three weeks ago.

Each case contained approximately twenty bars of specialized soap according to Temple standard packaging.

Two hundred bars of quarantine-grade sandalwood soap.

Enough to maintain isolation protocol for a single patient for approximately six months.

Or to preserve medicines for transport to multiple patients over shorter periods.

Cornelius thought of the sandalwood scent at the crime scene. On Melaina. In Photine's treatment supplies.

A preservative agent. Standard for transported medicines in Demos's charity network.

But also a quarantine requirement.

Required for containment of infectious illness.

The pattern assembled itself with terrible clarity.

Photine was treating someone in isolation. Someone whose condition required quarantine protocol and complete secrecy. Someone whose illness connected to the fever cases Demos had been investigating.

Someone whose exposure would create "risks to patient safety and family reputation."

Family reputation.

Photine Kallistos.

A healer from one of the Three Families. A professional whose standing depended on maintaining institutional authority and social position.

What would destroy that reputation?

What would require hiding rather than treating through official Temple channels?

*The Flower is wilting.*

Not Melaina.

Someone else.

Someone Photine was protecting at the cost of her professional integrity, Temple resources, and apparently her psychological stability.

Cornelius set down the ledger and stared at the message.

He needed to speak with Photine. Directly. Without Watch presence or Temple administration interference.

He needed to understand what she was hiding and whether it connected to Demos's petrification.

But first, he needed to address his own moral accounting.

Cornelius rose and crossed to the collection vault—the climate-controlled storage chamber where the library's most valuable and fragile materials resided. He had installed additional security measures here beyond the standard civic protections. Temperature regulation. Humidity control. Restricted access.

His actual hoard, in the truest draconic sense.

The *Chronicles of the Founding* occupied a dedicated shelf near the vault's center. Twelve volumes bound in treated leather, the pages hand-scribed by the city's original record-keepers. Maps. Treaties. Architectural plans. Genealogies.

The complete documented history of Solterra Bay's establishment and early governance.

Irreplaceable. Comprehensive. Permanent knowledge that could not be replicated or reconstructed if lost.

Worth approximately two hundred gold in private sale to the right collector.

Enough to fund Temple medical operations for three months if allocated efficiently.

Cornelius lifted the first volume and felt its familiar weight. The leather had developed a particular texture from decades of careful handling. The pages smelled of preservation oils and historical significance.

He had been hoarding this collection for forty years. Maintaining it. Protecting it from donation requests and civic redistribution mandates.

Preserving it.

While Demos had been spending himself into institutional collapse to ensure sick children received treatment.

Cornelius carried the volume to his preparation table and began wrapping it in protective cloth. His movements were methodical. Careful. Each fold precise and secure.

Imelda entered carrying a plate of bread and cheese. She stopped when she saw what he was doing.

"The *Chronicles*," she said quietly.

"I am preparing it for private sale. I have a contact among the Doukas family archivists who has expressed interest in acquiring historical materials for their personal collection." Cornelius continued wrapping. "The sale should yield sufficient funds to sustain Temple operations through winter if Photine manages resources with reasonable efficiency."

"That is your most valued possession."

"That is a book. Demos was a person." He secured the wrapping with careful knots. "Apparently I require repeated instruction regarding relative value assessment."

Imelda set down the plate and moved closer. She placed one ink-stained hand on the wrapped volume. "This is genuine sacrifice. Not obligation performed under pressure. You are choosing this."

"I am choosing to stop hoarding while people die of preventable illness. The moral complexity is minimal." He stepped back from the table. "I will arrange the sale tomorrow and transfer the funds directly to Temple accounts with specifications that they be allocated toward medical supplies rather than administrative costs."

"Cornelius." Imelda's voice carried the particular weight that indicated she was speaking as his mother rather than his supervisor. "You understand that this changes nothing regarding Demos's condition. The money will help future patients but it cannot reverse his petrification."

"I understand. I am not attempting to purchase redemption or retroactive moral standing." He adjusted his spectacles. "I am simply allocating resources toward the community need with greatest impact potential. Practical resource management rather than emotional gesture."

"You are lying to yourself about your own motivations."

"Probably. But the outcome remains beneficial regardless of my psychological self-deception." He moved toward the door. "I need to visit Photine. Tonight. After the Temple closes for evening services."

"That is a terrible idea."

"That is an investigative necessity. Ligeia's message implies Photine is concealing information critical to understanding Demos's assault." He paused in the doorway. "And possibly to identifying additional patients suffering from whatever condition is affecting Melaina."

Imelda's expression shifted toward concern. "You believe there is an outbreak."

"I believe Demos was investigating fever patterns. I believe Photine withdrew quarantine supplies for unauthorized purposes. I believe both of them recognized a threat they were attempting to manage without Temple leadership involvement." He looked back at the wrapped *Chronicles*. "And I believe whatever they were trying to prevent has already begun."

The silence stretched between them. Beyond the study walls, the library conducted its ordinary evening operations. Patrons browsing shelves. Zeph probably avoiding actual work while appearing productively busy.

Normal civic function maintained while crisis developed in shadows.

"Be careful," Imelda said finally. "Photine is not stable. And cornered people make dangerous choices."

"I am aware. I will exercise appropriate caution."

He left Imelda in the study and returned to his private archive. Melaina remained where he had left her—curled in the corner on a nest of spare cushions Zeph had assembled, sleeping while Niko maintained watch from a reading chair.

The shapeshifter looked up when Cornelius entered. "Any news?"

"Possibly. How is she?"

"Same. Fever has not gotten worse but it has not improved." Niko's expression showed worry that suggested genuine attachment rather than simple duty. "The medicines you brought are helping with pain management but not addressing the underlying condition."

Cornelius approached and examined Melaina without waking her. Her breathing remained steady but shallow. Her skin temperature was elevated. The faint scent of sandalwood clung to her clothes and hair.

Quarantine soap.

Someone had been washing her with quarantine protocol supplies.

Someone had been maintaining isolation procedures while attempting treatment.

Someone who feared contamination spreading beyond containment.

*The Flower is wilting. Tell the Healer.*

Two flowers. Two patients. One quarantine supply chain.

Whatever illness was affecting Melaina, Photine was treating someone else with the same condition.

Someone whose reputation required absolute secrecy.

Family reputation.

Cornelius turned to Niko. "When Mother Ligeia directed you to bring Melaina here, did she mention why? Specifically why the library rather than maintaining concealment in the Enclave?"

Niko hesitated. "She said the Enclave was not safe. That someone was looking for Melaina and they could not protect her properly while managing the roundup situation."

"Who was looking for her?"

"She did not say. Just that it was safer to move her before questions started being asked."

Before questions connected Melaina to Demos's treatment network.

Before investigation revealed the fever patterns and quarantine protocols.

Before someone discovered that Brother Demos had been managing two critically ill Gorgon patients through unauthorized charity care while Sister Photine provided quarantine supplies without Temple authorization.

The structure was there. The connections visible.

He simply needed confirmation.

And that required confronting Photine directly.

Cornelius left instructions with Niko regarding Melaina's care and returned to the main library floor. The evening shift had begun—Imelda managing the circulation desk while Zeph reshelved returns with his characteristic creative interpretation of proper sorting methodology.

Cornelius bypassed them both and climbed to his roost in the library's dome. The city spread below him, the civic quarter's organized stone giving way to the more chaotic residential neighborhoods and eventually the docks.

Somewhere in that layered architecture, people were sick with something the Temple's healers could not cure.

Somewhere, Photine was maintaining secret quarantine protocols while managing institutional collapse.

Somewhere, the truth waited to be excavated from fear and desperate concealment.

Cornelius adjusted his spectacles and watched the Temple's lights begin their evening dimming sequence.

Soon, he would have answers.

He was not certain he would appreciate what those answers revealed.
