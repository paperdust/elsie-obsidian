# Chapter 2

"Do not touch anything."

Cornelius landed on the Archive threshold and folded his wings with precise movements, buying himself three additional seconds to process what lay before him. The delay did not help. Brother Demos remained exactly as impossible as he had appeared from the air: a statue where a person should be, grey stone where flesh had been, stillness where life belonged.

"I have not moved since I sent for you." Imelda stood near the far wall, her hands clasped so tightly her knuckles had gone white. "I found him like this when I came to retrieve the medical texts you requested for cataloging."

Cornelius approached the statue slowly, claws clicking against the Archive's tile floor. The sound echoed wrong in the enclosed space, too sharp and solitary. The Archives were always quiet—they occupied the oldest section of the Temple, where thick stone walls muffled the sounds of the clinic above—but this silence had weight to it. Presence.

The statue that had been Demos stood beside one of the record shelves, one hand extended toward a leather-bound ledger. The position suggested he had been reaching for the volume when the petrification occurred. His expression was not one of fear or pain, but of mild concentration, as though he had been mentally reviewing which page he needed.

He looked peaceful. That somehow made it worse.

Cornelius circled the figure, forcing himself into the methodical observation pattern he used for damaged manuscripts. Assess. Catalog. Understand.

The stone was uniform grey, the color of river clay after firing. No visible cracks or flaws marred the surface. The texture appeared smooth, almost ceramic, though Cornelius did not yet trust himself to touch it. The clothing had been transformed along with the flesh—robes, sandals, even the leather bag slung across Demos's shoulder had become stone, their folds and creases preserved with uncomfortable accuracy.

"How long has he been like this?" Cornelius kept his voice level, professional. A problem to be solved. Nothing more.

"I do not know. I last saw him yesterday evening, just after sunset. He mentioned needing to file the week's clinic reports." Imelda moved closer but maintained her distance from the statue, as though proximity might be contagious. "He would have come here directly. The filing system is his responsibility."

Cornelius examined the floor around the statue's base. No scuff marks. No sign of struggle. The tiles were dusty—the Archives were cleaned monthly rather than daily, as few people had cause to visit—but the dust appeared undisturbed except for Imelda's footprints leading from the door to her current position.

"No one else has been in here since you found him?"

"No. I locked the door immediately and sent for you." Imelda's voice carried the careful control of someone refusing to panic through sheer force of will. "Sister Photine is with a patient in the upper clinic. I have not yet informed her."

Cornelius nodded slowly, still circling. Petrification was not common, but it was documented. Gorgons possessed the ability as both defensive mechanism and, occasionally, attack. The transformation could be reversed if addressed quickly enough. The key question was how quickly.

He stopped in front of the statue and steeled himself. "I need to touch it."

"Are you certain that is safe?"

"No." Cornelius extended one claw and placed it gently against the statue's shoulder.

Stone. Definitely stone. Cool to the touch, with the slight texture of fired clay. Not marble—that would be smoother. Not granite—that would be rougher. Something in between, something that had been organic and was now decidedly not.

He pressed slightly harder, testing for give. None. The shoulder was as solid as the floor beneath his feet.

But—

Cornelius moved his claw to the statue's neck, just below the jaw, where a pulse would be if this were still a living body. He held very still, filtering out the background sounds: Imelda's breathing, his own heartbeat, the distant murmur of clinic activity from above.

There.

Faint. Impossibly faint. But present.

A vibration. Not a pulse exactly, but a tremor, as though something deep within the stone was still moving. Still trying.

"He is alive." Cornelius withdrew his claw and checked the observation from two other points—wrist and temple. The same subtle vibration in each location. "The petrification is not complete. His body is attempting to maintain biological function despite the transformation."

"Then he can be restored?"

"Possibly. Probably." Cornelius sat back on his haunches, calculating. "The literature on Gorgon petrification is frustratingly sparse, but the consensus among reliable sources suggests a window of reversibility. If the transformation can be undone before the biological processes fully cease, the victim returns to flesh largely unharmed."

"How long is the window?"

"Seventy-two hours from the moment of petrification." Cornelius looked at the statue's extended hand, still reaching for the ledger. "After that, the stone becomes permanent. The vibration stops. What remains is simply statue."

Imelda closed her eyes briefly. "Three days."

"Less than that now. If he was transformed last night—" Cornelius examined the ledger Demos had been reaching for. It lay on the shelf exactly where it belonged, undisturbed. "What time did you find him?"

"Just after the morning bell. Perhaps two hours ago."

"Then we have between fifty-eight and seventy hours, depending on the precise moment of transformation." Cornelius pulled his spectacles from his leather satchel and settled them onto his snout, though they would do nothing to improve his understanding of the situation. They simply felt correct. "The question is whether we can locate a Gorgon capable of reversal and willing to perform it."

"Captain Theo will need to be informed."

"Captain Theo will immediately blame the nearest Gorgon and arrest them without evidence." Cornelius moved to examine the shelf nearest the statue. "Which will be counterproductive if we need Gorgon cooperation to restore Demos."

"The law requires we report—"

"I am not suggesting we hide a body, Imelda. I am suggesting we gather information before we invite Theo to impose his traditional approach to investigation."

He ran one claw along the shelf edge, checking for disturbances. The dust here was thicker, marked only by the faint outline where Demos's hand had brushed against it while reaching for the ledger. No other marks. No sign anyone else had touched this shelf recently.

Cornelius pulled the ledger Demos had been reaching for and opened it carefully. Birth records. The most recent entries dated back three weeks. Names, parentage, attending healer. All in Demos's precise handwriting.

Nothing that would obviously motivate murder.

Though calling this murder felt premature. Petrification could be accidental—a Gorgon startled into reflexive defense, eye contact made without intent. It could be assault—a deliberate attack meant to harm but not kill. It could be something else entirely.

Cornelius closed the ledger and returned it to the shelf. He was examining the next volume when he caught the scent.

Faint. Nearly buried under the Archive's base notes of old paper and dried lavender. But present.

Sandalwood.

He moved closer to the statue, following the scent. Stronger near the statue's left side, near the leather bag transformed to stone against Demos's hip.

Sandalwood was not a medical scent. The Temple used lavender for calming, mint for clarity, alcohol for sterilization. Sandalwood belonged to personal perfumes or decorative incense, neither of which were part of Temple routine.

Cornelius committed the detail to memory and stepped back.

The door rattled. A fist pounded against wood. "Imelda! Open this door immediately!"

Imelda and Cornelius exchanged a look.

"Captain Theo," they said in unison.

Imelda moved to unlock the door. Cornelius positioned himself between the entrance and the statue, wings slightly spread. Not blocking access—that would be futile—but establishing that he was present and observing.

The door swung open. Captain Theo entered with the controlled urgency of a man accustomed to crime scenes, followed by two City Watch guards. He stopped three steps into the Archive, his gaze locking onto the statue.

"Fates preserve us." Theo's voice dropped to something between prayer and curse. "How long?"

"Since last night, we believe." Imelda closed the door behind the guards. "I found him this morning when I came to retrieve texts for the library."

"And you waited to inform the Watch because—?" Theo turned to her, eyebrows raised.

"Because I informed Cornelius first. His expertise in petrification reversal seemed more immediately relevant than your expertise in arresting people."

Theo's jaw tightened, but he moved to examine the statue rather than engage in argument. He circled it once, his expression hardening with each step.

"Gorgon," he said flatly. "Has to be. No other species can do this."

"Accurate but insufficient." Cornelius kept his tone academic, removing emotion from the analysis. "Saying a Gorgon did this is like saying a human wrote a threatening letter. Technically correct but not particularly useful for identifying which specific individual committed the act."

"There are protocols for this."

"There are protocols for murder. This is not yet murder."

Theo turned to face him. "That is a statue where my town's junior healer used to be. What would you call it?"

"Assault. Possibly accidental transformation. Definitely reversible within the seventy-two hour window, assuming we locate the individual responsible and convince them to undo it." Cornelius gestured toward the statue with one wing. "He is still alive in there. Barely, but measurably. Which means our priority should be restoration, not revenge."

"Restoration requires knowing who did this."

"Agreed. Which is why I have been examining the scene rather than jumping to convenient conclusions."

One of the guards shifted uncomfortably. Theo shot him a quelling look before returning his attention to Cornelius. "What have you found?"

"No signs of struggle. No disturbance beyond Imelda's entrance this morning. Demos was reaching for a birth ledger when the transformation occurred, suggesting he was engaged in routine work rather than confrontation." Cornelius paused. "And there is a scent of sandalwood near the body. Faint but present."

"Sandalwood?" Theo frowned. "The Temple does not use sandalwood."

"Precisely."

"Could be from perfume. Personal scent."

"Demos does not wear perfume." Imelda spoke with the certainty of someone who had worked alongside the healer for years. "He considers it unprofessional in a medical setting."

The door opened again. Sister Photine entered, her grey robes whispering against the floor. She stopped when she saw the cluster of people around the statue, her face draining of what little color it held.

"No." The word came out small. Broken. "No, not—"

She crossed the space in four strides and reached for the statue. Cornelius moved to intercept, catching her wrist gently in one claw.

"Do not touch him yet. We do not know if contact might cause further harm."

Photine stared at the statue, her breathing shallow. "How long has he—when did this—"

"Sometime last night," Imelda said softly. "I found him this morning."

"He is still alive." Cornelius kept his grip light but firm. "There is a seventy-two hour window for reversal. We have time."

"Time." Photine's voice held something beyond grief. That same terror Cornelius had noted in the square, now given concrete shape. She looked at Theo. "You need to lock down the Gorgon quarter."

Theo straightened. "I was about to suggest exactly that."

"No." Cornelius released Photine's wrist but moved between her and Theo. "Absolutely not. Antagonizing the entire Gorgon community will not help us identify the specific individual responsible."

"One of them did this." Photine's hands shook as she gestured toward the statue. "One of them came into our Temple and turned our healer to stone. You want me to trust that they will simply cooperate?"

"I want you to recognize that collective punishment will guarantee they do not cooperate." Cornelius kept his voice level despite the tension vibrating through his scales. "If you treat every Gorgon as a suspect, none of them will help you. And you need their help. Reversal requires the original Gorgon's participation. Arrest the wrong person and Demos stays stone."

"He is right." Imelda moved to stand beside Cornelius. "The lockdown will create more problems than it solves."

Theo crossed his arms. "Then what do you suggest? We ask politely if anyone happened to petrify our healer and could they please undo it?"

"We investigate properly." Cornelius gestured toward the statue. "We determine who had access to the Archives last night. We identify who uses sandalwood. We establish motive. Then we make an arrest based on evidence rather than species."

"This is not an academic exercise, Drake. We have less than three days."

"Which is why we should not waste time arresting random Gorgons in hopes one of them is guilty."

Photine pressed her hands to her face, breathing hard. "It is happening again. Just like before. Just like—" She cut herself off, shaking her head.

Cornelius filed that detail away. *Again.* This was not the first time Photine had experienced something like this. The fear from the square suddenly had context, though the specifics remained unclear.

Theo watched Photine's distress, his expression softening slightly. "Sister, I understand this is difficult, but we need to act decisively—"

"Decisively does not mean recklessly." Imelda's voice carried the authority of someone accustomed to ending arguments through sheer certainty. "Cornelius is correct. We investigate first. Then we arrest."

"And while we investigate, the Gorgon responsible could flee."

"Or they could be standing in this room right now, listening to you plan to arrest them for something they did not do." Cornelius met Theo's gaze steadily. "Gorgons are not interchangeable. They are individuals. Treat them as such."

Theo's jaw worked. Behind him, the two guards maintained careful neutrality, their faces revealing nothing.

Finally, Theo exhaled. "Fine. We investigate first. But I am posting guards at the Archive entrance and the Temple perimeter. No one enters or leaves without documentation."

"Acceptable."

"And I want a list of every Gorgon who had access to the Temple in the last week."

Cornelius's tail twitched. "That information exists in the visitor logs and patient records. I will compile it."

"You will?"

"I am a librarian. I catalog things. This is simply cataloging on a deadline."

Photine lowered her hands, her eyes red but dry. "I keep the patient records in my office. You may access them whenever you need." She looked back at the statue. "Can I—is it safe to touch him now?"

Cornelius considered. "Brief contact should be harmless. I would avoid sustained pressure or attempting to move him."

She approached the statue slowly, reaching out to touch the stone face. Her fingers traced the line of Demos's jaw, gentle as handling porcelain.

"I told him to go home," she whispered. "Last night. He was exhausted, and I told him the filing could wait until morning." Her hand dropped. "If he had listened, he would still—"

"If he had listened, you might have been the one working late in the Archives." Cornelius kept his tone matter-of-fact, refusing to let sentiment cloud logic. "Guilt is not productive. Focus on restoration."

Photine nodded without looking at him. "Seventy-two hours."

"Less now. Perhaps sixty."

"Then we should stop wasting time." She turned to face Theo and Cornelius, her fear crystallizing into something harder. "Find them. Find whoever did this and bring them to me. I will not lose another—" Again, she stopped herself. "Just find them."

She left, her footsteps quick and sharp against the tiles.

Theo watched her go, frowning. "She is hiding something."

"She is terrified," Cornelius corrected. "There is a difference."

"Terror usually has a source."

"Questions for later. Right now, we have a more immediate problem." Cornelius moved back to the statue, examining the extended hand once more. "I need to determine the precise moment of transformation to calculate our remaining time accurately. That requires more information about Demos's schedule and movements last night."

"I will handle witness interviews." Theo gestured to his guards. "You two, station yourselves outside the Archive door. No one enters without my authorization."

The guards moved to comply. Theo paused in the doorway, looking back at Cornelius. "For what it is worth, Drake—I hope you are right. I hope this is something we can solve carefully." He touched the doorframe. "But if we run out of time, I will arrest every Gorgon in the quarter if that is what it takes to save him."

"If we run out of time, arresting people will accomplish nothing except satisfying your need to punish someone."

"Perhaps. But at least I will have tried everything."

Theo left, his boots echoing down the corridor.

Imelda waited until the sound faded before speaking. "He means well."

"Meaning well is insufficient when dealing with complex problems." Cornelius adjusted his spectacles and returned his attention to the statue. "Though I suppose meaning well is better than meaning ill."

"High praise from you."

Cornelius ignored the dry observation. He leaned closer to the statue's shoulder, where the sandalwood scent was strongest. Not perfume—perfume would be lighter, more diffuse. This was concentrated. Deliberate.

Oil, perhaps. Or incense recently burned, the scent clinging to clothing.

He pulled a small notebook from his satchel and began recording observations. Time of discovery. Physical state of the statue. Presence of sandalwood. Photine's reaction. Theo's assumptions.

The pencil scratched against paper, filling the Archive's silence with purposeful sound.

"What are you thinking?" Imelda asked quietly.

"I am thinking," Cornelius said, not looking up from his notes, "that whoever did this took considerable care to make it look careless. The positioning suggests accident—Demos was working normally, transformation occurred suddenly. But the sandalwood suggests premeditation. Planning." He tapped the pencil against the notebook. "And I am thinking that Photine's fear existed before this morning. She was already expecting something terrible."

"You noticed that in the square yesterday."

"Yes. Which means this attack—if it is an attack—fits into a larger pattern she recognizes." Cornelius closed the notebook and looked at the statue. "The question is whether that pattern involves Gorgons, or whether Gorgons are convenient scapegoats for something else entirely."

Somewhere above them, the Temple bell rang, marking the hour. Time continuing its steady march toward the seventy-two hour threshold.

Cornelius spread his wings and moved toward the door. "I need to examine the visitor logs and patient records. You should return to the library and secure any texts on Petrification reversal we possess."

"Where will you start?"

"With the assumption that nothing here is accidental." Cornelius paused in the doorway, looking back at the statue one final time. "Demos was not random. The Archives were not random. And the sandalwood was definitely not random."

He left Imelda standing guard and climbed toward the Temple's upper levels where the administrative records were kept. His mind was already sorting possibilities into categories, building frameworks of logic around the central question:

Who would turn a healer to stone, and why would they want everyone to blame the Gorgons?

The answer, he was certain, would not be simple.

But then, the best mysteries never were.
