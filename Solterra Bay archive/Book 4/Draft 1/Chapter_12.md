# Chapter 12

The Temple dormitories smelled of lavender soap and antiseptic solution—familiar scents from Cornelius's previous visits to question Photine, but somehow sharper in the pre-dawn quiet. The halls stretched narrow and utilitarian, doors evenly spaced along whitewashed stone walls designed for function rather than comfort.

Cornelius moved quickly despite his size, claws muffled against worn floor tiles. Behind him, Zeph matched his pace with the particular care of someone attempting stealth while uncertain of the proper technique.

"Are we sure this counts as investigation rather than breaking and entering?" Zeph's whisper carried more volume than actual whispers required.

"We are not breaking anything. We are entering a space temporarily abandoned by its primary occupant for purposes of locating time-sensitive medical information." Cornelius paused at a junction, orienting himself. "Photine's quarters are in the senior healers' wing. Third door past the supply closet."

"That is definitely breaking and entering."

"The door will not be locked. Temple policy requires healers to remain accessible during emergencies. Therefore we are simply accessing a publicly available space during an emergency." Cornelius turned down the correct corridor. "The distinction is legally significant even if ethically questionable."

"You are using a lot of words to say we are committing crimes."

"I am using precise language to clarify that our actions fall into a gray area of civic regulation rather than explicit criminality." Cornelius stopped at the appropriate door—plain wood, unmarked except for a small brass nameplate reading **P. Kallistos, Senior Healer**. "Which becomes relevant if Captain Theo discovers our presence and demands legal justification."

Zeph made a sound suggesting he found this logic unconvincing but lacked energy to argue further. "Just open the door before I lose my nerve."

Cornelius tested the latch. Unlocked, as expected. The mechanism clicked softly and the door swung inward on hinges that had been recently oiled—no squeak, no resistance.

The room beyond was stripped nearly bare.

Cornelius entered slowly, his analytical oversight cataloging details with the same methodical precision he applied to damaged manuscripts. The space measured approximately twelve feet by fifteen. A narrow bed occupied the far wall, its mattress still present but linens removed. A writing desk sat beneath the room's single window, surface empty except for a thin layer of dust. A wardrobe stood open, interior shelves visible and vacant.

No personal items. No clothing. No papers or books or the accumulated debris of daily habitation.

She had cleared the space systematically.

"She is gone." Zeph moved to the wardrobe and peered inside as though Photine might be hiding behind the empty shelves. "Completely gone. This looks like nobody has lived here in weeks."

"This looks like someone removed all portable possessions within the last twelve hours." Cornelius approached the desk and examined the dust pattern. "Note the outline where a lamp sat. The dust accumulation is minimal—perhaps six to eight hours. She left after transforming Melaina and Niko but before dawn."

"How do you know she did not leave days ago?"

"Because the window latch shows recent operation." Cornelius gestured toward the brass mechanism. "Oil residue here, at the joint. Fresh. She opened this window within the last day, possibly to air the room before departure."

Zeph circled the small space, opening drawers that slid out empty, checking beneath the bed where nothing but dust collected against the wall. "She took everything. We are not going to find anything useful."

"People attempting rapid departure often overlook details. Particularly when managing psychological stress." Cornelius moved to the small hearth set into the exterior wall. Temple regulations required individual heating in senior quarters, and Photine appeared to have used hers recently.

The grate held ash. Not the cold, settled ash of fires long-extinguished, but the particular grey-white powder that indicated recent combustion.

Cornelius knelt and examined the residue without disturbing it. Paper ash. He could identify the substance by texture and the faint pattern of individual page-burns layering atop each other.

She had burned documents before leaving.

"Zeph. I need you to search the wardrobe more carefully. Check for false backs or hidden compartments."

"Why would she have hidden compartments?"

"Because she has been conducting unauthorized medical procedures and likely maintained records she could not store in official Temple files." Cornelius extended one claw and very carefully began sifting through the ash. "People who keep secrets develop systems for protecting those secrets. Search thoroughly."

Behind him, Zeph began tapping the wardrobe's interior walls with the particular rhythm of someone checking for hollow spaces. Cornelius filtered the ash particles, looking for incompletely burned fragments that might retain legible text.

Most of the material had been thoroughly destroyed. Photine had apparently fed pages gradually into the fire rather than dumping everything at once—a methodical approach that ensured complete combustion.

But paper burned unevenly. Corners survived. Fragments protected by surrounding material sometimes escaped the flames.

Cornelius's claw-tip encountered something with more substance than powder. He extracted it carefully—a triangular scrap approximately one inch per side, edges charred black but center portion still bearing ink.

The handwriting was Photine's. He recognized her precise, vertical script from the medical reports he had reviewed in the Temple Archives.

The visible text read: **...passage confirmed for six (6) passengers...**

Cornelius sat back on his haunches, the fragment resting carefully on his palm.

Six passengers.

Not one person fleeing. Not Photine escaping alone.

Six individuals traveling together.

"Found something." Zeph's voice carried the particular brightness that indicated actual discovery rather than speculation. "There is a space behind the back panel. Narrow. Maybe three inches deep."

"What is inside?"

"Nothing now. But the dust pattern shows something was stored here until recently. Rectangular. Maybe the size of a book or a flat box." Zeph emerged from the wardrobe. "You think she was hiding medical records here?"

"I think she was hiding something she needed regular access to but could not risk Temple administration discovering." Cornelius returned his attention to the ash, sifting more carefully. His claws encountered another fragment—this one slightly larger, perhaps two inches long.

The text read: **...Constant Stanza departs fifth bell, dock...**

Cornelius went very still.

Ship name. Departure time. Dock location.

Photine was not simply hiding within the city.

She was fleeing entirely.

Taking five other people with her.

His mind assembled possibilities with terrible speed. Six passengers. Mother Ligeia's message about "the Flower" and "the Healer." The Enclave's siege preparations and armed resistance. Photine's connection to the Kallistos family and her unauthorized treatment of Gorgon patients.

"She is evacuating Enclave leadership," Cornelius said quietly.

Zeph moved closer. "What?"

"Six passengers. Photine plus five others. Mother Ligeia. Possibly Xanthe. Possibly other Enclave organizers." Cornelius stood, the fragments cradled carefully in his palm. "They are abandoning the city before Watch enforcement escalates to violence."

"Wait. You think Mother Ligeia is leaving? She founded the Enclave. She has lived here for decades."

"She has lived here while maintaining community safety and autonomy. The registration protocols eliminate autonomy. The Watch's increasing aggression threatens safety." Cornelius moved to the desk and set the fragments down carefully. "She is protecting her people by removing leadership before they can be arrested or killed."

"But—" Zeph's voice caught. "If they leave, what happens to the Gorgons who stay? The ones who cannot afford to flee or do not have connections to get passage?"

The question hung between them.

Cornelius had no comforting answer.

Abandoning vulnerable populations to institutional violence was not noble.

But ensuring leadership survived to potentially organize future resistance or provide refuge elsewhere might be the only pragmatic option when facing overwhelming force.

He thought of Demos's ledger. The systematic documentation of charity work that bankrupted the Temple. The final entry about securing restricted supplies despite risks.

Sometimes preservation required accepting partial loss rather than total destruction.

"They are making the same calculation Photine made with Melaina," Cornelius said. "Preserve what can be preserved. Transform the salvageable. Accept that complete salvation is impossible with available resources."

"That is horrible."

"That is triage." Cornelius returned to the hearth and continued sifting ash. "Which does not mean we accept it as inevitable. It means we understand the constraints Photine is operating within."

His claw encountered a third fragment. This one was smaller—barely legible. But the visible text made his scales prickle.

**...payment rendered, no questions...**

Smuggler terms.

The *Constant Stanza* was not a legitimate passenger vessel.

It was a ship that transported people without documentation, without manifests, without official records that Watch investigations could trace.

Expensive. Dangerous. The sort of passage desperate people purchased when legal options ceased existing.

"She paid a smuggler." Cornelius set the fragment with the others. "Premium rate for priority boarding and absolute discretion."

"How much would that cost? For six people?"

"More than a Temple healer's salary accumulates. Significantly more." Cornelius stood and moved to the window. Beyond the glass, the city continued its pre-dawn routines. Watch bells marking patrol rotations. Distant market preparations. Normal civic function proceeding while people transformed to stone and community leaders fled prosecution.

The Kallistos family had money.

Photine could have accessed family resources if she convinced them the expenditure was necessary.

Or if she blackmailed them with threats to expose family secrets.

Cornelius thought of Kyra's furtive visits to Photine. Of Demos's notes mentioning "family reputation" as a risk factor. Of Mother Ligeia's pointed comments about selling one's reflection.

What secret was worth bankrupting family accounts to protect?

What truth threatened the Kallistos name badly enough that they would fund an illegal evacuation rather than face exposure?

"We need to find that ship before it departs." Zeph had moved to stand beside the desk, looking at the assembled fragments. "If we can stop Photine from leaving, we can convince her to reverse Demos's petrification."

"If we stop her from leaving, Captain Theo will arrest her for multiple murders and she will be detained before she can perform reversals." Cornelius turned from the window. "We need to intercept her before she boards but after she has evaded Watch detection. Which requires knowing exactly when and where the *Constant Stanza* docks."

"The fragment says fifth bell. That's dawn watch-change. About forty minutes from now."

"Which provides insufficient time to search all dock facilities for an unlisted smuggler vessel." Cornelius moved back to the hearth and resumed searching the ash. "I need more information. Dock number. Specific berth. Something that narrows the location."

He sifted carefully, claw-tips separating powder from potential fragments. Most of the material had burned completely. Photine had been thorough.

But paper was stubborn. Ink sometimes survived. And people under psychological duress made mistakes even when attempting methodical destruction.

His claw encountered something with different texture than paper ash. Smoother. Slightly waxy.

He extracted it carefully.

Wax seal fragment. Dark blue. The partial impression of what might have been a ship or possibly a stylized bird.

"Zeph. What do you know about dock facilities and smuggler operations?"

"Literally nothing. I have never committed crimes before this week."

"What about general maritime logistics? Ship recognition? Harbor navigation?"

"I can identify that boats float. That is the extent of my nautical expertise." Zeph moved closer to examine the wax fragment. "What is that?"

"Seal from official correspondence. Possibly a smuggler captain's personal mark or a dock authority bribe-stamp." Cornelius held it up to catch lamplight. The impression was too incomplete to identify definitively, but the color and wax quality suggested expensive commissioning.

Professional criminal enterprise rather than desperate improvisation.

The *Constant Stanza* had infrastructure. Established systems. Probably regular routes and reliable discretion.

Which meant someone in the city knew how to contact them.

Someone who arranged illegal passage with enough frequency to maintain working relationships with smuggler captains.

Cornelius thought of the Enclave's hidden networks. Of Mother Ligeia's intelligence-gathering systems. Of the parallel healthcare and supply chains that operated beneath Temple and Watch awareness.

Of course the Enclave maintained smuggler contacts.

They would need evacuation options for people fleeing persecution or seeking medical treatment unavailable through official channels.

"We need to reach Mother Ligeia before Photine boards that ship," Cornelius said. "She arranged the passage. She will know the exact location."

"You said she was probably one of the six passengers. She might already be at the dock."

"Then we intercept them there and convince Photine that reversing Demos's petrification is more important than fleeing prosecution." Cornelius moved toward the door, the wax fragment secured carefully in his palm. "Either way, remaining in this room provides no additional information."

He reached for the door latch.

Footsteps echoed in the corridor outside.

Not the hurried pace of emergency response. Not the casual rhythm of routine patrol.

Measured. Deliberate. The particular cadence of someone approaching a specific destination with clear purpose.

Cornelius froze. Behind him, Zeph went completely still.

The footsteps stopped directly outside Photine's door.

Cornelius's mind calculated options rapidly. The window was too small for him to exit quickly. The wardrobe lacked sufficient space to conceal a dragon. Under the bed was undignified and likely ineffective.

They had no legitimate reason to be in this room.

The door latch clicked.

Cornelius grabbed Zeph and pulled them both behind the opening door with the same motion he used to shield fragile manuscripts from falling objects. The space was cramped—barely sufficient to conceal them if the room's occupant entered without conducting thorough searches.

The door swung inward.

Captain Theo entered.

Cornelius held absolutely still. His scales prickled with the particular discomfort of being caught mid-crime by the one person most capable of enforcing consequences.

But Theo did not search the room.

He moved directly to the desk.

His uniform looked rumpled—shirt untucked slightly, jacket unbuttoned. His face showed exhaustion that went beyond missed sleep into genuine emotional fatigue.

He stood at the desk for approximately fifteen seconds without moving. Just staring at the empty surface.

Then he reached into his jacket pocket and withdrew something small.

A wooden carving. Cornelius could not see details from his current angle, but the shape suggested a bird. Possibly a sparrow.

Theo placed it carefully on the desk's center.

His hand lingered there. Fingers spread across wood as though touching something precious through proxy.

"You did the right thing," he said quietly. "Whatever you did. Whatever you were protecting. It was the right thing."

His voice carried none of the professional authority Cornelius associated with Watch captains.

This was personal.

Intimate.

The tone someone used when speaking to absent loved ones.

Theo withdrew his hand and stood for another moment, looking at the carving. Then he turned and walked to the door.

Paused.

Looked back at the small wooden bird sitting alone on the empty desk.

"Come back safe," he said.

Then he left. The door closed behind him with a soft click.

His footsteps retreated down the corridor. Faded. Disappeared.

Cornelius waited until he could no longer detect any sound before moving from behind the door. He approached the desk slowly.

The carving was beautifully made. Detailed feather-work. Careful attention to proportions. The bird's head turned slightly as though listening for something just beyond hearing.

Not professionally commissioned. Hand-carved with the particular imperfections that indicated personal creation rather than purchased craft.

Theo had made this himself.

Had carried it to Photine's empty room.

Had left it as—what? Gift? Apology? Promise?

"He loves her," Zeph whispered. The words carried surprise and something softer. Understanding, perhaps. Or sympathy.

"He has clearly developed emotional attachment that compromises professional objectivity regarding her case." Cornelius examined the carving without touching it. "Which explains why he has not issued formal arrest warrants despite having sufficient evidence to justify detainment."

"That is the least romantic thing you could possibly say."

"I am not attempting romance. I am analyzing investigative implications." But Cornelius's voice lacked its usual certainty.

Because Theo had called what Photine did "the right thing."

Had told her to come back safe.

Had left a gift made with his own hands in her empty room where only desperate hope suggested she might return to find it.

Watch Captain Theo—who had threatened mass Gorgon arrests and enforced discriminatory registration—had also fallen in love with a healer who petrified patients and fled the city to protect them.

Humans were extraordinarily complicated.

"We should leave before he comes back," Zeph said.

"Agreed." Cornelius moved to the hearth and collected the burnt fragments, wrapping them carefully in a handkerchief from the desk drawer. "We have sufficient information to narrow search parameters. Fifth bell departure. Smuggler vessel. Six passengers including Photine and likely Mother Ligeia."

"And you think the Enclave leadership is abandoning everyone else."

"I think they are preserving organizational capacity against overwhelming institutional violence. Whether that constitutes abandonment or strategic retreat depends on whether they intend to establish safe refuge elsewhere or simply disappear." Cornelius moved toward the door. "Either way, we must reach them before that ship departs."

"And convince Photine to stay and reverse Demos's petrification even though that means Watch arrest and probable execution."

"Correct."

"While also somehow protecting her from Theo despite him being the Watch Captain and literally in charge of enforcement."

"Essentially accurate."

"That seems impossible."

Cornelius opened the door and checked the corridor. Empty. He gestured for Zeph to follow.

"It seems improbable," he corrected. "Impossible would require circumstances that preclude any potential solution. We have approximately thirty-five minutes before fifth bell. We have partial location data. We have new intelligence about Theo's compromised objectivity. We have motivation and—"

"New criminal charges," Zeph interrupted. "Breaking and entering. Evidence tampering. Probably a dozen other things."

"Minor additions to our existing violations." Cornelius moved quickly down the corridor toward the dormitory exit. "At this point we have already committed sufficient crimes that adding trespass charges makes minimal difference to eventual prosecution."

"That is not comforting."

"I am not attempting comfort. I am being realistic about our legal status." They reached the stairs and descended quickly. "Focus on priorities. Find Photine. Save Demos. Prevent Enclave leadership from fleeing. Address criminal charges after ensuring no one remains unnecessarily petrified."

They emerged into the Temple's pre-dawn quiet. The clinic wing showed lamplight in a few windows—night shift healers maintaining routine despite crisis.

Somewhere in the city, a smuggler vessel prepared for departure.

Somewhere in that vessel's plans, six passengers waited to disappear.

And somewhere inside failing stone, Brother Demos's biological functions continued degrading toward permanent death.

Cornelius spread his wings.

"The docks," he said. "Harbor district. We find that ship before fifth bell or everyone dies."

He launched himself into the air. Behind him, Zeph ran for the library to collect supplies.

Thirty-three minutes remained.

Human inefficiency was going to kill them all unless Cornelius located one specific unlisted vessel among dozens of legitimate ships in a harbor system designed for exactly the kind of anonymous traffic smugglers required.

He angled toward the waterfront and increased his speed.

The hunt had become a race.

And the clock was running out.
