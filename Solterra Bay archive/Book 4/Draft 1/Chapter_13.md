# Chapter 13

The concealed entrance to the Gorgon Enclave—a collapsed warehouse facade concealing stairs that descended into the old cistern network—stood unguarded.

Cornelius landed on the cracked paving stones and folded his wings with careful precision. The absence of sentries registered immediately as wrong. During his previous visit, armed Gorgons had challenged him before he reached the actual doorway. Security had been layered, deliberate, prepared for Watch incursion.

Now the threshold gaped empty.

Behind him, Zeph's running footsteps echoed through the pre-dawn quiet. The boy had retrieved supplies from the library and met Cornelius at the warehouse as planned—approximately seven minutes of their remaining time spent on coordination that might prove entirely unnecessary if the Enclave had already evacuated.

"Where are the guards?" Zeph bent forward, hands on knees, catching his breath.

"Excellent question. I am about to determine whether their absence indicates evacuation or ambush." Cornelius moved toward the entrance, scales prickling with the particular awareness that accompanied entering potentially hostile territory. "Remain behind me. If violence occurs, retreat immediately."

"You keep saying that like I would run toward danger instead of away from it."

"You have demonstrated concerning willingness to engage in confrontation despite being an unarmed human adolescent." Cornelius descended the stairs, claws clicking against stone worn smooth by decades of foot traffic. "I am merely establishing clear protocols for potential emergency scenarios."

The stairs curved downward into dimness. Lamps usually illuminated this passage every twenty feet—oil fixtures maintained by Enclave residents to guide safe navigation through the cistern network. Currently, most stood dark. Only every fourth lamp showed flame, and those burned low, wicks trimmed to minimal output.

Emergency lighting. The bare minimum required to prevent total darkness.

Cornelius's eyes adjusted easily—dragon vision functioned well in limited illumination. But the shadows felt wrong. Too many. Too deep. The cisterns had possessed specific acoustic character during his last visit—distant voices echoing through stone corridors, the particular resonance of occupied space.

Now he heard only his own claws and Zeph's careful footsteps.

Silence pressed against his eardrums with physical weight.

They reached the first junction where the entrance passage connected to the main cistern chamber. Cornelius paused at the threshold, extending his awareness outward through the sensory information available.

No cooking smoke. No voices. No movement except the faint drip of condensation from ceiling stones into standing pools.

He entered the main chamber slowly.

The Gorgon Enclave had occupied this space for decades, transforming ancient water storage into livable community infrastructure. During Cornelius's previous investigation, the cistern had bustled with activity—families preparing meals over small braziers, children playing in alcoves carved into the walls, artisans working at tables lit by carefully positioned lamps.

Now the chamber stretched vast and empty.

Cornelius moved deeper inside, his analytical assessment cataloging details with the same precision he applied to damaged manuscripts requiring restoration documentation.

The fires were not merely extinguished. They had been properly doused, coals scattered and cooled, ash swept into neat piles ready for disposal. Bedrolls had been removed entirely—not abandoned in hasty flight but packed systematically. Furniture remained, but lighter items were gone. The tables stood in organized rows, but no tools cluttered their surfaces. Shelves built into alcoves showed gaps where personal possessions had been removed with care.

This was not panicked evacuation.

This was methodical departure.

"They left." Zeph's voice echoed strangely in the empty space. "When? How did we not know?"

"Because Mother Ligeia is significantly more competent than I credited." Cornelius approached one of the alcove-shelves and examined the dust patterns. Light layer, perhaps two days' accumulation. "They began evacuating approximately forty-eight to seventy-two hours ago. Possibly longer for initial groups."

"But we saw them. Guard patrols. Xanthe preparing weapons. Ligeia talking about protecting people."

"We saw exactly what Ligeia intended us to see." Cornelius moved to another alcove, checking for overlooked items. "A small defensive presence maintaining visible occupation while the actual population departed in careful stages."

The realization assembled itself with terrible elegance. Cornelius had interpreted the Enclave's siege preparations as defensive fortification—armed guards, barricaded entrances, militant rhetoric about resisting Watch persecution. But those preparations had not been defense.

They had been theater.

Misdirection designed to focus Watch attention on the cisterns while actual evacuation proceeded elsewhere.

Zeph climbed onto one of the tables and sat with his legs dangling. "So where did everyone go? That many people cannot just disappear."

"They can if departures are staggered across multiple days using different routes through prearranged smuggler networks." Cornelius examined the main brazier area. "Ligeia has likely maintained evacuation contingencies for years. Underground passages connecting to harbor districts. Sympathetic ship captains willing to transport undocumented passengers. Safe houses in other cities."

"That would cost a fortune. How would they pay for it?"

Excellent question.

Cornelius thought of the burnt fragments from Photine's room. Six passengers at premium smuggler rates. The expensive dark blue wax seal suggesting established criminal infrastructure rather than desperate improvisation.

He thought of the Enclave's population during his previous visit. Hundreds of residents. Families. Elderly community members. Children too young for dangerous travel.

Evacuating that many people would require resources beyond anything standard Temple salaries or Enclave craftwork could accumulate.

"Community pooling," Cornelius said slowly. "Donations from Gorgons who escaped persecution in other cities and sent money back. Possibly Temple charity funds that Demos redirected. Ligeia has been planning this for months. Possibly years."

"Demos was helping fund this?" Zeph's voice rose. "He bankrupted the Temple to save Gorgons, and now they used that money to leave?"

"He bankrupted the Temple to provide medical care and survival resources to marginalized populations facing institutional violence. If some of those resources funded evacuation to safety, that aligns with his apparent priorities." Cornelius moved toward the deeper cistern passages, following the faint lamplight that marked continued navigation paths. "The question is whether Photine had access to those same funds for her own escape."

He already suspected the answer.

Demos had spent everything. The ledger had documented systematic resource depletion—medicines purchased, bandages distributed, house calls conducted without payment. Three months of charity work that drained Temple accounts to critical levels.

And Photine had covered for him. Had compensated where possible. Had hidden the spending from Temple administration while the financial crisis deepened.

She would not have simultaneously been building personal evacuation funds.

Which meant she was fleeing with whatever resources she could scrape together at the last moment.

Which meant she might not have enough to actually secure passage.

Cornelius stopped walking. The deduction settled with uncomfortable clarity.

Six passengers. The *Constant Stanza*. Fifth bell departure.

Professional smuggler operations charged premium rates for undocumented transport. Cornelius had no direct experience with illegal passage pricing, but basic economic logic suggested significant cost—particularly for priority departure during heightened Watch enforcement.

Photine was a Temple healer. Her salary provided comfortable living but not accumulated wealth. And she had just spent weeks secretly treating quarantined patients, burning through restricted supplies, petrifying people to preserve them against degenerative magical disease.

She possessed medical expertise.

She possessed desperate motivation.

She did not possess gold.

"We need to reach the docks immediately." Cornelius turned and moved back toward the exit with increased speed. "Photine will be unable to pay for passage. She will be stranded at the harbor while the *Constant Stanza* departs without her."

Zeph jumped down from the table and followed. "Wait. You think she does not have money? Then why burn those documents about the ship?"

"Because the documents connected her to illegal smuggler operations and potentially implicated Mother Ligeia's evacuation network. She destroyed evidence that could trigger Watch investigations into the broader refugee movement." Cornelius took the stairs upward two at a time. "But destroying evidence is separate from possessing adequate financing."

They emerged into the pre-dawn air. The city continued its mechanical routines—distant bells marking patrol rotations, early merchants beginning market preparations. Normal civic function while crisis accelerated beneath institutional awareness.

Cornelius spread his wings, then paused.

The problem was not simply reaching Photine.

The problem was providing resources she needed while operating under severe time constraints with no access to conventional banking or legitimate currency exchange.

He could not withdraw Temple funds—that required authorization he did not possess and time he did not have.

He could not access civic emergency reserves—those required Council approval.

He could steal gold from Watch evidence storage or Temple donation boxes, but theft required time for planning and execution that exceeded their remaining margin.

He needed liquid assets.

Immediately negotiable value.

Something he could convert to gold within minutes rather than hours.

Cornelius thought of his hoard. The rare volumes secreted throughout the library in hidden spaces designed for exactly this kind of resource preservation. Books were not instantly liquid—selling them properly required authentication, appraisal, auction arrangements.

But selling them improperly just required finding a buyer willing to pay immediately for obviously genuine rare editions without asking difficult questions about provenance.

The black market book trade operated in every major city. Collectors who acquired restricted texts through unofficial channels. Merchants who purchased estate liquidations without excessive documentation requirements.

Cornelius knew three such dealers in Solterra Bay's commercial district.

And he possessed one volume valuable enough to generate the gold Photine needed.

*The Chronicles of the Founding. First Edition. Complete with original illumination and the Founder's personal annotations.*

The centerpiece of his hoard. The text he had protected for decades against institutional demands and civic emergencies. The one book he had sworn never to sell regardless of circumstances.

The book worth enough to fund illegal passage for six people on a smuggler vessel with no manifest and no questions.

His scales prickled. The sensation was not the external warning of danger but rather internal conflict between his preservation instincts and his recent recognition that hoarding prevented rather than protected.

Demos had spent everything to save people.

Photine had destroyed her career to preserve dying patients.

Cornelius had spent weeks investigating their sacrifices while maintaining his own hoard against theoretical future need.

The parallel was uncomfortable.

And increasingly indefensible.

"Zeph." Cornelius turned to face his assistant. "I need you to go directly to the harbor district. Search for the *Constant Stanza*. It will be docked at a berth used for cargo rather than passenger vessels—smugglers avoid terminals with heavy Watch presence."

"What are you going to do?"

"I am going to convert assets to currency." Cornelius did not specify which assets. The admission would require explanation he lacked time to provide. "When you locate Photine, explain that I will arrive with the necessary gold before fifth bell. Do not let that ship depart until I reach the dock."

"How am I supposed to stop a ship?"

"Diplomatic negotiation. Physical obstruction if necessary." Cornelius knew this was asking a sixteen-year-old human to interfere with professional criminals, but alternatives were limited. "Use your judgment regarding appropriate intervention levels."

"That is the worst instruction you have ever given me."

"I am operating under severe time pressure and trusting your demonstrated capacity for creative problem-solving." Cornelius adjusted his spectacles. "Go. Now. We have approximately thirty-one minutes before fifth bell."

Zeph hesitated. "What if I cannot find the right ship? The harbor has dozens of vessels."

"Then we fail and Demos dies and Photine is arrested and Melaina remains stone permanently." Cornelius gestured toward the harbor district with one wing. "Which is why you are going to locate that ship and prevent its departure through whatever means prove necessary."

"No pressure then."

"Enormous pressure. But you have thus far demonstrated surprising competence despite your youth and species limitations." Cornelius spread his wings fully, preparing for flight. "I have confidence in your ability to accomplish objectives when properly motivated by impending disaster."

"Again—not comforting."

"Comfort is not the priority. Success is the priority. Go."

Zeph went—running toward the harbor with the particular speed of someone operating on adrenaline and desperate hope.

Cornelius angled toward the commercial district and launched himself upward. The pre-dawn sky showed the first traces of approaching sunrise—not visible light yet, but the particular quality of darkness that indicated imminent transition.

Fifth bell would ring when dawn watch change commenced. Approximately thirty minutes remained.

Not enough time to negotiate careful sale.

Not enough time to arrange proper appraisal.

Barely enough time to locate a dealer, present the book, accept whatever price they offered, and transport gold to the docks before the *Constant Stanza* departed.

Cornelius flew faster.

Below him, the city's architecture transitioned from residential districts to commercial zones. The commercial district woke earlier than other areas—merchants preparing inventory, bakers firing ovens, craftspeople beginning skilled work that required full daylight for precision.

And book dealers who maintained both legitimate storefronts and unofficial back-room operations for restricted texts acquired through questionable channels.

Cornelius descended toward a familiar building near the main market square. Three stories. Stone construction. Ground floor housed a respectable antiquarian bookshop. Upper floors contained private acquisition rooms where collectors examined rare editions away from public scrutiny.

He landed in the alley behind the building and folded his wings.

The back entrance was locked—expected at this hour. But Cornelius knew the proprietor lived above the shop, and book dealers who specialized in unofficial acquisitions maintained flexible hours for clients requiring discretion.

He knocked.

Waited.

Knocked again with increased force.

A window opened on the second floor. A man's face appeared—middle-aged, showing the particular annoyed expression of someone woken before intended.

"We are closed. Return during business hours."

"I have a first edition *Chronicles of the Founding* that requires immediate sale." Cornelius kept his voice level. "I can provide authentication and am willing to accept below-market pricing in exchange for instant gold payment."

The face disappeared. Cornelius heard footsteps descending interior stairs.

The door opened.

The dealer—a human named Marcus Varen who specialized in historical texts and had purchased several of Cornelius's less precious volumes during past library culls—stood wrapped in a dressing gown, holding a lamp.

"You have the *Chronicles*?" His expression shifted from annoyed to intensely interested. "The Founder's annotated copy? I thought that was in your permanent collection."

"It was. Now it requires conversion to portable currency." Cornelius did not enter despite the opened door. "I need gold. Immediately. Whatever rate you consider fair for emergency sale."

Marcus studied him for a long moment. "How much gold do we need to generate?"

Cornelius calculated rapidly. Six passengers at professional smuggler rates during heightened enforcement. No manifest fees. Priority departure. Absolute discretion.

"Three thousand standard weight." The number felt obscene. But smugglers charging wealthy clients for desperate circumstances would demand premium pricing. "Possibly four thousand to ensure coverage including unexpected fees."

Marcus whistled softly. "That is substantial liquidation. The *Chronicles* could bring that amount at proper auction with authentication time and collector bidding. But emergency sale with no provenance verification?" He paused. "I can offer two thousand immediately. Perhaps twenty-five hundred if I contact a collector I know who has been seeking that specific edition."

Two thousand was insufficient. Twenty-five hundred was marginal.

"Contact your collector," Cornelius said. "Tell them I am offering the genuine Founder's annotated *Chronicles*, complete original illumination, perfect condition, available for immediate cash purchase with no documentation or auction delays."

"They will want authentication."

"I will provide my personal certification as Library Dragon and include three reference texts that establish my expertise in manuscript verification. They can examine the volume here while I wait. But the entire transaction must complete within twenty minutes."

Marcus's expression suggested he found this timeline ambitious but not impossible. "Wait in the back room. I will send a runner and prepare verification materials."

He disappeared into the building. Cornelius heard rapid movement—footsteps, drawers opening, the particular sounds of urgent preparation.

Cornelius remained in the alley, unwilling to enter until necessary. His scales were doing the uncomfortable prickling thing that indicated internal conflict rather than external threat.

He was about to sell his most valued possession.

The book he had hoarded for decades.

The text that represented everything his preservation instinct protected—rare knowledge, irreplaceable historical documentation, beautiful craftsmanship, cultural heritage.

He was selling it to fund criminal activity by a fugitive healer who had broken multiple laws and petrified three people including a Temple junior healer currently dying inside unstable stone.

The logic should have made him reconsider.

Instead, it crystallized his certainty.

Demos had spent everything—his salary, his savings, his health, ultimately his biological integrity—to preserve lives the Temple's systems excluded.

Cornelius had spent decades accumulating books while congratulating himself for good stewardship.

One of them had actually preserved something that mattered.

The other had simply hoarded.

The distinction was becoming painfully clear.

Marcus returned to the doorway. "My runner is fetching the collector. They will arrive within fifteen minutes. Bring the book inside—we need to prepare authentication documentation."

Cornelius spread his wings. "I must retrieve it from the library first. I will return within seven minutes."

"Seven—that is barely enough time to fly there and back."

"Then I will fly quickly." Cornelius launched himself upward before Marcus could protest further.

The library rose in the distance—familiar stone dome, careful architecture, the physical representation of everything Cornelius had spent his life protecting. He descended through his private entrance window and moved directly to his study.

His hoard did not gather in one location. That would be poor security. Instead, precious volumes were distributed throughout the building in hidden spaces only Cornelius could access easily—behind false shelf-backs, under removable floor tiles, inside hollowed sections of decorative columns.

*The Chronicles of the Founding* occupied a climate-controlled compartment beneath his sleeping roost. The location was deliberately inconvenient to discourage casual access while maintaining optimal preservation environment.

Cornelius removed the floor panel and extracted the volume with careful claws.

Leather binding. Gold leaf still bright on the spine. Pages that smelled of aged parchment and expensive ink. The Founder's handwriting visible in margin notes throughout the text.

Beautiful.

Irreplaceable.

Worth less than Photine's freedom and Demos's survival.

He wrapped it carefully in protective cloth and secured it in a carrying satchel.

Then he flew back to Marcus Varen's shop and sold his hoard.
