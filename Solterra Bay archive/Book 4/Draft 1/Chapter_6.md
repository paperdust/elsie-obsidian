# Chapter 6

The Temple of Althaia occupied three full blocks in the civic quarter, its whitewashed walls reflecting morning light with aggressive brightness. Cornelius landed on the perimeter wall and folded his wings against the glare. The building's architecture prioritized visibility and cleanliness—wide windows, open courtyards, surfaces designed for easy scrubbing. Every tile gleamed. Every corner appeared recently inspected.

It made his scales itch.

He had managed to deflect Captain Theo's inspection through a combination of bureaucratic procedure and strategic misdirection. The Watch possessed authority to search public spaces, certainly, but the library's historical archives qualified as restricted civic property requiring Council authorization beyond simple Watch mandate. Cornelius had produced three separate municipal codes supporting this position while standing in the entrance doorway, physically blocking access to the stairs and radiating the particular stubbornness that came from one hundred twenty-seven years of defending territorial boundaries.

Theo had eventually retreated with poorly concealed frustration and a promise to return with proper authorization.

Which gave Cornelius approximately six hours before the Council convened for emergency session approval.

Six hours to investigate Photine, secure medical supplies, and determine whether the Head Healer was incompetent, complicit, or actively criminal.

He descended from the wall and entered through the main courtyard. The Temple's administrative entrance remained open despite the early hour—healing operated on continuous shifts rather than merchant schedules. A young acolyte looked up from the registry desk, his expression shifting through surprise, concern, and professional neutrality in rapid succession.

"Cornelius Drake, City Librarian," Cornelius announced. "I require access to Sister Photine regarding the ongoing investigation into Brother Demos's assault."

The acolyte consulted his records. "Sister Photine is currently managing the infirmary. I can send word—"

"That will not be necessary. I am familiar with Temple layout." Cornelius moved past the desk before the acolyte could formulate objection. The advantage of civic position and species-based intimidation: people rarely argued with a dragon claiming institutional authority.

The path to the infirmary took him through the Temple's eastern corridor, which opened onto the street-level market district through a series of arched alcoves. Vendors had begun morning setup—produce stalls, fabric merchants, the inevitable book dealer who operated from a wheeled cart and consistently undersold library donation sales.

Cornelius intended to walk past without engagement. He had investigation to conduct and crimes to commit. Browsing market stalls would constitute irresponsible time allocation.

Then he saw the book.

It sat on the dealer's display board, spine upward, the leather binding worn but intact. Even from fifteen feet away, Cornelius recognized the title stamped in faded gilt: *Thalassan Tide Tables and Coastal Survey, Fourth Edition*.

The continuation of the navigation treatise he had just donated.

The book dealer—a weathered human named Petros who had been operating this corner for at least thirty years—noticed Cornelius's attention and smiled. "Morning, Cornelius. Picked this up from an estate sale in the port district. Thought you might be interested. Only twenty silver."

Twenty silver for a text that would complete the coastal navigation collection. Twenty silver to restore what he had sacrificed for Temple medical supplies.

Twenty silver that could instead purchase medicine.

Cornelius approached the cart. The book appeared properly maintained despite its age. He could see the careful stitching along the spine, the edge-marking that indicated frequent but respectful use. A scholar's copy. Something preserved by someone who understood its value.

"The binding is intact?" Cornelius asked.

"Completely. Some margin notes in the appendices, but clean script. Probably a harbor master's reference copy." Petros lifted the book and opened it to demonstrate. "See? Beautiful condition for something this old."

It was beautiful. And it was exactly the kind of permanent knowledge Cornelius had built his entire professional philosophy around preserving.

Imelda's voice echoed in his memory: *"Permanent loss of knowledge is a tragedy. But so is permanent loss of people."*

Cornelius stepped back from the cart. "I appreciate the offer, but I must decline."

Petros's surprise was evident. "You sure? I can hold it for you if you need to check library funds—"

"I am certain. The library's resources are currently allocated toward more immediate community needs." Cornelius turned away before the temptation could reassert itself. "If it remains unsold in three months, inquire again."

He continued toward the infirmary before Petros could respond. Behind him, he heard the book dealer's quiet sound of confusion.

The permanent loss of that knowledge would indeed be a tragedy if someone else purchased it and removed it from the city entirely.

But people were more important than books.

He was still trying to convince himself of this when he entered the infirmary.

The space smelled aggressively of lavender and antiseptic alcohol—scents deployed to mask the underlying reality of illness and bodily distress. Rows of beds lined both walls, separated by thin curtains that provided minimal privacy. Perhaps two-thirds of the beds were occupied. Cornelius noted the patient distribution: primarily elderly or very young. The working-age adults who could afford private healers were absent.

Triage in architectural form.

Sister Photine stood at the central preparation table, organizing supplies with mechanical precision. She wore her grey healer robes, the fabric crisp despite the early hour. Her dark hair was pulled back in a braid so tight it looked painful. Her hands moved constantly—sorting bandages, counting vials, rearranging instruments into geometric patterns.

She did not look up when Cornelius entered.

"Sister Photine," Cornelius said. "I need to speak with you regarding Brother Demos."

"Speak, then." She continued sorting. Glass vials clinked against each other as she transferred them from storage box to preparation tray. "I am listening while working. We are understaffed."

Cornelius moved closer, observing her process. She was organizing fever treatments—the same medicines Demos had apparently been distributing during unauthorized house calls. The vials contained liquid in varying amber shades: boneset tincture, willow bark suspension, chamomile concentrate.

Standard remedies. Nothing exotic or suspicious.

"When did you last see Brother Demos?" Cornelius asked.

"Three days ago. Morning shift. He completed his filing duties and departed at sunset." Her hands never stilled. Pick up vial. Examine label. Place in tray. Repeat. "I assumed he went home."

"You did not verify?"

"I am not his keeper. I am his supervisor. There is a distinction." She finished one tray and immediately began another. "Demos was an adult who managed his own schedule outside clinic hours."

"Did he mention any plans? Any patients requiring follow-up treatment?"

"No."

The answer came too quickly. Cornelius's tail curled. "You are certain?"

"I am certain he did not mention plans to me. What he did independently is not my concern unless it compromised clinic operations." Photine's hands trembled slightly as she reached for another vial. "Which it did. Continuously. His unauthorized charity work depleted our supplies while providing no cost recovery. It was professionally irresponsible regardless of intent."

"You knew about the unauthorized treatments?"

"Of course I knew. Demos was exhausted, supplies vanished, and patients from the Gorgon quarter began referencing 'the kind healer who visits at night.'" She set down three vials with excessive force. "I am not incompetent."

"Yet you did not stop him."

Photine finally looked up. Her eyes were bloodshot, the skin beneath them dark enough to suggest she had not slept properly in days. "Stop him how? Report him to Temple leadership and guarantee his dismissal? Force him to refuse treatment to dying children? What solution would you recommend, Librarian?"

The title carried accusation rather than respect.

Cornelius adjusted his spectacles. "I would recommend honesty regarding resource constraints and collaborative problem-solving with Temple administration."

"Temple administration cares about donations and patron relationships. They care about maintaining reputation with the Three Families. They do not care about—" She stopped. Her jaw worked as though physically restraining further comment. "I did what I could. I managed supply allocation to compensate for Demos's distributions. I covered his absences. I maintained operational continuity."

"While the clinic approached financial collapse."

"Yes." She returned to organizing vials. "While the clinic approached financial collapse. Because the alternative was watching people die of preventable illness while sitting on a stockpile of medicine we were 'preserving' for paying patients."

The parallel to Cornelius's own book-hoarding was uncomfortably precise.

He tried a different approach. "Did Demos mention treating anyone specifically? Someone whose condition was unusual or resistant to standard remedies?"

Photine's hands stopped moving. Just for a moment. Then resumed with increased speed. "No."

She was lying.

Cornelius could not identify the specific tells—Photine's baseline anxiety was too high for standard deception analysis—but the timing was wrong. The pause too calculated.

"What about you?" Cornelius asked. "Have you personally treated any Gorgon patients recently? Anyone requiring house calls or supplies delivered outside standard clinic protocol?"

"I treat many patients." She was arranging the vials by height now, creating a precisely graduated sequence. "I do not catalogue them by species."

"I am asking about unconventional treatment locations. Specifically, treatments requiring sandalwood preservation for transported medicines."

This time, the reaction was unmistakable. Photine's entire body went rigid. Her hand, reaching for another vial, trembled so violently that she knocked the container sideways.

It fell.

Glass shattered against tile with a sound like a small explosion. Amber liquid spread across the floor in a puddle that caught the light from the high windows.

Photine stared at the spill. Her breathing had gone rapid and shallow.

Then she moved.

She swept the entire tray of vials into the waste bin with a motion so violent that at least three more containers shattered. Glass fragments scattered across the floor. The sharp scent of mixed tinctures rose in a cloud.

"Contaminated," Photine said. Her voice had gone flat. "All contaminated. Cannot use contaminated supplies. Patient safety requires—"

She grabbed a scrub brush from the cleaning station and dropped to her knees beside the spill. She began scrubbing the tiles with frantic intensity, the brush bristles catching on grout lines and spreading the liquid rather than containing it.

Cornelius stepped back, uncertain whether to intervene. "Sister Photine. The spill is minor. It does not require—"

"Contamination spreads." She scrubbed harder. Her knuckles were white with pressure. "Invisible. Microscopic. One drop transfers to hands, hands to face, face to mucous membranes. Standard sanitation protocol requires complete decontamination of affected surfaces and disposal of any materials within splash radius."

She was reciting textbook procedure while destroying the floor's grouting.

"You are damaging the tiles," Cornelius observed.

"Tiles can be replaced. Infection cannot be unspread." The brush slipped and scraped across her knuckle, drawing blood. She did not appear to notice. "Do you understand? Once it transfers, it continues. Patient to healer. Healer to family. Family to community. Geometric progression until containment becomes impossible."

"What infection?" Cornelius asked carefully.

Photine stopped scrubbing. She stared at the tiles, at her bleeding hands, at the chemical-stained grout.

"Fever," she said finally. "Just fever. Standard autumn illness. Nothing unusual. I am simply—we are understaffed. Demos is gone and I am managing alone and standards must be maintained—"

She resumed scrubbing with renewed violence.

Cornelius watched her destroy her hands against stone and chemicals. The obsessive cleaning. The terror of contamination. The specific mention of geometric progression and community spread.

This was not standard medical caution.

This was someone managing a crisis in complete isolation.

"How many patients have this fever?" Cornelius asked.

"I do not track patterns. I treat symptoms." Scrub. Scrub. Blood mixed with antiseptic and tincture. "Each patient is individual. Drawing broader conclusions requires epidemiological analysis we are not equipped to—"

"How many?"

Photine's hands stilled. She remained kneeling on the floor, surrounded by glass shards and chemical residue, her professional composure eroded into something raw and desperate.

"Enough," she whispered. "Enough that I notice. Enough that Demos noticed. Enough that we started comparing notes about symptoms and progression and treatment resistance." She looked up at Cornelius. "Enough that when he said he would investigate the connection, I told him to be careful."

"What connection?"

"I do not know. He would not specify. He said speculation without evidence was irresponsible." She laughed, a sound like breaking glass. "Professional to the end. Even when conducting unauthorized research into potential plague patterns."

The infirmary door opened. An elderly patient shuffled in, supported by what appeared to be a grandchild. Photine's expression transformed instantly—the mania smoothing into professional neutrality, the terror masked beneath practiced competence.

She stood, brushing glass fragments from her robes. "Excuse me. I have patients requiring treatment."

She walked toward the new arrivals, her bloody hands hidden in her sleeves, her voice gentle and reassuring as she guided them toward an empty bed.

The transformation was complete. The terrified, obsessive healer vanished behind the mask of calm institutional authority.

Cornelius remained beside the contaminated floor, processing implications.

Demos had been investigating fever patterns.

Melaina had unexplained progressive fever.

Photine was terrified of infection spread and had been treating patients with supplies preserved in sandalwood.

The same sandalwood found at the petrification scene.

Movement near the infirmary entrance caught his attention. A figure stood in the archway, partially obscured by the decorative column.

Cornelius adjusted his spectacles, sharpening focus.

Kyra Kallistos. Watching Photine with the intensity of someone conducting surveillance rather than seeking treatment.

Their eyes met across the infirmary. Kyra's expression remained neutral, but her posture shifted—weight transferring to her back foot, preparing for withdrawal.

Cornelius moved toward her. "Miss Kallistos. I did not expect to encounter you at the Temple this morning."

By the time he reached the archway, she was gone.

Cornelius stepped into the corridor. Empty. The morning market continued its operations beyond the arches, vendors calling prices and customers negotiating purchases. The normal commerce of a city conducting business while emergency governance organized roundups and investigations proceeded toward uncertain conclusions.

No sign of Kyra in any direction.

He returned to the infirmary entrance and looked back at Photine. She was examining the elderly patient now, her movements gentle and methodical, her voice too quiet for Cornelius to hear specific words. The perfect image of a dedicated healer managing routine treatment.

Except her hands were still bleeding through her sleeves.

And Kyra was tracking her movements.

And somewhere in Cornelius's hidden archive, a sick Gorgon girl carried the same sandalwood signature that marked the crime scene where Demos had been transformed to stone.

The patterns were there. Connections forming between fever and petrification, between Photine's terror and Demos's investigation, between the official Temple operations and whatever secret treatment network had been operating in shadows.

He simply could not yet see the complete structure.

Cornelius left the infirmary and returned to the main corridor. The Temple's supply storage occupied the western wing—a secured area requiring authorized access. Normally, such authorization was strictly controlled.

But currently, the Temple was understaffed, Photine was managing the infirmary alone, and the charity book sale had diverted administrative attention toward inventory and logistics.

Which meant Cornelius had approximately thirty minutes to locate, appropriate, and conceal enough medical supplies to treat a dying teenager while avoiding detection by an institution he was simultaneously investigating and robbing.

He adjusted his spectacles and reviewed his mental catalogue of Temple layout.

Sometimes preservation required theft.

He was still not entirely comfortable with this evolution of his moral framework.

But comfort, like certainty, was apparently a luxury he could no longer afford.
