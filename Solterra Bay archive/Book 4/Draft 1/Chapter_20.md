# Chapter 20

The Constant Stanza cleared the harbor entrance as the sun touched the western horizon.

Cornelius stood on the dock watching the ship's silhouette diminish against the darkening water. Behind him, Zeph shifted weight from foot to foot with the nervous energy that characterized adolescents forced to remain stationary during moments of significance.

"They made it," Zeph said quietly. "Photine and Melaina both. They actually made it."

"Maritime jurisdiction transfers once vessels pass beyond harbor limits." Cornelius tracked the ship's progress with the same focused attention he applied to cataloguing manuscript provenance. "Current distance places them firmly outside civic authority. Yes. They made it."

The dock smelled of brine and tar and the particular combination of fish and unwashed humanity that characterized working harbors. Cornelius found the olfactory assault profoundly unpleasant but remained committed to witnessing complete departure before returning to his properly organized library.

Zeph exhaled slowly. "I thought Theo would get here faster. I thought we would have to actually lie to his face instead of just watching the ship leave."

"Captain Theo's arrival timing was delayed by my earlier misinformation regarding dock location." Cornelius adjusted his spectacles with one claw. "I may have suggested the Constant Stanza was berthed at the commercial pier rather than the smuggler's quarter. Simple administrative error. Could happen to anyone."

"You lied to the Watch Captain."

"I provided inaccurate information based on incomplete dock manifests." Cornelius kept his attention on the departing ship. "The distinction is philosophically significant even if functionally irrelevant."

Zeph made a sound that indicated suppressed laughter. "You are getting very good at this."

"At what specifically?"

"Crime. You are getting very good at crime."

Before Cornelius could formulate appropriate response to that disturbingly accurate assessment, footsteps approached on the dock behind them. Multiple sets. Moving with the organized rhythm that indicated Watch patrol rather than casual pedestrian traffic.

"Library Dragon." Captain Theo's voice carried the particular exhaustion that indicated someone who had been running investigations for extended periods without adequate sleep. "I need to ask you some questions about events at the Temple of Althaia this evening."

Cornelius turned to face the Watch Captain. Theo stood flanked by four guards carrying torches that cast flickering illumination across the dock. His uniform was disheveled. His expression showed the specific tension that preceded difficult interrogations.

Behind the guards, Brother Demos leaned heavily against a dock post. He had clearly followed Theo from the Temple despite obvious physical distress. His skin still showed the grayish pallor that indicated recent magical trauma but his eyes were alert and focused.

"Captain." Cornelius adopted the formal neutral tone he employed during civic disputes. "I am happy to provide whatever assistance the Watch requires."

"The Temple Vault was accessed this evening using Senior Healer Photine Kallistos's authorization codes." Theo pulled a folded paper from his belt. "Emergency withdrawal. Two thousand crowns. Justified by supposed quarantine exposure requiring immediate medical intervention."

"I see." Cornelius remained perfectly still.

"However, when Temple administration attempted to verify the emergency, Senior Healer Photine could not be located. Archive records show you were present in the Temple this evening during the relevant timeframe." Theo's gaze moved to Zeph. "Both of you were documented entering the administrative wing approximately ninety minutes ago."

Zeph opened his mouth. Closed it. Looked at Cornelius with the specific panic that indicated someone who had no idea what to say during official interrogation.

"We were conducting archival research," Cornelius said calmly. "Brother Demos requested assistance locating historical medical records related to his current patient caseload. I provided standard reference services."

"Archival research." Theo's tone suggested significant skepticism. "In the Temple Vault. During a medical emergency."

"We were not in the Vault. We were in the public Archives reviewing birth ledgers and treatment protocols." Cornelius gestured toward Demos with one wing. "Brother Demos can confirm the nature of our research."

All attention shifted to Demos. He pushed away from the dock post with visible effort and moved to stand beside Cornelius.

"The Library Dragon is correct," Demos said. His voice was hoarse but steady. "I asked him to help me locate precedent documentation for unusual medical cases. He provided expert assistance navigating Temple archive organization. Which is—" He paused to cough wetly. "—which is extremely complicated and benefits from professional guidance."

Theo stared at Demos with the intensity that indicated visual assessment of physical condition. "You look terrible."

"Fever root allergy. Recent onset. Very unpleasant." Demos managed a weak smile. "I was exposed during patient treatment approximately three days ago. The reaction was severe enough to produce temporary petrification-like symptoms. Sister Photine reversed the effect this evening using standard antihistamine protocols. I am still recovering from the physiological stress."

The silence that followed carried weight that pressed against Cornelius's awareness like physical presence.

Captain Theo looked at Demos. At Cornelius. At Zeph. Back to Demos.

Then, very slowly, he folded the paper and returned it to his belt.

"Fever root allergy," he repeated.

"Yes. Apparently I have developed sensitivity to the concentrated extract. Sister Photine has recommended I avoid direct handling of undiluted preparations in future." Demos coughed again. "She documented the incident in her medical log before departing for—" He paused. "Before departing."

"Departing." Theo's voice had gone extremely flat. "Where exactly did Senior Healer Photine depart to?"

"I believe she mentioned needing rest after the emergency reversal procedure." Demos swayed slightly but remained upright. "The magical expenditure was significant. She was quite depleted."

"So you do not know her current location."

"No. I assumed she returned to her dormitory quarters."

Theo rubbed his face with both hands. The gesture suggested someone processing information that contradicted preferred conclusions.

"The Vault withdrawal," he said finally. "Two thousand crowns. For quarantine supplies."

"Emergency requisition." Demos nodded. "I authorized the withdrawal based on Sister Photine's medical assessment. She indicated potential exposure incident requiring immediate intervention supplies. I processed the paperwork according to standard protocols."

"What kind of exposure?"

"She did not specify details. Patient confidentiality restrictions." Demos met Theo's gaze directly. "I trusted her professional judgment. If the requisition was inappropriate, the administrative error is mine. I should have requested more detailed justification before approving emergency access."

Cornelius watched Captain Theo's expression shift through several configurations. Suspicion. Frustration. Something that looked disturbingly like relief.

"Fever root allergy," Theo said again.

"Very severe reaction." Demos gestured at his own appearance. "As you can observe."

"And the two thousand crowns."

"Emergency medical supplies. Properly documented through official channels. If there are concerns about procedural irregularities, I will submit full accounting to Temple administration for review." Demos paused. "Though I expect the investigation will take several weeks given current administrative backlog."

The corner of Theo's mouth twitched. Not quite a smile. Just the suggestion that he recognized the game being played and had decided not to interfere with its conclusion.

"Several weeks," he repeated.

"At minimum. Possibly longer if complications arise." Demos coughed one more time. "I really should return to the Temple infirmary. This recovery process is quite uncomfortable."

Theo looked past them toward the harbor entrance. The Constant Stanza was barely visible now—just a distant shape against darkening water.

"I was told Senior Healer Photine might be attempting to leave the city," he said quietly. "Unverified information. Probably unreliable."

"People say many things during investigations," Cornelius observed. "Much of it proves inaccurate upon proper verification."

"Yes. Much of it." Theo turned back to his guards. "The dock search is completed. No fugitives located. We are returning to the station."

The guards exchanged glances but followed orders without verbal protest. They formed up and began marching back toward the civic quarter with torches creating bobbing circles of illumination in the darkness.

Theo remained stationary for one additional moment. He looked at Demos with the same intensity from before—but the underlying emotion had shifted from suspicion to something that looked painfully like concern.

"Take care of yourself," he said. "Fever root allergies can be serious."

"I will be more careful in future." Demos managed another weak smile. "Thank you for your concern, Captain."

Theo nodded once. Then he turned and followed his patrol back toward the city proper.

Silence expanded on the dock. Cornelius counted his own heartbeats. One. Two. Three. Four.

Demos sat down abruptly on a cargo crate. "That was terrifying."

"You performed adequately under interrogation pressure." Cornelius moved to stand beside the crate. "The fever root allergy explanation was creative if medically questionable."

"It was the first thing I thought of that explained petrification symptoms without requiring actual Gorgon involvement." Demos leaned forward and put his head in his hands. "Also, I definitely have something wrong with my body because sitting down feels significantly better than standing."

Zeph approached cautiously. "Are you going to be okay?"

"Probably. Photine said the reversal was successful. I just need rest and normal food and time for my system to remember how biological processes work." Demos looked up. "She got away. Melaina got away. They are both safe."

"Yes," Cornelius confirmed. "Maritime jurisdiction. Beyond civic authority. Safe."

"Good. That is good." Demos closed his eyes. "Even if it means I now have to maintain a fictional fever root allergy indefinitely to explain why I was temporarily petrified."

"Bureaucratic mercy," Cornelius said. "Where official stories do not need to be true as long as they preserve institutional stability."

"I hate that I taught you that concept." Demos stood up slowly. "I am going back to the Temple. I need to submit preliminary incident reports before someone decides to conduct thorough investigation."

"Do you require assistance walking?"

"I will manage. The Temple is close and I have survived worse." Demos looked at Cornelius for a long moment. "Thank you. For everything. For the impossible things."

"You sold your burial plot to help people the system excluded." Cornelius adjusted his spectacles. "I sold a book. The mathematics favor your sacrifice significantly."

"The mathematics do not account for sentimental value." Demos gestured toward the library in the distance. "That manuscript meant something to you. Selling it cost you more than gold."

Cornelius felt something uncomfortable shift in his chest. "Preservation requires strategic resource allocation. Sometimes that includes spending treasured possessions rather than hoarding them indefinitely."

"Yes. Sometimes it does." Demos turned toward the city. "I will visit the library when this resolves. We should have tea and discuss our various criminal activities."

"I do not drink tea. However, I will tolerate your presence while you consume beverages in my reading room."

"High praise from a dragon." Demos managed a genuine smile this time. "Goodnight, Library Dragon. Goodnight, Zeph."

He walked away with careful steps that suggested someone whose body was not entirely reliable. His silhouette disappeared into the darkness beyond the dock.

Zeph exhaled slowly. "He is going to be okay."

"Probably. Photine is competent healer. The reversal procedure was successful." Cornelius spread his wings. "We should return to the library. I have been away from my collections for unacceptable duration."

"You have been committing crimes for three days. The books survived without you."

"The books always survive. That is their advantage over people." Cornelius crouched to allow Zeph to climb onto his back. "But I prefer to verify collection integrity personally rather than relying on architectural stability alone."

Zeph settled into position. "Do you think Theo knew? About Photine leaving?"

"Captain Theo accepted obviously questionable medical explanation for documented magical crime with minimal investigation." Cornelius launched himself upward. "Either he is significantly less competent than professional reputation suggests, or he deliberately chose not to pursue evidence that would require arresting someone he preferred to believe innocent."

"So yes. He knew."

"He suspected. He chose not to confirm suspicions. The distinction matters for official record even if practical outcome remains identical."

They flew over the city in comfortable silence. Below them, civic life continued with usual evening patterns. Lamps being lit. Doors being closed. The organized rhythm of civilization settling into night.

The library appeared ahead—familiar silhouette against darkening sky. Cornelius felt something in his chest relax at the sight of his territory properly secured and waiting.

He landed in the courtyard and Zeph dismounted quickly.

"I am going to sleep for approximately twelve hours," Zeph announced. "Possibly longer if nobody wakes me up for emergencies."

"Acceptable plan. I will manage morning operations independently." Cornelius moved toward the main entrance. "Thank you for your assistance during recent complications."

Zeph stopped. Turned. "Are you being nice to me?"

"I am acknowledging competent performance under difficult circumstances."

"You are definitely being nice. This is weird." Zeph grinned. "You are welcome. For helping you commit various crimes in the name of justice."

He disappeared into the library before Cornelius could formulate appropriate response to that characterization.

Cornelius remained in the courtyard for several additional minutes. The air had cooled significantly. His scales adjusted temperature automatically but he still felt the shift in environmental conditions.

Three days ago he had been hiding books to prevent their inclusion in charity donation.

Three days ago his primary concern had been preserving collection integrity above all other considerations.

Three days ago he had believed that hoarding knowledge was the same thing as protecting it.

The person occupying his body now felt like different creature entirely.

Cornelius spread his wings and launched himself upward one final time. He landed on his customary roost and settled into the familiar depression his body had worn into stone over decades of occupation.

The library stretched below him in organized perfection. Shelves aligned. Books properly secured. Environmental controls maintaining optimal preservation conditions.

Everything exactly as it should be.

Except.

His gaze found the specific shelf near the historical archives section. The shelf where the Founder's annotated Chronicles of the Founding had rested for one hundred and three years before this afternoon.

The gap was obvious. A space precisely the dimensions of that irreplaceable manuscript. Empty now. Converted to currency. Spent on human problems that required human solutions.

Cornelius stared at the absence for a long time.

He waited for the grief to arrive. The desperate regret. The overwhelming sense of loss that should accompany sacrificing something irreplaceable.

Instead he felt something almost like satisfaction.

The Chronicles were gone. But Photine and Melaina lived. Demos lived. The Enclave had escaped systematic persecution. Knowledge had been converted into survival and the equation actually balanced for once.

Preservation had finally meant something beyond static hoarding.

Cornelius closed his eyes and allowed himself to feel the peace of that realization.

---

Morning arrived with the civic bells marking sixth hour.

Cornelius had spent the night in his roost organizing mental inventory of remaining collection and calculating optimal resource allocation for Temple fund replacement. By dawn he had comprehensive plan for liquidating additional manuscripts to restore emergency medical reserves without significantly compromising historical reference capacity.

The mathematics were functional. The solution was practical. He felt appropriately satisfied with strategic planning.

Imelda arrived at seventh bell carrying her customary documentation folder and wearing expression that suggested she already knew everything that had occurred and was prepared to manage consequences with characteristic competence.

"The Temple sent preliminary accounting request," she said without preamble. "They want verification of book sale proceeds and reconciliation of charity donation funds against current medical supply expenditures."

"I can provide complete documentation." Cornelius descended from his roost. "The transactions were properly recorded despite unconventional circumstances."

"I assumed as much. You are pathologically organized even when committing crimes." Imelda set her folder on the main desk. "The Founder's Chronicles. You actually sold it."

"Strategic resource allocation required liquidation of high-value assets."

"You loved that manuscript."

"I valued it. Past tense. Now I value what it purchased more than what it represented." Cornelius moved to the shelf where the Chronicles had sat. The gap remained obvious and painful. "Hoarding does not equal preservation. I am beginning to understand that distinction."

Imelda watched him with the steady attention that characterized her assessment of damaged things. "You are growing up. After only one hundred and twenty-seven years."

"Delayed moral development remains superior to permanent moral stagnation."

"True." She opened her folder and removed several papers. "The Temple will accept replacement funds over the next quarter. I negotiated payment schedule that allows you to liquidate additional manuscripts gradually rather than conducting emergency sales at disadvantageous prices."

"Thank you. That demonstrates excellent financial planning."

"I have been managing your hoarding tendencies for eighty years. I know exactly which items you will actually part with versus which ones you will protect irrationally." Imelda made a notation on one document. "I prepared list of secondary manuscripts that can be sold without compromising core collection integrity."

Cornelius accepted the list and reviewed it carefully. The selections were logical. High-value items that existed in multiple institutional copies. Important but not irreplaceable. Exactly what he would have chosen himself if emotional attachment had not clouded judgment.

"This is acceptable," he said.

"I know." Imelda returned the papers to her folder. "Brother Demos sent message this morning. He is recovering adequately. The Temple administration has accepted his preliminary incident report regarding the Vault withdrawal. They are launching standard investigation but expect it will conclude that procedural protocols were followed even if medical justification was questionable."

"Bureaucratic mercy preserving institutional stability."

"Exactly." Imelda moved toward the door. "I am going to the Temple to finalize accounting reconciliation. You should rest. You look exhausted."

"Dragons do not become exhausted. We experience temporary reduction in optimal performance capacity."

"Exhausted," Imelda repeated. "Rest. That is direct instruction from your supervisor."

She departed before Cornelius could protest the characterization.

Silence settled over the library. Cornelius remained beside the shelf where the Chronicles had been. The gap seemed slightly less painful now. More like indication of necessary expense rather than permanent loss.

He moved to his private study—the small room behind the main archives where he kept personal items separate from public collection.

On his desk sat a stack of fresh paper. Good quality. Properly cut. Waiting for documentation.

Cornelius had maintained detailed journals for one hundred and twelve years. Complete records of library operations, collection development, and civic disputes. Thousands of pages documenting everything he considered significant enough to preserve.

He had never once written about choices that required sacrificing treasured possessions for people.

He had never documented what preservation actually meant beyond static hoarding.

He had never recorded the specific weight of deciding that some things were worth spending rather than keeping.

Cornelius selected a clean sheet. Retrieved his favorite pen—the one with proper weight and comfortable grip. Positioned himself at the desk with everything aligned correctly.

Then he began to write.

*Case Documentation: The Petrification of Brother Demos and Related Events*

*Day One: Sister Photine Kallistos reported the discovery of Brother Demos in complete petrification within the Temple Archives. Initial investigation suggested hostile magical assault. Subsequent evidence indicated more complicated circumstances involving...*

He paused. Considered the official story versus actual truth. Decided that this journal was private record rather than civic documentation.

*...involving a mother's desperate attempt to save her daughter from degenerative magical disease using experimental preservation techniques. The procedure succeeded. Complications arose. Brother Demos was accidentally affected by residual magic. Sister Photine made the calculated decision to prioritize her daughter's extraction over immediate reversal of Demos's condition.*

*I condemned that choice initially. Viewed it as abandonment. Classified it as medical negligence approaching murder.*

*I was wrong.*

*The choice was triage. Impossible mathematics forced by systems that criminalize mothers for protecting children. Photine saved who she could save and accepted that the equation would never balance perfectly.*

*I spent three days learning to make similar choices.*

Cornelius continued writing. He documented the investigation with complete honesty. The clues discovered. The deductions made. The moment he realized Melaina was Photine's daughter and what that meant under current genealogical law.

He wrote about burning the birth record. About selling the Chronicles. About standing in the Vault and offering Photine gold with no conditions except saving Demos first.

He wrote about watching the Constant Stanza sail away carrying refugees toward cities that did not prosecute mothers for acknowledging their children.

He wrote about Captain Theo accepting obviously fabricated fever root allergy explanation because some truths were more important than official accuracy.

When he finished, dawn had shifted to full morning. His hand ached from sustained writing. The pages covered his desk in organized documentation of everything that mattered.

Cornelius read through the account once. Made minor corrections to factual details. Added footnote about the specific scent of sandalwood and its association with Photine's preservation magic.

Then he filed the pages carefully in his personal archive.

Private record. Not for civic documentation. Just his own understanding of what had occurred and why it mattered.

The library door chimed. Cornelius emerged from his study to find Yiayia Despina entering with her customary basket and determined expression.

"I heard you sold the Founder's Chronicles," she announced. "To help the Temple with medical supplies."

"News travels efficiently through civic networks."

"Cassius told me. Who heard from Marcus Varen. Who heard from the collector who bought it." Yiayia settled into her preferred reading chair. "That was a good thing you did. Foolish maybe. But good."

"Foolish and good are not mutually exclusive categories."

"No. Usually they go together." She opened her basket and removed a cloth-wrapped package. "I brought you something. Payment for good deeds."

Cornelius approached cautiously. "I do not require payment."

"It is not payment. It is gratitude." Yiayia unwrapped the cloth to reveal fresh mint leaves bundled with careful precision. "From my garden. The good kind. Not the wild stuff."

The scent reached Cornelius immediately—sharp and clean and exactly perfect. His mouth began watering with involuntary response.

"This is acceptable gratitude," he managed.

"I thought it might be." Yiayia rewrapped the mint and set it on the desk. "The Temple will recover. The Enclave got away safely. Brother Demos is healing. Sister Photine and her daughter are beyond civic reach. Everyone who should have survived did survive."

"Not everyone. Some patients were lost before we understood the scope of the crisis."

"Some. Not all." Yiayia looked at him with eyes that had witnessed eighty-three years of civic complications. "That is the best anyone can do. Save who you can save. Let the rest go. Try again tomorrow."

Cornelius thought about equations that never balanced perfectly. About preservation that required spending treasured things. About hoarding versus actually protecting what mattered.

"Yes," he said quietly. "I am learning that lesson."

"Good. Learn it properly this time. You are old enough that delayed education is getting embarrassing." Yiayia stood up and collected her basket. "I will return tomorrow for regular reading hours. Try not to commit any additional crimes before then."

"I make no promises regarding future criminal activity."

"Honest answer. I appreciate that." She moved toward the exit. "Enjoy the mint, Library Dragon. You earned it."

After she departed, Cornelius remained beside the desk staring at the wrapped mint leaves.

The library was quiet around him. Properly organized. Adequately maintained. Missing one irreplaceable manuscript but functionally intact.

His hoard was smaller.

His conscience was clearer.

The mathematics balanced better than they had in one hundred and twenty-seven years.

Cornelius carefully unwrapped the mint and selected a single perfect leaf. He placed it on his tongue and closed his eyes while the flavor spread bright and sharp across his senses.

Outside, the city continued its usual patterns. Temple bells marking hours. Market crowds generating commerce noise. Civic life proceeding with characteristic human chaos.

Inside the library, a dragon who had spent more than a century hoarding knowledge sat in peaceful silence and understood—finally, definitively—that true preservation sometimes required letting treasured things go.

The mint tasted perfect.

The equation balanced.

Everything that should have survived had survived.

And tomorrow he would begin again with collections slightly diminished but purposes significantly clarified.

Preservation was not the same as hoarding.

Knowledge was meant to be spent when spending it saved lives.

And some losses were acceptable prices for ensuring the right things continued existing.

Cornelius finished the mint leaf and returned to his roost.

The empty space on the shelf remained visible.

He decided it could stay that way.

A permanent reminder of what mattered more than perfect collections.

A gap that meant something survived that otherwise would not have.

A price paid that actually purchased something worth preserving.

The library settled into comfortable silence around him.

And for the first time in longer than he cared to calculate, Cornelius felt genuinely satisfied with strategic resource allocation decisions.

The game was finished.

The preservation was complete.

The story could rest.
