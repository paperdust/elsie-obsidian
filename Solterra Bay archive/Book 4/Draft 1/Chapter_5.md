# Chapter 5

The library bell system rarely malfunctioned. Cornelius had personally maintained it for sixty-three years, cleaning mechanisms and adjusting tensions with the same care he applied to manuscript restoration. So when the civic alarm began clanging—not the gentle chime signaling hours but the harsh, repetitive sequence reserved for emergencies—he knew immediately that something fundamental had broken in the city's administrative order.

He looked up from his preparations for the Enclave visit. His satchel lay open on the reference desk, organized with notebook, pencils, and reference materials. The vial of lavender oil sat beside it, ready for olfactory comparison. Everything arranged with methodical precision.

The alarm continued. Three beats. Pause. Three beats. Pause.

Assembly summons. Mandatory civic attendance.

Cornelius moved to the window. Below, citizens were emerging from shops and homes, drawn toward the central square like iron filings responding to lodestone. The movement carried the particular quality of confusion—people knew they had to attend but not why.

"Is that the alarm?" Zeph appeared at the top of the stairs, arms full of returned volumes. "Like, the actual emergency alarm? I thought that was just for fires and invasions."

"Or civic emergencies requiring immediate community response." Cornelius abandoned his satchel and moved toward the entrance. "Which apparently includes whatever the Council has decided warrants disrupting commerce and daily operations."

"Should I come?"

"Attendance is mandatory for all citizens above the age of fourteen."

"Cool. Let me just—" Zeph dumped the books on the nearest reading table with a thud that made Cornelius's scales prickle. "I'll reshelve those later."

They descended together, Cornelius gliding from the entrance stairs while Zeph jogged to keep pace. The square was filling rapidly. Cornelius recognized the usual town fixtures—Cassius from the bakery, Yiayia Despina with her walking stick, merchants still wearing their work aprons. The crowd arranged itself in loose concentric circles around the Council platform, a raised stone dais normally used for official proclamations and seasonal festivals.

Four Council members stood on the platform. Captain Theo flanked them, his Watch uniform precisely pressed despite the late hour. His expression carried the particular neutrality of someone enforcing policy he had not authored but would implement regardless.

Councilor Philippos stepped forward. He was a broad man, his formal robes straining slightly across his chest. His voice carried the practiced projection of someone accustomed to public speaking.

"Citizens. Thank you for your prompt attendance. The Council has made a decision regarding the recent assault on Brother Demos and the ongoing investigation."

Cornelius felt his tail curl tighter around his feet. The phrasing was ominous. Not an update. A decision.

"The petrification of a Temple healer represents a direct threat to community safety and public order," Philippos continued. "After consultation with Captain Theo and the Temple leadership, the Council has determined that exceptional measures are required to secure the perpetrator and prevent additional attacks."

Murmurs rippled through the crowd. Cornelius saw Kyra standing near the fountain, her posture rigid. Several other Gorgons clustered together near the market stalls, their expressions wary.

"Effective immediately, the Council is implementing a mandatory registration and supervision protocol for all Gorgon citizens." Philippos gestured to Theo. "Captain Theo will coordinate the process. All Gorgons are required to report to the Watch station for documentation and assignment of movement restrictions until the investigation concludes."

The murmurs became louder. Cornelius heard fragments—"not right" and "what restrictions" and "they cannot do that."

Apparently they could.

"This is a temporary security measure," Philippos said, raising his voice slightly. "Once the perpetrator is identified and Brother Demos is restored, normal civic operations will resume. Until then, compliance is mandatory. Failure to register will result in detention."

Xanthe's voice cut through the crowd noise. "You are calling it registration. The rest of us recognize it as a roundup."

Philippos's expression hardened. "It is a lawful exercise of Council emergency authority."

"It is collective punishment based on species. We have names for that in history texts. None of them are complimentary."

"The Council is not interested in historical debate. We are interested in public safety." Philippos gestured to Theo again. "Captain, please explain the procedural details."

Theo stepped forward. His gaze swept the crowd, pausing briefly on Cornelius before moving on. "Registration will begin at dawn tomorrow. Gorgon citizens report to the Watch station with identification documents. You will be assigned a supervisor who will approve all movements outside designated residential areas. Violations will result in immediate detention pending investigation."

"For how long?" Kyra's voice remained steady despite the tension visible in her shoulders. "How long does this restriction remain in effect?"

"Until the Council determines the threat has been neutralized."

"That is not an answer. That is indefinite detention disguised as safety protocol."

"That is emergency governance responding to magical assault." Theo's tone allowed no argument. "If you have complaints about Council procedure, file them through official channels. Until then, compliance is mandatory."

The crowd began fragmenting. Some citizens moved toward the Council platform with questions. Others retreated toward homes and businesses. The Gorgon cluster near the market stalls dispersed quickly, heads down, moving with the specific body language of people trying to avoid attention while seething with anger.

Cornelius remained stationary, processing implications. The roundup was legally questionable but procedurally enforceable. The Council technically possessed emergency authority for public safety threats. The definition of "threat" was elastic enough to justify nearly anything if framed properly.

And Melaina—the Flower, hidden somewhere in the Enclave—would be forced to register or become a fugitive.

Assuming she was capable of registration. The rumors suggested illness severe enough to require Mother Ligeia's personal protection. If Melaina could not physically present herself for registration...

The Watch would come looking.

Zeph appeared beside him. "That was messed up. That was really, really messed up."

"It was legally authorized civic emergency protocol."

"It was racist."

"Species-based rather than race-based, technically. Though the moral distinction is minimal." Cornelius turned away from the square. "We should return to the library."

"Shouldn't we—I don't know—protest or something? That's what you're supposed to do when the government does evil stuff, right?"

"Protest is a long-term civic engagement strategy. The roundup begins at dawn. That provides approximately twelve hours for alternative solutions." Cornelius spread his wings. "I need to reach the Enclave before Watch patrols begin enforcement sweeps."

"Right. Yeah. The Flower." Zeph hesitated. "You think Mother Ligeia will even talk to you now? She's going to be busy protecting everyone."

Cornelius did not have an answer that provided comfort. He launched himself toward the library, riding the thermal currents above the emptying square.

Behind him, the Council platform stood empty. The emergency had been declared. The protocols engaged.

And somewhere in the Gorgon quarter, a sick child faced the choice between exposure and hiding.

Cornelius had nearly reached the library entrance when he saw Zeph running up the street below, waving frantically.

He circled back, landing on the entrance steps. "What is wrong?"

Zeph skidded to a stop, breathing hard. "Changed my mind. I'm coming with you to the Enclave."

"Absolutely not. The situation is now significantly more dangerous than—"

"I'm not asking permission. I'm telling you I'm coming." Zeph's expression carried unexpected steel. "You said people need help. The Flower needs help. I can help."

"You can help by remaining safely at the library and maintaining normal operations."

"The library doesn't need maintaining right now. People do." Zeph crossed his arms. "Also, you're bad at talking to scared people. You do the whole 'logical analysis of your emotional distress' thing and it makes everything worse. I'm better at that."

"I am perfectly capable of—" Cornelius stopped. He was not particularly capable of comforting frightened individuals. His communication style prioritized information transfer over emotional validation. "Your point has limited merit."

"So I'm coming."

Cornelius's tail lashed once. The argument was valid but the risk remained unacceptable. Zeph was sixteen, unaware of his Lamassu heritage, and fundamentally unprepared for confrontation with Watch enforcement or Enclave politics.

Before Cornelius could formulate an adequately discouraging response, movement at the end of the street caught his attention.

Zeph walking toward them.

That made no sense. Zeph stood directly in front of him, still breathing hard from his run. The approaching figure could not also be Zeph unless—

Cornelius adjusted his spectacles. The approaching figure walked with Zeph's particular loose-limbed gait but moved more slowly, supported by—

No. Supporting someone else.

As they drew closer, details resolved. Zeph—the actual Zeph standing before him—turned and went rigid.

"Oh no."

The approaching pair emerged into the library's entrance lantern light. A second Zeph supported a Gorgon girl who looked barely older than him. She wore a simple tunic and leaned heavily against him, her movements suggesting significant physical distress. Her serpent hair hung limp, responding to her weakened state with minimal animation.

Zeph—the genuine article standing beside Cornelius—ran toward them. "What are you doing here?"

The second Zeph did not answer because the second Zeph was not Zeph at all. As Cornelius watched, the features rippled and reformed into someone else entirely—a young man with similar build but different face, different coloring, different everything.

Shapeshifter.

The disguised individual helped the Gorgon girl settle onto the library steps. "She can't do the registration. She can barely walk. I thought—" He looked at actual-Zeph. "You said the library was safe. You said the dragon helped people."

"I said Cornelius *might* help. I didn't say bring her here while the Watch is literally organizing a roundup." Zeph crouched beside the girl. "Are you okay?"

She did not answer. Her eyes were half-closed, her breathing shallow.

Cornelius descended the steps slowly, maintaining non-threatening body language. The shapeshifter watched him with obvious wariness.

"Who are you?" Cornelius asked.

"Niko. I'm—" The young man glanced at the Gorgon girl. "I'm trying to help."

"By impersonating my intern and bringing an unregistered Gorgon to the most public building in the civic quarter?"

"I didn't know where else to go. Mother Ligeia said—" Niko stopped, recalibrating. "She said we had to get Melaina out before the Watch started searching properly. Said there was a dragon who understood preservation."

Melaina. The Flower.

Cornelius moved closer, examining the girl's condition with the clinical detachment he applied to damaged manuscripts. Pale skin—unusual for Gorgons, who typically maintained warmth-adapted complexions. Trembling despite the evening's moderate temperature. Serpent hair moving in slow, uncoordinated patterns suggesting neurological distress.

And beneath the visible symptoms, something else.

A scent.

Subtle. Familiar. Wrong.

Cornelius leaned closer, identifying the fragrance components with the trained precision of someone who spent decades cataloging ancient texts by their preservation methods.

Sandalwood.

The same scent from the Archives. From the space beside Demos's petrified body.

Cornelius went absolutely still.

Melaina—this sick, trembling child—carried the perpetrator's signature.

"Cornelius?" Zeph's voice carried concern. "What's wrong?"

Everything. Everything was wrong. The Flower was not a victim requiring rescue. The Flower was evidence. Possibly the weapon itself. The sandalwood connected her directly to the crime scene, to Demos's petrification, to—

He looked at Melaina's pallid face. Her half-conscious state. The way she struggled to breathe.

Or.

Or she was both.

"Get inside," Cornelius said quietly. "Quickly. Before someone sees."

Niko and Zeph exchanged glances. Zeph spoke first. "You're helping?"

"I am making a calculation regarding acceptable risk versus moral obligation. The calculation is incomplete but time-sensitive." Cornelius moved toward the entrance. "Bring her to the lower stacks. The eastern section behind the historical archives."

Where he kept the hidden books.

Where the tiles lifted and the walls had hollow spaces perfect for concealment.

Zeph helped Niko support Melaina up the steps. The girl moved like someone operating beyond exhaustion, body functioning through pure survival instinct. Cornelius led them through the main reading room—mercifully empty at this hour—and down the stairs to the lower levels.

The historical archives occupied the library's oldest section. Stone walls a yard thick. Temperature controlled by earth insulation rather than magical intervention. Shelves built during the city's founding, designed to last centuries rather than decades.

And behind those shelves, carefully concealed gaps where Cornelius stored the volumes he could not bear to catalog publicly.

His hoard.

Now, apparently, his illegal sanctuary for fugitive Gorgons who smelled like crime scenes.

"Here." Cornelius indicated the eastern corner where three shelves met at awkward angles, creating a natural alcove. He pressed specific stones in sequence—a combination he had never shared with anyone—and heard the mechanical click of the release mechanism.

The center shelf swung outward on hidden hinges, revealing a space approximately six feet deep and four feet wide. Books lined the walls in neat stacks. Rare treatises. Irreplaceable manuscripts. His secret preservation project spanning six decades.

Zeph stared. "You have a hidden room full of books."

"I have a climate-controlled storage space for volumes requiring special protection."

"You have a dragon hoard behind a secret door."

"The terminology is irrelevant. Help settle her inside."

Niko and Zeph guided Melaina into the space. She curled immediately into the corner, pulling her knees to her chest. Her serpent hair coiled around her shoulders in a defensive posture.

Cornelius noted her positioning. She had chosen the corner despite multiple options. Prey behavior. Injured-animal instinct to protect vulnerable areas while maintaining visual access to threats.

Not the behavior of a confident perpetrator.

But absolutely the behavior of someone central to whatever actually happened in the Archives.

"She needs water," Cornelius said. "And medical assessment, which I am unqualified to provide. But water first."

Zeph ran back toward the stairs. Niko remained, perched awkwardly in the hidden room's entrance.

"Thank you," Niko said quietly. "I know this is—I know you're taking a risk."

"I am taking several risks, including harboring an unregistered individual during civic emergency protocols, obstructing investigation, and providing sanctuary to someone who potentially petrified a Temple healer." Cornelius adjusted his spectacles. "The sandalwood scent suggests direct connection to the crime scene."

Niko's expression shifted into something complicated. Not surprise. Recognition.

"You know," Cornelius said. Not a question.

"I—" Niko looked at Melaina. "It's not what you think."

"I think very little at this stage. I observe and catalogue facts. Currently, the facts indicate logical cause for Watch detention and formal interrogation."

"She's dying."

The blunt statement sat between them like a physical object.

"From what?" Cornelius asked.

"Nobody knows. She just—it started two weeks ago. Fever first, then weakness, then this." Niko gestured to Melaina's curled form. "Mother Ligeia tried everything. Temple remedies, traditional Enclave medicine, every healer she could find. Nothing works. The fever keeps rising and Melaina keeps fading."

Two weeks. Demos had been running secret charity treatments. Demos had been visiting the Gorgon quarter at night.

"Did Demos treat her?" Cornelius asked.

Niko hesitated, then nodded. "Three times. He was trying to stabilize the fever. But it wasn't working, and he said she needed Temple facilities for proper diagnosis. Tests he couldn't do from a bag."

"When was his last visit?"

"The night before—" Niko stopped. His expression confirmed what Cornelius had already deduced.

"The night before he was petrified."

"Yes."

Footsteps on the stairs announced Zeph's return. He carried a clay pitcher and cup, moving carefully to avoid spills. "Got water. Also grabbed some bread in case she can eat."

Melaina took the cup with shaking hands. She drank three small sips before setting it aside, the effort apparently exhausting her remaining strength.

Cornelius watched her. Seventeen years old according to the intelligence Zeph had gathered. Barely older than Zeph himself. Sick enough that walking required assistance. Fragile enough that persecution would likely accelerate whatever was already consuming her.

And carrying the perpetrator's scent.

The library bell chimed the hour. Somewhere above them, the city continued its evening routines. Citizens securing homes. Watch preparing patrol schedules. The Council's roundup machinery organizing for dawn implementation.

And here, in the oldest part of the library, Cornelius faced a choice.

Report Melaina and potentially solve the case while guaranteeing her detention during active illness.

Or hide her and become complicit in obstruction.

His entire professional existence had been built on order, rules, proper procedure. He catalogued. He preserved. He maintained systems designed to  last beyond individual lives or temporary crises.

He did not harbor fugitives.

He looked at the stacks of hidden books surrounding Melaina. Volumes he had kept secret for decades, hoarded against imagined future losses. Knowledge preserved so carefully it served no one.

Demos had not preserved. Demos had spent. Medicine, time, his own exhausted capacity—all deployed without regard for sustainability because people needed help immediately, not theoretically.

And now Demos was stone.

Possibly because of Melaina. Possibly because of something that connected to Melaina. The details remained unclear.

But the child before him—sick, frightened, hunted—was definitely and immediately in danger.

"She stays," Cornelius said.

Zeph's relief was visible. "Really?"

"Temporarily. Until I determine actual circumstances and appropriate action." Cornelius moved toward the hidden room's entrance. "Close the door behind me. The mechanism locks from outside. I will return at dawn."

"Where are you going?" Niko asked.

"To retrieve medical supplies from the Temple stores while the charity sale is being catalogued. If Melaina is dying, hiding her is insufficient. We need to address the dying part."

"That's stealing."

"Correct. Add it to my expanding list of criminal activities this evening." Cornelius stepped back into the archives proper. "Neither of you leave this section. If anyone comes looking, you are researching historical building records for a civic architecture project. Zeph is documented as authorized for archive access. Niko—if questioned—is a consulting specialist from the Builders' Guild."

Zeph nodded. Niko still looked uncertain.

Cornelius moved toward the stairs, then paused. "The sandalwood. Where did it come from?"

Niko met his gaze steadily. "Sister Photine. She brought medicine in a sandalwood chest when she came to examine Melaina. Said it would help preserve the fever treatments."

Sister Photine.

Head Temple Healer. Demos's supervisor. The person Kyra had visited for passing consultations. The individual who had shown visceral terror and grief at Demos's petrification.

The person who had access to the Archives, to Demos's schedule, to Temple resources and records.

Cornelius felt pieces shifting in his understanding, patterns reforming into new configurations.

"Stay hidden," he said again. "I will return."

He climbed the stairs with his mind racing through implications and connections. Photine and Melaina. Photine and the sandalwood. Photine's fear preceding Demos's petrification, suggesting she knew something terrible was coming.

Or had already done something terrible.

He reached the main reading room and stopped.

Heavy footsteps outside. Multiple individuals approaching with the particular rhythm of coordinated movement.

Cornelius moved to the window.

Six Watch guards arranged themselves at the library's entrance. Captain Theo stood at their center, a document scroll in hand.

They climbed the entrance steps. Theo raised his hand toward the door.

And knocked.

The sound echoed through the library like thunder, formal and inevitable.

Cornelius looked back toward the stairs descending to the archives. To the hidden room. To the fugitive Gorgon child surrounded by his secret hoard.

The knocking came again. Louder. Insistent.

"This is Captain Theo Melas of the City Watch. Open for official inspection."

Cornelius smoothed his scales and moved toward the entrance.

The game, it seemed, had fundamentally changed.
