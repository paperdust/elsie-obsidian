# Chapter 16

The docks smelled like everything Cornelius had spent one hundred and twenty-seven years avoiding.

Brine. Tar. Fish guts decomposing in inadequate drainage systems. Unwashed sailors. Barrel wood that had absorbed decades of questionable cargo. The entire harbor district assaulted his senses with chaotic intensity that made his scales itch with the need to flee back to climate-controlled archive storage.

He landed on a relatively clean section of planking and immediately regretted the decision. The wood was slick with substances he preferred not to identify. His claws found purchase but the texture was wrong—too smooth, too organic, distinctly biological in a way that suggested recent contact with marine life.

"Where do we even start?" Zeph arrived breathing hard, having run the distance from the Temple while Cornelius flew. The boy looked around at the chaos of docked vessels with an expression that mirrored Cornelius's internal dismay. "There are like fifty ships here."

"Forty-three currently visible from this vantage point." Cornelius adjusted his spectacles and surveyed the harbor. "However, most are commercial cargo vessels or passenger ships with official registry. The Constant Stanza operates without manifest documentation, which limits probable docking locations to areas with minimal Watch oversight."

"So the sketchy part of the sketchy docks."

"Imprecise but functionally accurate." Cornelius moved along the planking, avoiding puddles of unknown origin. "Smuggler vessels prefer berths with easy harbor access but poor sight lines from Watch stations. Typically the farthest piers from central administration."

They moved deeper into the dock district. The organized chaos of legitimate commerce gave way to seedier operations—vessels with deliberately obscured names, captains conducting quiet conversations with hooded figures, cargo transfers happening with conspicuous lack of documentation.

Cornelius's analytical mind cataloged details despite his physical discomfort. The harbor followed predictable patterns. Legal ships clustered near customs inspection. Questionable operations spread toward the periphery where oversight thinned and officials could be convinced to look elsewhere for modest financial considerations.

"That one." Zeph pointed toward a mid-sized vessel docked at the end of a sagging pier. "The name is covered but I can see part of what looks like fancy painted letters underneath the tarp."

Cornelius looked. The ship showed signs of deliberate anonymity—covered nameplate, minimal deck activity, crew members who carried themselves with the particular alertness of people conducting illegal business. But underneath the concealment measures, the vessel's construction suggested quality. Expensive wood. Professional maintenance. The result of successful smuggling operations rather than desperate criminal enterprise.

"Approach carefully," Cornelius said. "Do not indicate official investigation or Watch affiliation. We are potential customers seeking passage information."

They moved along the pier. The planking here was even worse—rotted sections patched with mismatched wood, gaps showing water below, the entire structure swaying with each wave. Cornelius spread his wings for balance and tried not to calculate the probability of structural failure.

A sailor emerged from below deck as they approached. Human. Female. Approximately forty years old with the weathered skin and careful eyes of someone who had survived decades of illegal maritime commerce.

"We are not taking passengers," she said before Cornelius could speak. "Private charter. Fully booked."

"I am not seeking passage." Cornelius kept his tone professionally neutral. "I am attempting to locate a specific vessel. The Constant Stanza. I have urgent business with individuals who arranged transport aboard that ship."

The sailor's expression did not change but her posture shifted fractionally—the subtle adjustment that indicated Cornelius had said something significant.

"You got names?" she asked.

"Sister Photine Kallistos. Possibly traveling with five additional passengers. Departure scheduled for fifth bell today." Cornelius watched her face carefully. "I am not Watch affiliated. I am not attempting to interfere with your business operations. I simply need to communicate with Photine before departure."

The sailor studied him for a long moment. Then looked at Zeph. Then back at Cornelius.

"You are the dragon from the library," she said finally. "The one who helped with that business last year when the merchant guild tried to claim historical precedent for reduced dock fees."

Cornelius did not remember that specific incident but his archive included extensive documentation of civic disputes involving historical record interpretation. Very likely he had provided reference materials to someone at some point during those proceedings.

"I maintain historical records that occasionally prove relevant to modern legal disputes," he said carefully.

"You saved those dock workers from getting fired when the guild wanted to cut labor costs using some old contract nobody could read anymore." The sailor's expression softened fractionally. "My brother works those docks. He says you are decent for bureaucratic dragon types."

"I am gratified that my professional services were appreciated." Cornelius filed that interaction away as an example of long-term reputation benefits from competent archival work. "Does that mean you will confirm whether this vessel is in fact the Constant Stanza?"

The sailor gestured toward the covered nameplate. "This is the Stanza. Your people are not here yet. Quartermaster is below if you want to discuss their passage arrangements. But make it quick. We sail at sunset whether they show or not."

"Understood. Thank you for your cooperation."

Cornelius moved toward the gangplank—a narrow board connecting pier to deck that swayed with disturbing flexibility. He paused. Calculated weight distribution. Determined that dragon anatomy did not favor single-plank crossings over water.

"I hate boats," he muttered.

"You can fly," Zeph pointed out.

"I am aware of my capabilities. That does not reduce my distaste for nautical architecture." But Cornelius spread his wings for balance and walked the gangplank with as much dignity as a dragon could muster while wobbling on wet wood.

The deck showed evidence of professional smuggling operations—concealed compartments for cargo, rigging designed for speed rather than capacity, minimal visible armament but plenty of subtle defensive positioning. A ship built to run rather than fight but capable of both when necessary.

Below deck was darker and significantly more cramped. Cornelius descended carefully, his claws finding inadequate purchase on steep stairs designed for human feet. The air was thick with the smell of wood preservative and old cargo residue.

A woman sat at a small desk wedged into what had probably been designed as storage space. She looked up as Cornelius entered, showed no surprise at a dragon's appearance, and returned her attention to the ledger open before her.

"Quartermaster?" Cornelius asked.

"That would be me. If you are here about the medical supplies run to the southern ports, we are still negotiating rates with the Temple procurement office."

"I am here regarding the six passengers scheduled for departure today. The party associated with Sister Photine Kallistos."

The quartermaster flipped backward through her ledger. Found the relevant page. Examined it with the particular focus of someone who managed complex illegal logistics.

"What about them?" she asked without looking up.

"I need to know their current status. Whether they have arrived, whether passage has been finalized, whether—"

"Payment is pending," the quartermaster interrupted. "Passage was arranged through an intermediary a week ago. Deposit covered administrative fees and berth reservations. Final payment for six passengers is due at departure. If they show up with the gold, they sail. If not, berths get sold to next available customers."

Cornelius's scales stopped prickling and went absolutely still. "Payment is pending?"

"That is what I said."

"How much payment is pending?"

The quartermaster consulted her ledger. "Three thousand nine hundred crowns for six passengers with minimal luggage, priority berth assignments, and discretionary documentation. Half now, half on arrival as per standard terms for this route."

Cornelius did rapid calculations. Photine had burned documents referencing the Constant Stanza in her dormitory hearth. She had cleared her room of all possessions. She had arranged for her own passage plus five others—presumably Mother Ligeia and key Enclave leadership.

But she had not paid.

Which meant all those careful preparations, all that systematic evidence destruction, all that desperate planning was predicated on securing approximately two thousand crowns before departure.

Two thousand crowns that Photine did not possess.

Temple healers earned professional salaries but not fortunes. Photine had spent years channeling resources to Melaina's secret treatment. She had purchased expensive quarantine supplies. She had maintained two separate lives—public healer and private mother—with all the financial strain that deception required.

Cornelius had six hundred crowns in his satchel right now. Enough to make a significant contribution toward passage cost but not enough to cover the full amount.

And Photine did not know he had sold his hoard. Did not know he was carrying gold specifically to help fund her escape. Did not know that anyone except Mother Ligeia might be willing to provide financial assistance.

She thought she had to acquire two thousand crowns entirely through her own resources.

But she had no resources left.

"Thank you for the information," Cornelius said quietly. "We will return shortly."

He climbed back up the steep stairs, his mind assembling implications with increasing alarm. On deck, he moved to the rail and looked out at the harbor. The sun was lower now. Perhaps ninety minutes before sunset. Perhaps ninety minutes before the Constant Stanza departed with or without its scheduled passengers.

Zeph joined him at the rail. "What did you find out?"

"Photine has not paid for the passage. Payment is pending until departure."

"But she arranged it a week ago. She had time to—" Zeph stopped. "Oh. She does not have the money."

"No. She does not have the money." Cornelius watched a cargo vessel maneuver toward deeper water. "She arranged passage when she believed she had access to funds. Mother Ligeia presumably organized financial contributions from Enclave members for the other five passengers. But Photine's personal share remains unpaid."

"So she can't leave. She'll be stuck here when the ship sails."

"Unless she acquires two thousand crowns in the next ninety minutes." Cornelius turned that problem over in his analytical mind. Two thousand crowns. Photine's current resources were minimal. Her possessions sold or abandoned. Her Temple salary insufficient for that amount. Her family connections unavailable due to the need for secrecy.

Where would a desperate healer with no money and no time acquire two thousand crowns?

The answer assembled with terrible clarity.

"The Temple Vault," Cornelius said.

Zeph looked confused. "What about it?"

"The Temple maintains emergency medical funds in a secured vault. Gold reserves for purchasing supplies during sudden need—epidemic response, mass casualty events, natural disasters requiring immediate intervention." Cornelius's claws gripped the rail. "Photine has vault access as senior healer. She has authorization to withdraw funds for legitimate medical emergencies."

"But this is not an emergency. This is her running away."

"She does not view it as running away. She views it as preserving her daughter's life through the only means available." Cornelius thought of the birth record he had burned. The careful evidence destruction in Photine's dormitory. The systematic planning evident in every action. "And she knows the vault contains sufficient funds because she participated in recent inventory documentation following the resource crisis."

Comprehension spread across Zeph's expression. "You think she is going to rob the Temple."

"I think she is going to withdraw emergency funds under false pretenses and flee before the theft is discovered." Cornelius released the rail and turned toward the gangplank. "The vault would have been recently restocked following our book donations. Possibly ten thousand crowns or more depending on ongoing procurement needs. More than sufficient for passage costs."

"But that is Temple money. Medical supplies funding. If she steals it—"

"The Temple will survive temporarily reduced reserves. But Photine's calculation is not about long-term institutional impact. Her calculation is about her daughter's survival measured against professional ethics and legal constraints." Cornelius moved toward the pier. "She has already petrified three people, destroyed official records, and planned elaborate escape procedures. Vault robbery represents a comparatively minor additional crime."

They reached the pier and Cornelius paused, his analytical mind running through logistics. The Temple Vault was three districts away. Photine would need to access it during normal administrative hours to avoid suspicion. Withdrawal documentation would need to appear legitimate until after departure when investigation revealed the fraud.

Current time was approximately thirty minutes past the previous hour. Sunset in ninety minutes. The vault closed at final bell—roughly one hour from now.

Photine would strike soon. Possibly within the next twenty or thirty minutes.

"We need to return to the Temple immediately," Cornelius said.

"To stop her?"

"No. To ensure she succeeds without getting caught." Cornelius spread his wings and prepared for flight. "If she is arrested during the robbery attempt, she cannot reverse the petrifications. Demos dies. Melaina remains stone permanently. And Photine faces execution for theft in addition to all her other crimes."

"But if she robs the vault and escapes, the Temple loses money it needs for patients."

"I am aware of the moral complications." Cornelius's scales prickled with discomfort at his own reasoning. "However, the Temple can replace stolen funds through additional fundraising. We cannot replace Demos or reverse Melaina's condition or secure Photine's cooperation if she is in Watch custody."

Zeph looked torn between agreement and distress. "We are helping a thief rob a medical charity."

"We are preventing a desperate mother from being arrested while attempting to fund her daughter's escape from execution." Cornelius crouched. "Get on my back. We do not have time for you to run the distance."

Zeph climbed up without further argument. His weight settled between Cornelius's wings with familiar pressure. Cornelius adjusted his balance and launched himself upward with enough force to clear the docked ships.

The harbor district spread below. Vessels clustered around piers. Cargo operations proceeded with organized chaos. People moved through maritime commerce completely unaware that three districts away, a healer was probably preparing to commit robbery.

Cornelius angled toward the Temple and increased his speed. Wind pressure made his spectacles slide slightly. He adjusted them with one claw while maintaining flight trajectory through practiced coordination.

"How do we help without getting caught ourselves?" Zeph's voice carried over the wind. "If she sees us, she will know we know."

"We do not interfere directly. We observe. We ensure Watch presence does not interfere. We provide distraction if necessary." Cornelius flew over the commercial district. "And if she succeeds, we follow her back to the docks and provide the additional six hundred crowns I obtained from selling the Chronicles."

"That covers the full payment."

"Yes. She acquires two thousand from the vault. I contribute six hundred from my liquidated hoard. Total available funds equal two thousand six hundred crowns—sufficient for passenger costs plus modest bribes or emergency expenses." Cornelius descended toward the Temple district. "She escapes. Reverses the petrifications before departure. Sails with her daughter toward a city without genealogical persecution. Everyone survives."

"Except the Temple is missing two thousand crowns."

"The Temple will survive. Institutions possess resilience that individual people lack." But Cornelius felt the weight of that calculation. Two thousand crowns represented significant medical purchasing power. Bandages. Medicines. Supplies that would treat patients who could not afford private healers.

He was choosing Photine over those unknown future patients.

The equation felt uncomfortably similar to triage decisions he had criticized earlier. Who deserved saving more—one woman and her daughter, or dozens of poor patients who depended on Temple charity?

Except that framing was inaccurate. Saving Photine also saved Demos. And Demos had sold his own grave to fund charity medicine for exactly those vulnerable patients.

If Cornelius allowed Photine to be arrested, he was effectively choosing to let Demos die. And Demos's death would represent the loss of a healer who had spent himself completely trying to help the people the Temple excluded.

The moral mathematics balanced differently depending on how many variables were included.

Cornelius pushed the calculation aside and focused on immediate logistics. The Temple's administrative wing appeared ahead—stone architecture, organized courtyards, the vault entrance accessible through the eastern corridor.

He landed in a service courtyard away from main traffic and allowed Zeph to dismount.

"The vault is two corridors east," Cornelius said quietly. "Photine will likely already be inside completing withdrawal documentation. We need to position ourselves where we can observe without being noticed."

"You are a dragon. You get noticed."

"I am a Library Dragon with legitimate professional relationship to Temple operations. My presence near administrative areas is not inherently suspicious." Cornelius moved toward the eastern corridor. "You, however, should remain out of sight. Adolescent humans loitering near vault access during withdrawal procedures would attract attention."

Zeph looked annoyed but did not argue. He moved to a shadowed alcove with sight lines to the corridor entrance.

Cornelius proceeded with careful steps, his claws clicking against stone floors. The Temple's interior felt wrong. Too quiet. Less activity than normal administrative hours should produce. But of course—many staff members had departed early due to the ongoing crisis. Reduced personnel coverage would make vault access easier for someone with authorization.

He reached the junction point where the eastern corridor branched toward vault access. Paused. Listened.

Voices carried from deeper in the corridor. Female voice. Professional tone. Discussing withdrawal documentation and emergency authorization codes.

Photine.

Cornelius moved closer but kept himself positioned around the corner where he could hear but not be directly visible. His senses strained to interpret the conversation.

"—completely legitimate emergency requisition signed by the senior healer on duty." Photine's voice had the particular controlled quality that indicated someone performing rather than speaking naturally. "Medical supplies procurement for quarantine supplies following exposure protocol activation."

"I am not questioning your authorization." A different voice—probably the vault administrator. "I am simply noting that we had recent large-scale donations that just restocked these reserves. Withdrawing two thousand crowns this quickly seems unusual."

"The exposure risk is unusual. I cannot provide specific patient details due to privacy protocols but the situation requires immediate supply acquisition." A pause. "Do you need me to escalate this to higher authority? Because the time delay could compromise containment."

"No. No, that is not necessary. Your authorization is valid." Sounds of movement. Keys. A heavy door opening. "Two thousand in standard crowns? This will take a few minutes to count."

"I will wait."

Cornelius silently moved fractionally closer. His analytical mind cataloged details. Photine was using exposure protocol as justification—implying infectious disease risk that would make questioning dangerous. The vault administrator was uncomfortable but not suspicious enough to refuse a senior healer's legitimate authorization.

The robbery was proceeding successfully.

Footsteps approached from behind Cornelius. He turned sharply and saw Zeph emerging from his hiding position with urgent expression.

"Watch patrol," Zeph whispered. "Coming through the main corridor. Two guards. They are going to pass right by the vault entrance."

Cornelius's mind calculated implications instantly. Watch presence near the vault during suspicious withdrawal would potentially trigger questions. Questions would create delays. Delays would make Photine miss her departure window.

They needed a distraction.

Something that would redirect Watch attention away from the vault corridor without creating enough disturbance to attract additional security response.

"Go to the main courtyard," Cornelius said quietly. "Start yelling about a medical emergency at the charity clinic entrance. Claim someone collapsed requiring immediate healer response. When the guards investigate, maintain the performance until Photine completes the withdrawal and departs."

"What if they realize I am lying?"

"Then apologize and claim you were mistaken but genuinely concerned. Fear of disciplinary action is less important than preventing Photine's arrest." Cornelius nudged him toward the courtyard. "Go. Now. Before they reach this corridor."

Zeph ran.

Cornelius repositioned himself where he could observe the vault corridor while also monitoring the Watch patrol's approach. Heavy footsteps. Professional conversation about patrol routes and shift schedules. Getting closer.

Then, from the direction of the main courtyard, Zeph's voice rang out with impressive panic. "Help! Someone help! There is a man collapsed by the clinic entrance! He is not breathing! We need a healer!"

The footsteps stopped. Brief consultation between the guards. Then rapid movement toward the courtyard and away from the vault corridor.

Cornelius allowed himself a moment of satisfaction. Zeph had good instincts for crisis improvisation.

The vault door opened again. Photine emerged with a leather satchel that hung heavily against her side. Her expression was composed but her hands shook slightly as she closed the door behind her.

She moved quickly down the corridor without noticing Cornelius in his shadowed position.

He waited until she had turned the far corner. Then he followed at careful distance, maintaining enough separation to avoid detection while keeping her in audible range.

Photine moved through the Temple's corridors with the confidence of someone who belonged there. No hesitation. No suspicious behavior. Just a senior healer conducting normal administrative business.

She exited through the eastern service entrance—the same entrance Cornelius had used earlier—and emerged into the courtyard beyond.

Cornelius watched from the doorway as she crossed the courtyard and disappeared into the street network leading toward the harbor.

She had succeeded.

Two thousand crowns in her satchel.

Approximately seventy-five minutes until sunset.

Enough time to reach the docks, board the Constant Stanza, and depart before theft discovery.

Cornelius turned back toward the main courtyard where Zeph would be maintaining his medical emergency performance. He needed to extract the boy before Watch guards realized the emergency was fabricated.

But as he moved through the corridor, a thought occurred to him.

Photine had the money now. She would pay for passage. Board the ship. Sail at sunset.

But she still needed to reverse the petrifications.

And Demos was at the library. Melaina was at the library. Both in stone. Both requiring Photine's specific magical intervention to restore.

She could not board the ship without reversing them first.

Which meant she would return to the library after securing passage.

Which meant Cornelius needed to be there when she arrived.

He increased his pace and located Zeph in the main courtyard explaining apologetically to two Watch guards that the collapsed man had apparently recovered and departed before healers arrived.

"Very sorry for the false alarm," Zeph was saying. "I really thought he was dying but maybe he was just drunk? Or sleeping? I am not good at medical assessment."

The guards looked annoyed but not suspicious. One of them waved Zeph away with the particular dismissiveness applied to adolescent overreaction.

Cornelius intercepted the boy as he retreated. "We need to return to the library. Photine will reverse the petrifications before boarding the ship."

"How do you know?"

"Because she cannot sail with her daughter still in stone." Cornelius moved toward the courtyard exit. "She acquired the money. She will secure passage. Then she will return to extract Melaina from my archive and reverse all three transformations before final departure."

They emerged into the street. The sun was lower now. Shadows lengthening. The particular quality of late afternoon light that indicated sunset approached.

Cornelius spread his wings. "Hold on tightly. I am going to fly at unsafe velocity."

Zeph climbed onto his back without complaint.

Cornelius launched himself upward and angled toward the library with enough acceleration that his passenger made a small sound of alarm.

The city blurred below. Stone buildings. Civic architecture. People conducting normal end-of-day activities completely unaware of the crisis playing out above them.

Photine had money now.

She had passage.

She had approximately one hour before departure.

She would come to the library. Would reverse the petrifications. Would extract her daughter and flee toward the docks.

And Cornelius would give her six hundred additional crowns to ensure she had sufficient resources for emergency contingencies during escape.

The library appeared ahead—familiar architecture, organized courtyards, the roost where he had spent decades believing preservation meant hoarding rather than strategic deployment.

He landed hard and allowed Zeph to dismount.

"What now?" the boy asked.

"Now we wait," Cornelius said. "She will arrive soon. And when she does, we will help her save everyone and escape before the Watch realizes what has happened."

The sun continued its descent toward the horizon.

Time continued running out.

But at least now the equation balanced.

Photine had resources. Cornelius had resources. Combined, they possessed enough to save Demos, restore Melaina, and fund an escape that might actually succeed.

Sometimes preservation required theft.

Sometimes it required selling your hoard.

Sometimes it required standing aside and allowing desperate people to commit crimes in service of keeping their families alive.

Cornelius settled near the library entrance and watched the street.

Waiting.

The game was almost finished.

Just one more move to make.
