# Chapter 15

The Temple Archives smelled of dust and abandonment.

Cornelius landed in the basement corridor with more force than was strictly necessary, his claws scraping against stone worn smooth by decades of foot traffic. The satchel bounced against his side—three hundred gold crowns in physical currency plus Lord Vane's letter of credit. The weight felt wrong. Too heavy. Too cold. Books had mass but they carried it differently, distributed across bound pages with the particular heft of preserved knowledge.

Gold just sat there being expensive.

Behind him, Zeph descended the stairs at a pace that suggested exhaustion despite the boy's youth. They had split from Imelda at the Temple courtyard three minutes earlier. She had continued toward the harbor docks on foot while Cornelius and Zeph diverted here for what Cornelius kept telling himself was a necessary final verification.

"Why are we here?" Zeph leaned against the corridor wall and pushed hair out of his eyes. "I thought we were racing the clock. The Constant Stanza leaves in twenty minutes."

"Nineteen minutes." Cornelius moved toward the Archive chamber door. "And we are here because I realized we have been operating on incomplete information regarding Demos's final activities before his petrification."

"You said you already searched this room. Chapter Two. You found sandalwood and determined petrification mechanics and concluded someone skilled attacked him."

"I searched for evidence of the attack itself. I did not conduct thorough examination of his personal workspace or effects." Cornelius pushed the door open with one claw. "Photine burned documents in her dormitory. Mother Ligeia evacuated the Enclave and left minimal traces. Every actor in this crisis has been destroying evidence systematically."

"So you think Demos might have left something?"

"I think Demos was constitutionally incapable of systematic evidence destruction due to his organic approach to record-keeping." Cornelius entered the Archive chamber and paused.

The room looked exactly as he remembered from his initial investigation. Stone walls. Wooden shelving units holding decades of administrative ledgers. The small desk where Demos had worked on routine filing tasks. And in the corner, carefully covered with protective cloth, the stone figure that had been Brother Demos.

The statue showed him mid-reach toward a shelf, one hand extended for the birth ledger he had been filing when the transformation occurred. His expression remained frozen in that moment of mundane concentration. No fear. No awareness that his biological functions were slowly degrading toward permanent cessation inside unstable petrification.

Cornelius looked away. The statue was evidence and medical emergency simultaneously, and his mind kept trying to catalog it as both categories at once in a way that made his scales prickle with discomfort.

"His desk," Cornelius said. "Search the desk drawers and any personal storage he maintained here. Look for sealed documents, unusual papers, anything that appears deliberately preserved rather than routine filing."

Zeph moved to the desk without argument. The boy had stopped questioning Cornelius's investigative instincts approximately four crimes ago.

Cornelius approached the shelving units and examined the birth ledgers with careful attention. Demos had filed these records regularly as part of Temple administrative duties. The ledgers documented all births occurring under Temple healer supervision—which meant most births in the city, since home births without medical assistance carried significant mortality risk.

Each ledger covered a specific year. The spines showed dates in neat script. The organization was bureaucratically perfect despite Demos's personal chaos.

Cornelius pulled the ledger for the year corresponding to Melaina's age and opened it carefully. The pages showed entries in multiple hands—different healers documenting different births throughout the year. Names, dates, attending healer, any complications, official witness signatures.

He scanned the entries methodically. The Gorgon births were marked with a small notation in the margin—a shorthand symbol that likely corresponded to species designation for record-keeping purposes.

Four Gorgon births that year.

None listed the mother's name as Photine Kallistos.

Cornelius closed the ledger and returned it to its position. The absence was notable but not conclusive. Home births among wealthier families occurred occasionally when mothers preferred privacy. Or the birth could have been registered under false information. Or conducted entirely outside official channels.

"Found something." Zeph's voice carried from the desk. "There is a locked drawer. Bottom left. The lock looks new."

Cornelius moved to examine the desk. Standard Temple furniture—simple wood construction, four drawers on the right side, two larger drawers on the left. The bottom left drawer showed a recently installed lock. The wood around the lock plate was cleaner than surrounding surfaces, suggesting installation within the past few months.

"Can you pick it?" Zeph asked.

"I am a Library Dragon, not a criminal." Cornelius examined the lock mechanism. "However, I possess certain skills that prove useful for accessing restricted archive materials during legitimate research contexts."

"So yes, you can pick it."

"I can manipulate simple mechanical locks using appropriately sized tools." Cornelius extracted two thin claws and inserted them into the lock mechanism. "The distinction is ethically significant even if the practical outcome appears similar."

The lock clicked open.

Cornelius pulled the drawer. Inside lay a small wooden box—the sort used for storing important personal documents. The box was not locked but the lid fit tightly enough to suggest deliberate sealing.

He lifted it out carefully and set it on the desk.

"Should I open it?" Zeph reached toward the lid.

"No. I should open it." Cornelius nudged the boy's hand away with one wing. "If the contents prove legally dangerous, I prefer to maintain plausible deniability regarding your involvement."

"We are literally committing breaking and entering."

"We are conducting emergency investigation under temporal pressure during an active medical crisis." Cornelius opened the box. "The legal distinction will matter if we survive to participate in subsequent judicial proceedings."

The box contained three items.

First: A small leather journal with worn binding. Cornelius opened it to a random page and found Demos's handwriting—the same chaotic notation style from the medical ledger, but these entries appeared personal rather than professional. Journal entries about patients, ethical concerns, resource allocation dilemmas.

Second: A piece of jewelry—a silver chain with a small pendant carved in the shape of a stylized flower. The metalwork was delicate, expensive. Not something a junior healer would typically own on Temple salary.

Third: A sealed scroll tube made of brass with an official-looking wax seal.

Cornelius set the journal and necklace aside and picked up the scroll tube. The brass was cold against his claws. The seal showed the Temple's official mark—the same symbol used on verified birth records and other legal documents.

His scales prickled.

"What is it?" Zeph leaned closer.

"Potentially nothing. Potentially everything." Cornelius examined the seal carefully. Unbroken. Deliberately preserved. The tube itself showed slight tarnish consistent with being stored in a drawer for years rather than weeks.

He rotated it slowly, checking for any additional markings or notations. Nothing. Just the sealed tube and its official stamp.

"Are you going to open it?" Zeph's tone suggested he already knew the answer.

"Opening sealed official documents without authorization constitutes a separate category of legal violation." Cornelius continued holding the tube. "It transforms our current activity from emergency investigation to deliberate evidence tampering."

"But you are going to open it anyway."

"I am attempting to determine whether the potential knowledge value justifies the additional criminal liability." But even as Cornelius said it, he knew he would break the seal. Had to break the seal. Because Demos had locked this away deliberately. Had kept it separate from his other records. Had preserved it with the same care Cornelius applied to rare manuscripts.

Which meant it mattered.

Cornelius broke the seal.

The wax cracked with a sound that felt too loud in the quiet Archive. He pulled the end cap off the tube and extracted the scroll inside—parchment, official thickness, rolled tightly to fit the container.

He unrolled it carefully against the desk surface.

The document was a birth record. Official Temple format. All the proper sections filled out in neat administrative script.

Date of birth.

Location: Temple of Althaia, Private Birthing Room.

Attending healer: Sister Photine Kallistos.

Witness: Brother Demos (signed).

Infant designation: Female, Gorgon, Healthy.

Mother's name: Photine Kallistos.

Father's name: [Declined to State].

Infant name: Melaina.

Cornelius stopped breathing.

The Archive's silence pressed against his eardrums with physical weight. His claws remained precisely positioned holding the scroll edges. His eyes tracked across the text again, slower this time, confirming what he had already read.

Photine Kallistos.

Mother.

Melaina.

Daughter.

The words rearranged his entire understanding of the crisis with the same force as a manuscript revealing itself to contain completely different content than its catalog description suggested.

"What is it?" Zeph's voice came from very far away even though he stood directly beside the desk.

Cornelius could not immediately formulate words. His analytical processes were too occupied with recalculating every interaction, every decision, every desperate action through this new framework.

Photine was not simply a Temple healer treating a patient named Melaina.

She was a mother treating her daughter.

Demos was not simply a colleague covering for unauthorized medical procedures.

He was an uncle protecting his niece. A brother shielding his sister from legal and social consequences that would destroy not just her career but her life.

The sandalwood quarantine soap. The secret petrification procedures. The desperate attempts to halt Melaina's degenerative disease. The careful destruction of evidence. The planned flight on a smuggler ship.

Not criminal activity.

Maternal protection.

"Cornelius?" Zeph touched his wing. "You are doing the thing where you go completely still and it is unsettling."

"Photine is Melaina's mother." Cornelius heard his own voice as though from a distance. "This is an official birth record documenting the delivery seventeen years ago. Photine as attending healer and mother. Demos as witness."

Zeph leaned over the document. Read it. Read it again. Then looked up with an expression that suggested he was also recalculating everything.

"Oh," he said quietly. "Oh no."

"Yes."

"But—Gorgon births to high-status families—" Zeph's voice trailed off.

"Are illegal under civic law if the Gorgon heritage originates from the mother's bloodline rather than consensual partnership." Cornelius continued staring at the document. "The Three Families maintain strict genealogical requirements for inheritance and social standing. A Kallistos bearing a Gorgon child would represent catastrophic family scandal."

"So she hid it."

"She hid it." Cornelius thought of Photine's exhaustion. Her fear. Her obsessive focus on contamination and containment. "For seventeen years, she successfully concealed Melaina's existence. Raised her in secret, likely claiming she was a foundling or ward rather than biological daughter. And Demos knew. Helped. Covered for her throughout his entire time at the Temple."

The relationship between Demos and Photine recontextualized completely. Not simply senior healer and junior colleague. Not mentor and student. Family. Siblings, probably, or close cousins within the Kallistos bloodline who trusted each other enough to maintain this level of conspiracy.

"When Melaina developed the degenerative petrification disease," Cornelius continued, his analytical voice steady despite internal chaos, "Photine could not seek official Temple resources without revealing their relationship. Could not request specialized treatment protocols. Could not even acknowledge her own desperate motivation for saving this one specific patient."

"So she did it all secretly. The quarantine soap. The experimental procedures. The petrification preservation." Zeph's hands were shaking slightly. "She was trying to save her daughter and could not tell anyone why that patient mattered so much."

"And Demos supported her. Channeled Temple resources to help. Probably conducted his own research into treatment options." Cornelius thought of the medical ledger. The careful tracking of fever cases and progression patterns. "When Melaina's condition worsened beyond any known cure, Photine made the choice to petrify her—to lock her daughter into magical stasis rather than watch her die."

The tragedy of it assembled with terrible elegance.

Photine preserving Melaina in stone because that was the only form of preservation available.

Demos protecting both of them despite the professional and legal risks.

And when Demos himself contracted the same degenerative condition—probably from exposure during treatment procedures—Photine had likely attempted the same preservation transformation.

But something had gone wrong.

The petrification was incomplete. Unstable. Demos was dying inside stone while Melaina remained in perfect stasis.

"Why is this document here?" Zeph asked quietly. "Why did Demos keep it?"

Cornelius examined the scroll again. The parchment was expensive. The calligraphy was formal. The seal had been official Temple administration rather than simple healer notation.

"This should have been filed in the birth ledger we examined." Cornelius gestured toward the shelving units. "Official records are meant to be publicly accessible for genealogical verification and legal proceedings. But Demos witnessed this birth and immediately removed the documentation from official filing."

"To protect Photine."

"To protect the entire family. If this record existed in public archives, anyone conducting Kallistos genealogical research would discover Photine bore a Gorgon child. The scandal would destroy her standing, revoke her Temple position, and likely result in criminal prosecution under genealogical fraud statutes." Cornelius looked at the locked drawer. "Demos locked this away seventeen years ago and maintained the secret ever since."

The weight of that duration pressed against Cornelius's awareness. Seventeen years of careful deception. Of maintaining false records. Of ensuring that this one document never surfaced during routine archive access.

Seventeen years of Demos choosing his family over institutional procedure.

"What do we do with it?" Zeph's voice was barely audible. "If the Watch finds this during their investigation—"

"Captain Theo would be legally obligated to arrest Photine for genealogical fraud, unlawful birth concealment, and conspiracy to falsify Temple records." Cornelius carefully rolled the scroll closed. "The charges carry mandatory prosecution regardless of circumstances or motivation."

"She would be executed."

"The penalty for genealogical fraud at Photine's social status is exile or execution depending on judicial discretion and family political maneuvering." Cornelius held the scroll between his claws. "Given current political tensions regarding Gorgon rights and the Three Families' influence on civic governance, execution remains plausible."

They stood in silence. The Archive's dust-filled air pressed close. In the corner, Demos's statue maintained its frozen reach toward ledgers he would never file without reversal that depended entirely on Photine's survival and cooperation.

Cornelius looked at the document.

Looked at the covered statue.

Looked at the satchel containing six hundred gold crowns obtained by selling his most precious possession.

The equation was not complicated.

If he preserved this document and provided it to Watch authorities, Photine would be arrested and prosecuted. Demos would die without reversal. Melaina would remain stone permanently. And the legal system would congratulate itself for maintaining genealogical standards regardless of the cost in actual human lives.

If he destroyed the document, he eliminated the primary evidence of Photine's crime. The Watch could suspect. The families could gossip. But without official birth records, prosecution became legally fragile.

And Photine could potentially survive to reverse the petrifications and flee the city with her daughter.

Cornelius had spent one hundred and twenty-seven years preserving documents.

Protecting knowledge.

Cataloging truth.

He walked to the nearest oil lamp and turned up the wick until flame brightened against the glass.

"What are you doing?" Zeph's tone suggested he already knew.

"I am applying lessons learned from recent resource allocation decisions." Cornelius held the scroll over the lamp flame. "Sometimes preservation requires destroying evidence."

"That is an official Temple document. Burning it is—"

"Another crime to add to our expanding list of legal violations conducted in service of keeping people alive." Cornelius watched the parchment edge blacken. "I recently sold the Founder's annotated Chronicles to fund smuggler passage. Comparatively, document destruction feels like minor additional liability."

The flame caught the scroll's edge. Expensive parchment burned differently than cheap paper—slower, with less smoke, producing ash that maintained structural integrity longer before collapsing.

Cornelius held it steady and watched Photine Kallistos's name blacken and curl.

Watched Melaina's birth record reduce to carbon.

Watched seventeen years of dangerous truth transform into ash that could not testify in judicial proceedings.

The heat prickled against his claws but he maintained position until the entire scroll was consumed. Then he released the final fragments to fall into the lamp's catch-basin where they dissolved into anonymous residue.

"We just destroyed evidence in an active Watch investigation," Zeph said quietly.

"We destroyed documentation of a secret that would result in multiple executions and prevent medical reversal of petrification affecting three people." Cornelius closed the lamp's glass panel. "The moral mathematics seem straightforward."

"Theo will know something is missing. He inventoried Demos's desk contents. If there was a locked drawer and now it is empty—"

"Then he will suspect Demos maintained personal secrets and we removed them." Cornelius returned to the desk and picked up the leather journal and silver necklace. "Which is accurate. But suspicion without evidence cannot sustain prosecution."

He secured both items in his satchel alongside the gold crowns. The journal might contain additional dangerous information. The necklace appeared to be a gift—possibly from Photine to Demos or vice versa. Family connection items that would raise questions if discovered during Watch searches.

Better to remove them entirely.

Zeph watched him work. "You are getting very comfortable with crime."

"I am expanding my understanding of which rules deserve preservation and which rules deserve destruction." Cornelius closed the satchel and secured the straps. "Imelda suggested I was finally growing up. Apparently maturation involves recognizing that perfect record-keeping is less important than preventing preventable deaths."

"Demos sold his grave to buy medicine. You sold your hoard to buy passage. Now you are burning evidence to protect a family." Zeph's expression showed something that might have been pride. "You are learning."

"I am applying inconsistent ethical frameworks in response to immediate crisis pressure." But Cornelius felt the truth beneath his deflection. He was choosing. People over procedure. Lives over law. Messy human needs over clean institutional order.

And it felt correct in a way that made his previous century of rigid preservation seem hollow.

He moved toward the door. "We need to reach the harbor. Imelda will be coordinating with dock officials. The Constant Stanza will attempt departure regardless of whether we arrive in time."

Zeph followed. They climbed the stairs together—dragon and human adolescent, both carrying more secrets than their species and ages typically accumulated.

At the top of the stairs, Cornelius paused and looked back at the Archive entrance.

Somewhere below, Demos remained frozen. Dying slowly. Unaware that his final secret was now ash and that his survival depended on three criminals conducting increasingly desperate rescue operations.

"We will save him," Zeph said quietly.

"We will try." Cornelius spread his wings. "Which is apparently the lesson everyone has been attempting to teach me. Trying matters even when success is not guaranteed."

They exited into the Temple courtyard. The afternoon bells marked the hour—four chimes indicating they had approximately twelve minutes before fifth bell and the Constant Stanza's scheduled departure.

Twelve minutes to reach the harbor.

Locate a smuggler ship in a district full of vessels.

Find Photine before she was arrested or abandoned.

Convince her to reverse three separate petrifications.

And do it all while carrying six hundred gold crowns, one dead healer's journal, one incriminating necklace, and the knowledge that they had just destroyed evidence that might have saved them if everything went wrong.

The equation was not favorable.

But Cornelius launched himself toward the harbor anyway.

Behind him, Zeph ran to catch up.

The game was not finished.

And they had already spent too much to quit now.
