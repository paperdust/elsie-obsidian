# Chapter 10

Cornelius did not enter through Photine's window.

He should have. The investigation required direct confrontation with the Temple healer, and Photine had explicitly invited him inside to discuss "what she had done." Every investigative protocol indicated this was the critical moment for extracting confession and clarifying motive.

But something in her voice stopped him.

Not fear. Not defiance. Something closer to resignation laced with desperate hope, as though she believed Cornelius already understood and had come to provide absolution rather than accusation.

Which meant she expected him to know something he did not yet know.

Cornelius stepped back from the window ledge. "I need to verify one detail first. I will return shortly."

Photine's expression did not change. "She is beautiful, is she not? Even like this."

"I do not—"

"You will." Photine closed the window gently, as though sealing a tomb rather than dismissing a visitor. The lamplight behind her extinguished.

Cornelius launched himself from the Temple wall, wings catching the cool night air with the particular snap that indicated agitation rather than controlled flight. The city spread below him in layers of stone and shadow—civic quarter's organized architecture giving way to the residential chaos and eventually the warehouse districts where he had confronted Xanthe.

Somewhere in that layered complexity, the truth waited.

But first, he needed to check on Melaina.

The library rose solid against the civic quarter's eastern edge, lamplight filtering through high windows where Zeph was maintaining watch over the archive. Cornelius angled toward the dome and descended to his private entrance—a reinforced window designed to accommodate draconic dimensions without requiring main door protocols.

The building smelled of old paper and lamp oil and the particular mustiness that no amount of cleaning entirely eliminated from stone foundations. Safe. Familiar. Organized according to systems Cornelius himself had implemented over decades of fastidious curation.

He folded his wings and moved through the administrative corridor toward the archive access. His claws clicked against stone floors with the rhythmic precision that usually provided comfort through predictability.

Tonight, the sound felt too loud. Too isolated.

Zeph appeared at the corridor's junction, moving quickly enough to suggest urgency but not quite running. His face showed the particular combination of worry and confusion that typically preceded requests for Cornelius to fix problems beyond standard library operations.

"You are back." Zeph's voice carried relief. "I was about to send Niko to find you."

"Why? Has Melaina's condition changed?"

"I do not know. Maybe. Probably." Zeph gestured toward the archive stairs. "Niko came to get me about twenty minutes ago. Said Melaina was acting strange. Breathing differently or something. I went down to check but the archive door is locked and I cannot find the key anywhere."

Cornelius went very still. "The archive door does not lock. It has never required locking because it is already secured behind three levels of restricted access."

"Well, it is locked now. And Niko is still inside with Melaina and he is not answering when I knock." Zeph was fidgeting with his sleeve, pulling at threads. "I thought maybe you had installed new security protocols or something. But you were gone and Imelda does not know anything about archive modifications and I did not want to break down the door without checking first."

The prickling sensation across Cornelius's scales intensified. He moved past Zeph toward the archive stairs, descending quickly enough that his claws sparked against stone edges.

The archive occupied the library's oldest section—stone chambers built during the city's founding that predated current civic architecture by at least two centuries. Cornelius maintained climate control through a combination of magical regulation and carefully designed ventilation. The temperature remained constant. The humidity stayed within acceptable preservation parameters.

The door should not lock.

He reached the archive entrance and found exactly what Zeph had described. The heavy oak door sat firmly closed, the latch engaged from the inside. Cornelius tested it. Solid. Immovable without applying force that would damage historical wood.

"Niko?" He pitched his voice to carry through the door. "This is Cornelius. I need you to open the door."

Silence.

"Niko, if Melaina's condition has deteriorated, I require immediate access to assess treatment options."

No response. No footsteps. No indication anyone inside heard or intended to respond.

Zeph pressed closer. "See? He has been ignoring me for fifteen minutes. I tried everything short of breaking the door."

Cornelius examined the latch mechanism. Standard sliding bolt, operated from either side. Currently engaged from within. Not locked in the traditional sense but effectively securing the space against external entry.

Which meant either Niko had deliberately barricaded them inside, or someone else had locked them in.

Or something had prevented both of them from responding.

The knowledge settled in Cornelius's chest like ice.

"Stand back," he said.

Zeph retreated three steps. Cornelius braced his shoulder against the door and pushed. The wood groaned. The hinges protested. The bolt held for approximately four seconds before the internal mechanism fractured and the door swung inward with a crack that echoed through the archive chambers.

The space beyond was dark except for a single lamp that Niko must have left burning on the reading table. Its light caught the edges of shelves and cast long shadows across floor tiles that Cornelius himself had cleaned just two days prior.

Everything appeared normal.

Except for the complete absence of movement or sound from living occupants.

Cornelius entered slowly, wings half-spread for balance. His vision adjusted to the lamplight, cataloging details. Books remained properly shelved. No signs of struggle or disturbance. The climate control hummed quietly, maintaining optimal preservation conditions.

Niko sat in the reading chair near the lamp.

Not sat.

Occupied the chair in the position sitting required. But without the subtle movements that distinguished living stillness from complete immobility.

His skin had the particular smooth uniformity that suggested stone rather than flesh. His eyes remained open, focused on something across the room. His hands rested on the chair arms with fingers slightly curled as though he had been mid-gesture when the transformation occurred.

Petrified.

Cornelius approached carefully and examined the statue without touching it. The details were extraordinary—individual hairs rendered in stone, fabric textures preserved perfectly, even the faint lines around Niko's eyes captured with sculptural precision.

This was not the rough, uneven petrification of an interrupted transformation or failed reversal.

This was complete. Deliberate. Executed with enough skill and control to preserve every detail.

"Is he—" Zeph's voice came from the doorway. Small. Uncertain.

"Petrified. Completely." Cornelius moved around the statue, analyzing the magical residue. It clung to the stone like morning dew, faint but present. The same signature he had detected on Demos.

But stronger. More stable. Less like an interrupted process and more like a finished work.

"Can you reverse it?"

"That depends on whether the original caster is available and willing to cooperate." Cornelius straightened and looked in the direction Niko's stone eyes focused.

Toward the corner where Melaina had been resting on her cushion nest.

Where a second statue now occupied the space.

Cornelius's breath stopped.

He crossed the archive floor in four strides, lamp-light catching the edges of his scales as he moved. The statue sat exactly where Melaina had been when Cornelius left to confront Xanthe. Same position. Same basic posture.

But transformed completely to grey stone.

She looked smaller somehow. Fragile. Her hands rested in her lap, fingers loosely intertwined. Her serpent hair coiled around her shoulders in patterns that suggested recent movement frozen mid-flow. Her eyes were closed, giving the impression of peaceful sleep rather than violent assault.

Her feet were completely stone. Solid grey from toes to ankles, the transformation that Zeph had described as gradual progression now fully manifested and extending upward into her legs.

Cornelius reached out and touched her shoulder.

Stone. Cold. Solid.

The temperature was wrong. Not the chill of death but the absolute neutrality of mineral composition. His claw-tips registered texture—smooth where her skin had been, slightly rougher where fabric creased.

He moved his hand to her throat and felt for the faint vibration that had indicated Demos's continued biological function beneath the petrification.

Nothing.

No pulse. No breath. No subtle indication that living processes continued beneath the surface.

Just stone.

Zeph made a small, broken sound behind him. "She is dead."

"Petrified." Cornelius withdrew his hand. "The distinction is important."

"How? You just said there is no—" Zeph stopped. Swallowed. Tried again with a voice that shook slightly. "There is no pulse. No breathing. That means dead."

"That means transformed. Whether the transformation is reversible depends on understanding its purpose and mechanics." Cornelius moved to examine Melaina's statue from different angles. The lamplight caught subtle variations in the stone's surface—smoother at her extremities, slightly more textured at her torso.

Old versus new petrification.

The disease's gradual progression layered beneath complete magical transformation.

Like preserving a partially-damaged manuscript by encasing it in protective crystal.

Cornelius went very still.

Preservation.

He straightened and inhaled deeply through his nose, activating the scent-analysis capability that most dragons possessed but he rarely deployed outside of identifying deteriorating paper or pest infestations.

The archive smelled of stone and old books and lamp oil.

And sandalwood.

Strong. Fresh. Pervasive.

Not the faint trace he had detected at Demos's crime scene or the subtle undertone that clung to Melaina's clothing from the quarantine soap.

This was recent application. Concentrated. Deliberate.

Someone had been here within the last hour and had brought sandalwood-preserved supplies or tools.

Someone who had petrified both Melaina and Niko with enough skill to create complete, stable transformations rather than the interrupted partial petrification that suggested assault or accident.

Cornelius returned to Niko's statue and examined it more carefully. The shapeshifter's expression showed surprise but not terror. His body language suggested he had stood from the chair and turned to face someone, mid-sentence, when the transformation occurred.

Fast enough that he could not defend himself.

Controlled enough that the petrification took him completely rather than leaving him partially transformed.

Which meant either:

Someone had attacked them both with extraordinary magical capability.

Or someone they trusted had transformed them deliberately while they were unaware of the threat.

The sandalwood scent was strongest near Melaina's statue.

Cornelius lowered his head and inhaled again, isolating components. Sandalwood base. Herbal undertones that suggested the quarantine soap composition. And beneath that, something else.

The faint chemical residue of preservation magic actively maintaining stasis.

Not death magic. Not assault magic.

Medical intervention.

The realization assembled itself with terrible clarity.

"This was not an attack," Cornelius said quietly.

Zeph moved closer, still maintaining careful distance from both statues. "What do you mean, not an attack? Someone turned them both to stone."

"Someone transformed them using the same controlled petrification magic that transformed Brother Demos. With the same signature. The same precise technique." Cornelius traced the air near Melaina's statue without touching it, mapping the magical residue. "And someone brought sandalwood quarantine supplies here recently, which suggests medical purpose rather than criminal intent."

"You think a healer did this?"

"I think Sister Photine did this." The words felt strange forming. Wrong. But simultaneously correct in the way that solving particularly difficult archival puzzles felt correct. "She withdrew ten cases of Sandalwood Quarantine Soap three weeks ago. She has been treating someone in isolation. She knew about Demos's charity network and his investigation of fever patterns."

"Okay, so Photine is the one who petrified Demos. We suspected that already." Zeph's voice had taken on the particular tone that suggested he was following the logic but disliking where it led. "But why would she petrify Melaina? And Niko?"

Cornelius looked at Melaina's statue. At her stone hands folded peacefully in her lap. At her closed eyes and slightly parted lips that suggested exhalation frozen mid-breath.

At her feet that had been slowly transforming to stone for weeks as the degenerative illness progressed.

"Because Melaina was dying," he said. The realization felt like watching puzzle pieces click into place with such perfect alignment that previous configurations became impossible to imagine. "Demos's notes documented progressive petrification. Treatments failing. Experimental protocols proving ineffective. The disease was advancing."

"So Photine petrified her to—what? Put her out of her misery?"

"To preserve her. To halt biological processes before the disease killed her completely." Cornelius moved back to examine the statue's base where it met the stone floor. "Petrification suspends all bodily functions. No breathing. No heartbeat. No cellular activity. Which means no disease progression."

The silence stretched between them. Beyond the archive walls, the library settled into its night-time patterns. Distant sounds of the city conducting evening routines filtered through stone foundations—Watch bells marking patrol shifts, late carriages rattling over cobblestones, the particular quiet that descended when most citizens retired to private spaces.

Normal civic function while they stood in a hidden chamber examining two people transformed to stone through what might have been desperate medical intervention rather than criminal assault.

"You are saying this is treatment," Zeph said finally. His voice had gone very small. "You are saying Photine turned Melaina to stone to save her life."

"I am saying Photine transformed Melaina to prevent her death. Whether that constitutes salvation or simply prolonged suspension remains to be determined based on whether reversal is possible." Cornelius examined his own claws, scales prickling with the discomfort of paradigm shifts. "We have been investigating murder. We should have been investigating triage."

"That does not make sense. You cannot triage someone by petrifying them."

"You can if petrification is the only method available to halt disease progression while seeking treatment." Cornelius turned to examine Niko's statue again. "Demos's final ledger entry mentioned Temple leadership involvement despite risks to patient safety and family reputation. Photine is Temple leadership. Photine is also Kallistos family."

"So?"

"So Mother Ligeia's message said 'the Flower is wilting. Tell the Healer. She knows what must be done but fears the cost.'" Cornelius moved back toward Melaina's statue. "This is what Ligeia meant. Photine knew how to halt Melaina's deterioration. But the cost was transforming her to stone without certainty that reversal would be possible."

Zeph made a sound like something breaking. "Melaina is the Flower."

"Melaina is one flower. I suspect there is another patient. Someone Photine has been treating in isolation. Someone whose illness threatened family reputation badly enough to require absolute secrecy despite medical ethics and institutional protocols."

"Who?"

"I do not know. But whoever they are, their connection to Photine is close enough that she risked professional destruction to keep them alive." Cornelius adjusted his spectacles. "And when Demos discovered the pattern and attempted to document it properly through Temple channels, she petrified him to prevent exposure."

The archive felt too small. Too quiet. The lamplight threw shadows that made the statues look almost alive—the illusion of movement created by flickering flame against carved stone.

Except these were not carvings.

They were people.

People who might still be saved if the spell could be reversed.

People who had been deliberately transformed by someone who believed this was the only option available.

Cornelius thought of Photine's bleeding hands. Her obsessive cleaning protocols. Her terror when he mentioned sandalwood preservation.

Her exhausted eyes and mechanical competence barely concealing psychological collapse.

She was not a killer.

She was a desperate healer managing impossible triage with inadequate resources and no institutional support.

She was doing exactly what Demos had done—providing care the Temple's official policies prohibited, sacrificing professional standing and personal stability to keep patients alive through whatever means available.

She was trying to save lives using the only tool that could halt the disease's progression while she searched for actual treatment.

And Cornelius had been investigating her as a murderer.

"We need to find Photine," Cornelius said. His voice sounded strange even to himself. "Immediately. Before the Watch locates her first."

"Why would the Watch—" Zeph stopped. Understanding spread across his face like shadow. "They will think she murdered Demos. And if they find Melaina and Niko like this, they will think she murdered them too."

"They will arrest her. They will demand reversal under interrogation. And if she refuses or cannot reverse the transformations fast enough, they will charge her with multiple murders and criminal negligence." Cornelius turned toward the door. "Captain Theo will execute whatever legal protocols allow the fastest resolution to protect Watch authority and civic order."

Which meant Photine would be detained. Possibly executed if the Council determined her actions constituted criminal assault rather than medical intervention.

Which meant Melaina and potentially Demos would remain stone permanently.

Which meant everyone involved would die or remain petrified because the investigation had categorized desperate mercy as deliberate violence.

Cornelius reached the archive door and stopped.

Photine had said she expected him.

She had said they needed to discuss what she had done.

She had closed her window and extinguished her lamp.

As though preparing to disappear rather than wait for his return.

"She knew I would discover this," Cornelius said. "She understood I would examine Melaina and recognize the medical signature. She anticipated that I would reach the correct conclusion."

"So where is she now?"

Cornelius looked back at Melaina's statue. At the peaceful expression and carefully folded hands. At the precise, controlled transformation that preserved every detail with sculptural care.

Treatment, not assault.

Desperate intervention, not calculated violence.

A healer doing what healers do when all authorized options fail and patients continue dying.

"She is hiding," Cornelius said quietly. "Or running. Or possibly preparing to reverse the transformations if she believes I have deduced her motives accurately enough to help rather than condemn."

"How do we find her?"

"We do not. We go to the one person who might know where Photine would seek sanctuary when facing institutional collapse and criminal prosecution."

Zeph's eyes widened. "Mother Ligeia."

"Mother Ligeia. Who sent the original message about the wilting Flower. Who knew Photine was treating Melaina. Who directed Melaina to my archive for protection." Cornelius spread his wings. "Who may have been coordinating with Photine to manage this outbreak without Temple leadership or Watch interference."

He moved toward the stairs, claws clicking against stone with renewed purpose. Behind him, the archive remained quiet except for the lamp's steady flame and the absolute stillness of two people preserved in stone.

Preserved.

Not killed.

The distinction mattered.

Cornelius just needed to make certain Captain Theo and the Watch understood that distinction before they arrested the only person capable of reversing the transformations.
