# Chapter 9

The fish market safehouse smelled of brine and old wood. Cornelius adjusted his spectacles and regretted every decision that had led him to this particular location.

The building occupied a narrow space between a gutted warehouse and what appeared to be either a very small residence or a very large storage shed. Access required navigating a maze of rotting crates and fishing equipment that someone had optimistically labeled as "temporary storage" approximately three years ago based on the deterioration patterns.

Cornelius had followed Xanthe here after watching her leave the Enclave through a secondary exit—a narrow drainage passage that emptied into the warehouse district. She had moved quickly, checking for Watch patrols with the practiced efficiency of someone who expected surveillance.

She had not expected aerial pursuit.

Cornelius landed on the warehouse roof and folded his wings. Below him, lamplight filtered through gaps in the safehouse walls. Voices carried through the inadequate insulation—multiple speakers, possibly four or five people conducting what sounded like strategic planning rather than casual conversation.

He descended to ground level and approached the door. It was locked, which was reasonable. It was also constructed from scavenged planks that varied in thickness and quality, which suggested the lock was more symbolic than functional.

Cornelius knocked.

The conversation inside stopped immediately. Footsteps approached. The door opened six inches, revealing Xanthe's face and a knife positioned at approximately throat height for human visitors.

She lowered the knife when she recognized him. "You followed me."

"Your exit route was insufficiently concealed for someone attempting covert movement."

"Or maybe I wanted you to follow me. Maybe I am tired of waiting for the Watch to drag me into interrogation again." She stepped back and opened the door wider. "Come in, Librarian. Let us have this conversation before Theo decides to skip formalities and move straight to detention."

Cornelius entered. The interior matched external impressions—minimal furniture, maximum strategic positioning. Three other Gorgons occupied the space, all younger than Xanthe, all armed with improvised weapons ranging from sharpened tools to what appeared to be actual military-grade short swords.

They watched Cornelius with the particular wariness of people prepared to defend themselves but hoping they would not need to.

"Out," Xanthe said to them. "Take watch positions. Whistle pattern if Watch approaches."

They departed silently. Xanthe closed the door and gestured toward a bench that looked structurally questionable. "Sit if you want. Or stand if you prefer maintaining dragon superiority."

Cornelius remained standing. "I require clarification regarding your movements on the night Brother Demos was petrified."

"I already told Theo. I was home. With my cousin. Who was dying of fever because your Temple decided her life was not worth the cost of medicine." Xanthe's serpent hair coiled tight. "You want more detail? I was changing fever-soaked sheets. I was forcing water down her throat because she was too weak to drink on her own. I was listening to her beg for help while knowing the Temple would not send anyone unless we could pay fees we did not have."

"Your alibi depends entirely on testimony from someone who was critically ill and possibly unconscious."

"My alibi depends on truth. Whether you believe it is your problem, not mine." She leaned against the wall, knife still visible in her hand. "Why are you really here, Cornelius Drake? You already decided I am guilty. Theo decided before he even asked questions. The Watch has decided collectively. What difference does my answer make?"

Cornelius opened the satchel he carried and withdrew Demos's ledger. He placed it on the table between them. "Because Brother Demos kept records. Incomplete records. Chaotic records. But records nonetheless."

Xanthe's expression did not change. She looked at the ledger without moving closer. "Where did you get that?"

"From Temple administrative storage. Without authorization. Which constitutes theft, making us both criminals now." He opened the ledger to the charity distribution section. "Demos documented his unauthorized medical network. Including treatments provided to Gorgon Quarter residents. Including, I believe, treatments provided to your cousin."

Xanthe moved forward despite herself. She looked at the pages, her serpent hair orienting toward the writing as though she could extract meaning through proximity. "What does it say?"

"That Brother Demos treated your cousin four times over the past two months. That he provided fever treatments, pain management, and experimental protocols when standard medicines failed." Cornelius traced one entry. "That he returned three days before his petrification and noted that her condition was deteriorating despite all interventions."

Xanthe's hand tightened on her knife. "He came back. After the argument in the square. After I accused him of murder through neglect. He came back."

"He came back because you were correct. Your cousin needed treatment. The fact that he could not provide it through official channels did not mean he would abandon her to suffer untreated."

"Then why refuse me in the square? Why make me beg in front of witnesses while pretending he could not help?" Her voice cracked. "Why humiliate me if he planned to help anyway?"

"Because the Temple was collapsing financially. Because Photine was monitoring his movements. Because admitting publicly that he was treating patients without documentation would have ended his ability to help anyone." Cornelius closed the ledger. "He performed cruelty publicly to maintain capacity for mercy privately. You hated him for theater while he was actively saving your cousin's life in secret."

Xanthe stared at the ledger. Her knife lowered slowly. "I called him a murderer."

"You called him what the situation appeared to warrant based on available information. Your anger was justified by systemic triage policies that prioritize wealth over need."

"But he was not enforcing those policies. He was undermining them." She set the knife on the table. Her hands were shaking. "I wanted him dead. I wanted whoever refused to treat her to suffer the way she was suffering. I wanted—"

She stopped. Her serpent hair coiled so tight it looked painful.

Cornelius watched her carefully. "You wanted revenge. That is understandable. The question is whether you acted on that desire."

"I wanted to act on it. I thought about it constantly. I imagined walking into the Temple and forcing them to watch her die since they would not help prevent it." Xanthe's voice had gone flat. "But I did not actually do anything. I went home. I took care of my cousin. I changed her sheets and forced medicine down her throat and pretended I had any control over whether she lived or died."

"Where did you obtain the medicine if the Temple would not provide it?"

"Mother Ligeia. She has supplies from—from sources. Enclave sources. Not Temple-sanctioned but effective enough to manage pain." Xanthe looked up. "You think I petrified Demos. You think I followed him to the Archives and turned him to stone as punishment for refusing public treatment."

"I think someone with motive, opportunity, and capability is generally the statistical favorite in assault investigations."

"Then arrest me. Bring Theo and his guards and drag me to detention. Add me to whatever list he is building for mass roundups." She spread her hands, displaying empty palms. "I hated Demos. I hate the Temple. I hate the Three Families and their donation politics and the entire system that treats my people as disposable. But I did not petrify anyone."

Cornelius studied her. The anger was real. Raw and immediate, like fresh wounds rather than calculated performance. It radiated from her in waves—the kind of fury that demanded immediate expression rather than patient planning.

Xanthe was a blade, not a poison.

She would confront directly, publicly, with witnesses. She would attack in the square during arguments, not in archives during quiet filing work.

She lacked the cold discipline required for the kind of controlled magic that had petrified Demos.

"I believe you," Cornelius said.

Xanthe blinked. "What?"

"I believe you did not petrify Brother Demos. Your anger is too visible. Too immediate. Too honest." He returned the ledger to his satchel. "The petrification required sustained focus and deliberate magical channeling. It required patience and planning. It required someone capable of appearing harmless while executing precise violence."

"So I am too angry to be a good criminal?"

"You are too angry to be a calculating one. Which eliminates you from primary suspect status despite Captain Theo's procedural preferences."

Xanthe laughed, but it sounded more like pain than humor. "That is the strangest vindication I have ever received."

"I am not vindicating you. I am eliminating you from the suspect pool through behavioral analysis." Cornelius moved toward the door. "But you should know that Demos's ledger shows he treated your cousin until his final conscious night. Whatever happens to her now, it will not be because he abandoned her."

"It will be because the system killed him before he could finish saving her."

"Possibly. I am still determining which system and who specifically operated its mechanisms."

He left before Xanthe could respond. Outside, the warehouse district stretched dark and quiet except for distant Watch patrol bells enforcing curfew protocols.

Cornelius launched himself skyward and oriented toward the library. Below him, the city organized itself into familiar patterns—civic quarter's ordered stone, residential neighborhoods' chaotic growth, the Enclave's hidden cistern entrances barely visible as darker shadows against dark streets.

If not Xanthe, then who?

Someone with capability and motive.

Someone calm enough to channel petrification magic with surgical precision.

Someone who benefited from Demos's silence.

Kyra Kallistos.

The profile assembled itself with uncomfortable clarity. Wealthy Gorgon from a reputation-conscious family. Visited Photine repeatedly at odd hours. Present at the Temple the night of Demos's petrification. Invested in maintaining social status through careful identity management.

Someone who would fear exposure more than direct confrontation.

Someone who would plan rather than react.

Someone who needed Demos silenced before he revealed something that threatened family reputation.

Cornelius adjusted his flight path and descended toward the library's dome. The building rose solid and permanent against the civic quarter's organized architecture, lamplight filtering through high windows where Zeph was probably avoiding closing procedures.

He landed on the entrance steps and entered through the main doors. The library smelled of paper and lamp oil and the particular mustiness that accumulated in old buildings despite regular cleaning.

Safe. Organized. Comprehensible.

Everything the investigation was not.

Zeph looked up from the circulation desk where he was ostensibly sorting returned materials but actually appeared to be constructing some kind of architectural sculpture from stacked books.

"You are back." Zeph abandoned his construction project. "Did you find Xanthe? Did she confess to petrifying Demos in dramatic fashion while cackling about revenge?"

"She confessed to wanting revenge but denying action. Her anger profile is inconsistent with premeditated assault." Cornelius moved past the desk toward his study. "I am refocusing investigation on Kyra Kallistos. She possesses stronger motive and demonstrates personality characteristics more consistent with calculated violence."

"Kyra?" Zeph followed. "The fancy Gorgon who keeps visiting Photine?"

"The same. She has means, motive, and access. She also benefits from maintaining secrecy regarding whatever medical situation required repeated private consultations with Temple healers."

"So you think she petrified Demos to prevent him from revealing she was sick? Or getting treatment? Or—" Zeph stopped walking. "Wait. That does not make sense. Why would being sick make her attack someone?"

"Because the nature of the illness matters more than the illness itself. If Kyra suffers from something that threatens family reputation, exposure would destroy her social standing." Cornelius entered his study and set down his satchel. "Particularly if that illness connected her to Gorgon community issues the Kallistos family prefers to distance themselves from publicly."

Zeph leaned against the doorframe. He had developed the particular expression that suggested he possessed information but was calculating whether sharing it would create additional problems.

Cornelius recognized that expression. "What have you discovered?"

"Maybe nothing. Probably nothing." Zeph picked at a loose thread on his sleeve. "But I was checking on Melaina earlier. Bringing her water and bread. Normal caretaking supervision."

"And?"

"And she smells like that soap. The sandalwood stuff. Really strongly, like someone just washed her with it." Zeph's voice had gone quiet. "Niko said Mother Ligeia had been using special soap to keep her clean. To prevent infection or contamination or something."

The connection formed immediately. Sandalwood Quarantine Soap. The same supplies Photine had withdrawn from Temple reserves. The same scent that had marked the crime scene.

"That is concerning but not surprising," Cornelius said. "Quarantine protocols would explain the soap usage if treating infectious illness."

"Yeah. About that." Zeph was not meeting his eyes now. "Her feet. They are turning to stone. Like, actually stone. Niko showed me. The transformation started at her toes and it is spreading slowly upward. She cannot walk anymore because her feet do not bend."

Cornelius went absolutely still.

"What?"

"She is petrifying. Like Demos. Except slower. Way slower." Zeph finally looked up. "Niko said it has been happening gradually over weeks. That Mother Ligeia tried everything to stop it but nothing worked. That Demos was the only healer who took her seriously instead of just assuming someone attacked her."

The study walls felt too close. Cornelius moved to his desk and gripped the edge, scales prickling with the particular sensation that accompanied fundamental paradigm shifts.

Petrification as symptom.

Not assault. Not intentional violence.

Disease.

"Demos's notes," Cornelius said. "Patient M. Progressive petrification. Degenerative Gorgon condition. Standard treatments ineffective."

"That was Melaina?"

"That was Melaina. He was documenting her condition as medical phenomenon rather than criminal assault." Cornelius opened the ledger with shaking claws. "He was investigating fever patterns. Persistent illness resistant to treatment. Progressive magical deterioration."

"You think it is contagious?"

"I think Photine withdrew quarantine supplies for a reason. I think Demos was tracking multiple patients with similar symptoms. I think—" He stopped. Read the final entry again. "I think there is another patient. Someone Photine is treating in isolation. Someone whose condition requires absolute secrecy."

*The Flower is wilting. Tell the Healer. She knows what must be done but fears the cost.*

Two flowers.

Two patients.

Both petrifying slowly from degenerative illness rather than deliberate attack.

Both requiring quarantine protocols and secret treatment.

Both threatening reputation and stability if exposed.

"Demos was not attacked," Cornelius said. The words felt strange forming. "He was infected."

Zeph made a small sound. "Infected with what?"

"With whatever is turning Melaina to stone. With whatever the Temple is concealing through medical triage and resource restriction. With whatever Photine fears badly enough to cause psychological breakdown." Cornelius closed the ledger. "We have been investigating murder. We should have been investigating plague."

The silence stretched between them. Beyond the study, the library conducted its peaceful evening closure—lamps dimming, doors locking, the building settling into comfortable night routine.

While in the hidden archive below, a child slowly transformed into permanent stone.

While in the Temple, Demos remained frozen mid-gesture.

While somewhere in the city, another patient suffered the same progressive petrification.

And they had approximately forty hours remaining before Demos's condition became irreversible.

"What do we do?" Zeph's voice had gone very small.

Cornelius looked at the ledger. At the quarantine soap inventory records. At Ligeia's message with its desperate encoded plea.

*She knows what must be done but fears the cost.*

"We find Photine," Cornelius said. "We make her explain what she is hiding. And we discover whether Demos can be saved or if we are simply documenting another casualty of whatever is killing Melaina."

He moved toward the door. Zeph followed.

"Should I come with you?"

"No. Stay with Melaina. Monitor her condition. If the petrification accelerates, send for me immediately." Cornelius paused. "And Zeph? Do not let anyone else near her. Not Watch. Not Temple officials. Not anyone who might interpret her condition as criminal rather than medical."

"You think they would arrest her for being sick?"

"I think they would arrest her for being Gorgon and stone-touched during a period when the Watch requires convenient suspects." Cornelius spread his wings. "Keep her safe. I will return with answers."

He launched himself into the night air, leaving Zeph standing in the study doorway looking smaller and younger than sixteen should look.

The flight to the Temple took minutes. Cornelius descended toward the healer's wing, oriented toward the private quarters where senior staff maintained residence during active duty rotations.

Photine's window showed lamplight.

She was still awake.

Still working.

Still maintaining whatever desperate isolation protocol was slowly destroying her competence and stability.

Cornelius landed on her window ledge and knocked with one claw against the glass.

The light inside flickered. Shadows moved. Then the window opened and Photine looked out at him with eyes that showed no surprise whatsoever.

"I have been expecting you," she said. "Come inside, Cornelius Drake. We should discuss what I have done."
