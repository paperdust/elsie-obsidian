# Chapter 1

"Absolutely not."

Cornelius wedged the slim volume deeper into the gap between the reading table and the wall, pushing it with one taloned foot until only the faintest edge of leather binding remained visible. He stepped back and examined his work with a critical eye. Adequate. The casual observer would never notice it, and Imelda Kassiani, though thorough, was not one to crawl on her stomach searching for contraband.

Behind him, the library hummed with its usual rhythms. Pages turned. Chairs scraped against tiles. Someone coughed near the history section. Normal sounds. Safe sounds. The sounds of order.

Cornelius flicked his tail and moved to the next table.

He had been at this since the morning bell, systematically relocating his most precious acquisitions to places Imelda would not think to inspect. The slim volume—a treatise on early coastal navigation, magnificently illustrated—now resided in temporary asylum. The illuminated songbook had been slipped between two massive legal codices on the top shelf, a location Imelda avoided due to her increasing difficulty with ladders. The first edition medical text, leather cracked with age and use, currently occupied the space beneath a loose floor tile near the mint patch in the courtyard.

He was not hoarding. He was *preserving*. There existed a categorical difference, and the fact that Imelda refused to acknowledge this difference did not make him incorrect.

The library door opened. Cornelius froze, one claw extended toward a treatise on metallurgy.

Imelda's voice carried across the reading room. "Good. You are still here."

Cornelius retracted his claw and turned, arranging his wings in a posture of casual indifference. "I am always here. It is my library."

"It is *the* library." Imelda crossed the floor, her sandals whispering against the tiles. Silver-white braids swung with each step, copper beads clicking softly. She carried a writing board and wore the expression Cornelius had come to recognize as her "we are about to have a conversation you will not enjoy" face. "And I trust you have been making progress on the donation list."

"I have given the matter considerable thought."

"Thought is not the same as action."

"Thought precedes action. One cannot act wisely without first engaging in rigorous intellectual—"

"How many books have you selected?"

Cornelius adjusted his spectacles. "The process is complex. Each volume must be evaluated for historical significance, structural integrity, likelihood of public interest—"

"How many, Cornelius?"

He flexed his claws against the tile. "Three."

"Three."

"Yes. Three carefully chosen volumes that will serve the community adequately while preserving the integrity of the collection."

Imelda set down her writing board and fixed him with the sort of look that made younger librarians confess to misfiling before she even asked a question. "We agreed on fifty books for the charity sale."

"You agreed. I registered my objections."

"Your objections were noted and dismissed."

"Then the process was hardly an agreement."

Imelda sighed, a long exhalation that spoke of decades spent managing both books and the dragons who loved them. She pulled out a chair and sat, knitting her ink-stained fingers together. "The Temple is in need. The winter—" She paused. "The season has been difficult. Demos is treating more patients than he can manage, and their supplies are stretched beyond capacity."

"I am aware." Cornelius had seen the lines outside the Temple. Longer each week. "However, books are not bandages. Selling our collection will not set broken bones or cure fever."

"The money from the sale will purchase what they need."

"For a month. Perhaps two. Then what? We will have depleted our collection for a temporary relief." He began pacing, claws clicking against tile. "These books are irreplaceable. When they are gone, they are *gone*. Knowledge lost. History scattered. I cannot—" He stopped himself, tail lashing once. "I will not participate in the destruction of what I have spent decades protecting."

"No one is asking you to destroy anything. We are asking you to share."

"Sharing implies temporary lending. This is permanent severance."

Imelda stood, smoothing her robes. "I need the list by sunset. Fifty books, Cornelius. If I do not have your selections, I will make them myself."

The threat landed like a stone in water. Cornelius drew himself up to his full height—which, admittedly, only brought his head level with Imelda's knee—and spread his wings. "You would not dare."

"I have the authority and the ladder. Do not test me."

They regarded each other across the reading table. Somewhere in the back stacks, someone dropped a scroll. The papyrus rattled against the floor.

Cornelius folded his wings. "I will provide a list."

"Fifty books."

"A list of considerable length."

"With fifty titles on it."

"I make no promises regarding the quality of those titles."

"I will review your selections personally." Imelda collected her writing board. "If I find you have listed fifty copies of *The Comprehensive Guide to Bathhouse Maintenance*, we will have another conversation."

She left him alone with the books and his thoughts.

Cornelius waited until her footsteps faded before slumping against the table leg. Fifty books. Fifty irreplaceable volumes cast into the chaos of public ownership, where they would be handled with unwashed hands, read without proper respect, shelved incorrectly, or worse—loaned out and never returned.

He looked at the metallurgy treatise. Perhaps if he shelved it with the agricultural texts, Imelda would overlook it.

He was still contemplating hiding strategies when the noise from the square drifted through the library's open windows.

Raised voices. Not the cheerful argument of merchants haggling, but something sharper. Angrier.

Cornelius abandoned the treatise and moved to the window.

The town square spread below the library's elevated position, a mosaic of people and market stalls arranged around the central fountain. The fountain itself—a gift from the Kallistos tile family, depicting dolphins in blue and silver ceramic—usually provided a soothing background murmur. Today the water sounds were drowned by shouting.

A crowd had gathered near the fountain steps. Cornelius could see the distinctive grey robes of Temple healers. Two of them. One was Brother Demos, his half-elf height making him visible above the surrounding humans. The other was Sister Photine, standing slightly apart.

Facing them was a Gorgon woman Cornelius recognized as Xanthe. She held herself with the coiled tension of someone ready to strike or flee.

The crowd gave her space. Of course they did.

Cornelius debated returning to his book-hiding. Public disagreements were common enough, and rarely his concern. His responsibility lay with the written word, not the spoken argument.

But something about the scene pulled at his attention. Perhaps it was the way the crowd had formed—not a casual gathering of curious onlookers, but a wall of witnesses, blocking the paths away from the fountain. Perhaps it was the rigid set of Demos's shoulders, or the way Photine had wrapped her arms around herself despite the warmth.

Or perhaps it was simply that he needed a distraction from Imelda's impossible demands.

Cornelius spread his wings and launched himself from the window ledge.

The glide down to the square was brief but satisfying. Air rushed past his scales, warm and carrying the scents of baked bread from Cassius's shop, olive oil from the market stalls, and the ever-present salt tang from the harbor. He landed on the fountain's rim, tucked his wings, and positioned himself where he could observe without being obvious.

Not that dragons were ever truly inconspicuous, but one learned to minimize one's profile.

"—don't care about protocol!" Xanthe's voice cut across the square. "She is *dying*. You helped Markos's daughter last month. You set Yiayia Despina's grandson's leg the week before. But my cousin is not worth your time?"

Demos spread his hands in a gesture that managed to be both apologetic and immovable. "I explained this. The leg was a compound fracture. Immediate intervention prevented permanent damage. Your cousin has a fever—"

"Had. She *had* a fever. It has been three days. Now she cannot stand without help."

"I understand your concern—"

"You understand *nothing*." Xanthe took a step forward. The crowd shifted, murmurs rippling through the assembled witnesses. "You sit in your Temple with your rules and your lists, deciding who suffers and who gets relief. You are not healers. You are gatekeepers."

"We are both." Demos's voice remained level, but Cornelius could see the tension in his jaw. "Our resources are not infinite. If I treat every fever, I will have nothing left for the injuries and illnesses that will kill within hours. Triage is not cruelty. It is mathematics."

"It is murder by another name."

"It is survival."

Someone in the crowd made a warding gesture. Cornelius recognized the motion—a remnant of older, less enlightened times when people believed Gorgon anger could petrify without intent. Superstitious nonsense, of course. Petrification required direct eye contact, sustained focus, and deliberate magical channeling. One could not accidentally turn someone to stone any more than one could accidentally conjugate a verb.

But superstition was not susceptible to logic.

Xanthe saw the gesture too. Her hands curled into fists. "You see? This is what we are to you. Monsters to be managed. Threats to be contained. Never mind that we pay the same taxes, follow the same laws, breathe the same air. When we need help, there is always a reason we must wait."

"The Temple serves everyone according to need—"

"The Temple serves everyone according to *convenience*." Xanthe's voice dropped, going quiet and sharp. "My cousin has done nothing wrong. She works at the washhouse. She tends her garden. She harms no one. But she is Gorgon, and so her fever is not urgent. Her pain is not priority. Her *life* is not worth disrupting your precious schedule."

Demos closed his eyes briefly. When he opened them, Cornelius saw something that surprised him: genuine sorrow. "If I could heal everyone, I would. But I cannot. The supplies we have, the time we have, the energy we have—it is all limited. If your cousin's condition worsens, bring her to the Temple. We will assess—"

"Assessment is not treatment."

"It is what I can offer."

Xanthe stared at him. The square had gone quiet enough that Cornelius could hear the fountain water splashing against ceramic. 

"Then your offer is worthless," Xanthe said.

She turned and walked away. The crowd parted for her instantly, bodies shifting to create a clear path. No one touched her. No one spoke.

Cornelius watched her go, then turned his attention to Demos.

The half-elf stood very still, hands hanging at his sides. His expression was carefully neutral, but Cornelius could see the cost of maintaining it in the tightness around his eyes, the deliberate control of his breathing.

This was not a man enjoying his authority. This was a man being crushed by it.

Sister Photine moved to Demos's side and touched his shoulder. They exchanged words too quiet for Cornelius to hear, then began walking back toward the Temple.

That was when Cornelius got a clear look at Photine.

He had seen her before, of course. The library and the Temple shared resources and space, and Photine occasionally consulted the medical texts in the collection. She was perhaps fifty years old, competent, professional, and generally too busy to engage in prolonged conversation—which Cornelius appreciated.

But the woman walking away from the fountain looked a decade older than the healer he remembered.

Her grey robes hung loose on a frame that had lost flesh. Dark circles shadowed her eyes. Her hands, normally steady enough to suture wounds and mix precise doses, trembled as she gripped Demos's arm.

And her expression, in the moment before she turned away, was not tired or frustrated or sad.

It was terrified.

The crowd began to disperse, breaking into smaller clusters of conversation. Cornelius caught fragments as people passed the fountain.

"—should have helped her—"

"—can't just give medicine to everyone who asks—"

"—Gorgons always think they deserve special treatment—"

"—my sister waited two weeks for her elbow—"

"—not about deserving, it is about *affording*—"

That brought Cornelius up short. He turned toward the speakers, two human women with the callused hands of washerwomen.

"Xanthe has money," the first said. "She does leatherwork. Good leather, too. I bought a belt from her last spring."

"Money does not matter if there is no supply to buy." The second woman shifted her basket to her other hip. "My cousin works at the Temple. She says they have been running out of everything. Fever root. Boneset. Even basic bandage cloth. Demos has been rationing since—" She paused. "Well, for a while now."

"That cannot be right. The Temple families fund them."

"Funded. Past tense." The woman lowered her voice. "There is talk that the donations have dried up. The Kallistos family had a bad tile season. The Doukas family is focused on the harbor expansion. The Veneti family is—well, you know about their internal troubles. Meanwhile, everyone needs more healing than usual, and there is less to give."

They moved on, leaving Cornelius alone with this new information.

The Temple was running out of supplies.

Which meant Demos's refusal was not political or prejudiced. It was practical. He genuinely did not have enough medicine to treat every case. He was performing triage because the alternative was running out entirely and helping no one.

And Imelda wanted Cornelius to donate fifty books to raise money for this failing system.

Temporary relief, he had called it. But perhaps temporary relief was all anyone could manage. Perhaps the choice was not between permanent solutions and futile gestures, but between futile gestures and no gestures at all.

Cornelius looked back toward the library, thinking of the slim volume wedged behind the reading table. A treatise on coastal navigation. Beautiful illustrations. Irreplaceable historical document.

Also: completely useless for healing fever.

He thought of the three books he had selected for the donation list. All worthy volumes. All texts he would not miss terribly. All safe choices that cost him nothing.

Fifty books. Imelda had demanded fifty.

Cornelius spread his wings and launched himself back toward the library window, but his trajectory felt heavier than usual, weighted by something more than bronze scales and academic robes.

The reading room was empty when he landed. He walked to the table where he had hidden the navigation treatise and stared at the gap.

He could leave it there. Imelda would never find it. The book would remain safe in his collection, preserved for future scholars who would appreciate its value.

Or he could add it to the list.

One book would raise perhaps five silver marks at the charity sale. Enough to purchase basic bandage cloth, or a small amount of fever root. Not enough to save Xanthe's cousin, probably. Not enough to solve the Temple's fundamental resource problem.

But enough to help someone. Perhaps several someones.

Cornelius pulled the treatise from its hiding place and set it on the table. The leather binding was warm from its confinement. He opened to the first page, where the cartographer's elegant script described the proper method for determining latitude by star position.

Valuable. Beautiful. Irreplaceable.

And currently worth less than bandages.

He closed the book and moved to retrieve the illuminated songbook from between the legal codices.

By the time Imelda returned to check on his progress, Cornelius had assembled a stack of twenty-three volumes on the central reading table. Not fifty. He could not bring himself to fifty. But twenty-three was more than three, and several of them were pieces he had planned to keep indefinitely.

Imelda looked at the stack, then at Cornelius.

"It is a start," she said.

Cornelius said nothing. He was watching the library entrance, where a window faced the square.

Somewhere out there, Xanthe was caring for a dying cousin with whatever resources she could scrape together. Demos was returning to a Temple that demanded he perform miracles with dwindling supplies. And Photine—

Photine was terrified.

Cornelius did not know why, precisely. But he knew the look of someone carrying a weight too heavy to bear, and he knew the expression of someone running out of time.

"I will add more to the list," he said quietly. "But I need time to select them properly."

"You have until sunset."

"That is not sufficient—"

"Sunset, Cornelius." But Imelda's voice was gentler now. She reached out and straightened the top book on his stack. "I know this is difficult. But it is necessary."

"Necessity is a tyrant that demands we sacrifice our principles."

"Sometimes. And sometimes it demands we live up to them." She patted his head, a gesture he normally would have protested, and left him alone with his inadequate stack of offerings.

Cornelius spent the remainder of the afternoon pulling books from shelves and trying to calculate their worth in units of human suffering prevented. It was an impossible equation. How did one measure the value of knowledge against the value of medicine? How did one weigh history against health?

By sunset, he had forty-seven volumes assembled. Three short of Imelda's demand, but significantly more than he had thought himself capable of surrendering.

He delivered the list to her office and left before she could comment on the deficit.

The library closed as the light faded. Cornelius performed his usual evening routine: checking that all candles were properly extinguished, ensuring windows were latched, verifying that no books had been misshelved by patrons who thought they understood proper cataloging but demonstrably did not.

Everything was in order.

Everything except the hollow feeling in his chest where his certainty used to rest.

He climbed to his usual roosting spot in the library's small dome, where the curved ceiling collected warmth and the height provided a view of the town below. The square was dark now, the fountain a shadow against deeper shadows. The Temple windows glowed with lamplight—Demos and Photine working late, no doubt, trying to stretch insufficient resources across infinite need.

Cornelius settled onto his perch and tucked his wings. Tomorrow he would begin the process of properly cataloging his reduced collection. Tomorrow he would adapt to the new shape of his hoard.

Tonight, he simply sat in the dark and wondered if knowledge truly mattered when people were dying for lack of bandages.

The question did not have a satisfying answer.

He was still thinking about it when sleep finally claimed him, pulling him down into dreams where books transformed into medicine bottles, and every page he turned revealed another empty shelf.
