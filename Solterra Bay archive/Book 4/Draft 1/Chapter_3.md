# Chapter 3

"You were seen near the Temple the night before last."

Cornelius settled onto the stone bench at the back of the Town Hall's interrogation loggia and arranged his tail to avoid the gap between tiles. Captain Theo stood at the center of the space, arms crossed, while Kyra Kallistos perched on the witness chair like a bird prepared for flight. Two Watch guards flanked the entrance—standard procedure, though Cornelius suspected their primary function was theatrical rather than practical.

Kyra smoothed her silk chiton with hands that trembled slightly. "I visit the Temple frequently. I make donations. It is hardly unusual."

"At sunset?"

"The Temple does not close at sunset."

"No. But most visitors conduct their business during daylight hours." Theo consulted his notes. "You were observed entering through the south gate just as the evening bell rang. You remained inside for approximately one hour. What was the nature of your visit?"

Kyra's gaze flicked toward the guards, then back to Theo. "Personal business."

"Personal business with whom?"

"I do not see how that is relevant to—"

"A healer has been petrified, Citizen Kallistos. Everything is relevant until I determine otherwise."

Cornelius watched Kyra's posture shift. Her spine straightened. Her chin lifted. The trembling hands stilled as she folded them in her lap with deliberate precision. It was the physical translation of someone building walls.

"I consulted with Sister Photine regarding a private medical matter," Kyra said, each word placed carefully. "The consultation concluded. I left through the south gate. I encountered no one in the Archives because I had no reason to enter the Archives."

"What medical matter?"

"As I said, it was private."

"Privacy is a luxury during murder investigations."

"Brother Demos is not dead." Kyra's voice sharpened. "That was made quite clear during your summons this morning. Petrified, yes. Reversible within seventy-two hours. Those were your exact words."

Theo's jaw tightened. "Assault, then. The point stands."

"Does it? Because it seems you are questioning me based solely on my species rather than any actual evidence of wrongdoing."

"I am questioning you because you were present at the Temple during the window when the petrification occurred."

"So was every patient who sought treatment that evening. So was every healer on duty. So was anyone who walked past the Temple on their way home." Kyra gestured toward the square beyond the loggia. "Half the town moves through the Temple district at sunset. Are you interrogating all of them?"

Cornelius made a note in his ledger. Kyra's evasion regarding the medical consultation was notable, but her logic regarding Theo's methodology was sound. Presence at the Temple did not equate to presence in the Archives, and Theo had yet to establish a procedural path between the two locations.

Theo leaned against the table, deliberately casual. "How well do you know Xanthe?"

The question produced a visible flinch. Kyra recovered quickly, but Cornelius noted the reaction. Fear? Embarrassment? Something else entirely?

"We are acquainted," Kyra said. "The community is not large. Everyone knows everyone."

"But you are cousins. Family."

"Distant cousins. We do not socialize regularly."

"No? I was told you attended the Gorgon Enclave gathering last month. That seems social."

Kyra's hands clenched briefly before smoothing flat again. "Attendance at community events is expected. It does not indicate personal closeness."

"Strange. Because when I mentioned Xanthe's name, you looked like I had struck you."

"I did not—" Kyra stopped, visibly recalibrating. "Captain, I came here voluntarily when summoned. I have answered your questions. But I will not sit here while you fabricate reactions to support whatever theory you have already decided upon."

She stood. Theo straightened but did not move to block her path.

"If you intend to arrest me," Kyra said, "do so. Otherwise, I have business to attend to."

"I may have additional questions."

"Then you know where to find me." Kyra swept past the guards, her silk chiton whispering against stone. She did not look at Cornelius as she departed, though he suspected she was aware of his presence. Gorgons possessed exceptional peripheral vision—a biological adaptation to avoid accidental petrification of allies.

The loggia settled into silence. Theo made several additions to his notes, the pencil scratching sharp against paper.

Cornelius cleared his throat. "She is hiding something."

"Obviously." Theo did not look up from his writing. "The question is whether she is hiding involvement in the assault or simply protecting her reputation."

"Reputation regarding what?"

"The Kallistos family is—" Theo paused, selecting words carefully. "—particular about public perception. They have built their social position through careful curation of image. A Gorgon family member consulting the Temple healers for certain types of medical assistance would be considered embarrassing."

"What types of medical assistance would be embarrassing?"

Theo finally looked at him. "The type that involves passing."

Cornelius required three seconds to process the implication. Passing. The practice of Gorgons using medical intervention to appear more human—magical suppression of natural traits, cosmetic alterations, behavioral coaching. It was legal but controversial, viewed by some Gorgons as necessary survival and by others as cultural betrayal.

"Ah," Cornelius said.

"Yes. Ah." Theo returned to his notes. "Which means Kyra likely has a legitimate reason for evasion unrelated to petrification. But I cannot eliminate her as a suspect based on embarrassment alone."

"Agreed. Though I would note that her reaction to Xanthe's name suggests tension between them. If that tension relates to differing views on passing versus cultural authenticity, it might create additional complications in the community."

"Already noted." Theo tapped his pencil against the table. "Xanthe is next. Given her public confrontation with Demos yesterday, she moves to the top of the suspect list."

Cornelius shifted his weight, tail curling around his feet. "Suspicion based on public argument is circumstantial."

"Suspicion based on motive, opportunity, and demonstrated hostility toward the victim is investigative prudence."

"Demonstrated hostility toward Temple triage policy. Not toward Demos personally."

"She accused him of murder."

"She accused the *system* of murder by neglect. There is a categorical difference."

Theo set down his pencil with deliberate care. "Drake, I appreciate your analytical perspective. Truly. But you need to understand something about practical law enforcement. When someone publicly threatens a victim and that victim is subsequently attacked, the public threat becomes relevant regardless of philosophical nuance."

"Xanthe did not threaten Demos. She argued with him."

"She called him a gatekeeper denying her dying cousin medical care."

"Which, I note, was factually accurate given the Temple's supply constraints."

"That does not give her the right to petrify him in retaliation."

"No one has established that she *did* petrify him. You are constructing causality from temporal proximity and emotional intensity, neither of which constitute proof."

The guards at the entrance exchanged glances. Cornelius ignored them. Theo rubbed his temples as though developing a headache.

"Are you finished?" Theo asked.

"That depends on whether you intend to conduct an actual investigation or simply confirm your existing assumptions through selective interrogation."

"I am investigating. I am doing so by questioning the individual with the clearest motive."

"Motive is insufficient without means and opportunity. Has Xanthe demonstrated ability to petrify?"

"She is Gorgon. All Gorgons possess the biological capacity."

"All humans possess the biological capacity to strangle someone with their hands. That does not make every human a murder suspect when strangulation occurs."

Theo's expression shifted into something harder. "The comparison is not equivalent. Gorgon petrification is a documented magical ability used both defensively and offensively throughout recorded history. It is reasonable to investigate Gorgons first when petrification occurs, just as it would be reasonable to investigate mages first if someone were killed by magical fire."

Cornelius flexed his claws against the stone bench. The logic was sound in abstract. The application, however, carried the weight of historical prejudice that transformed reasonable investigation into targeted harassment.

Before he could formulate a response, footsteps echoed from the square. Xanthe appeared at the loggia entrance, flanked by two different guards. She walked with the controlled deliberation of someone refusing to be escorted, though the guards maintained close proximity.

"You summoned me, Captain." Xanthe's voice carried the flat quality of suppressed anger. "I am here."

Theo gestured toward the witness chair. "Please, sit."

"I prefer to stand."

"It was not a request."

Xanthe remained standing for three additional seconds—enough to establish that her eventual compliance was choice rather than obedience—before settling onto the chair. She did not arrange her posture for comfort or presentation. She simply sat, arms crossed, meeting Theo's gaze with unwavering directness.

Cornelius noted the purple shadows beneath her eyes, the tension in her shoulders, the ink stains on her fingers. A leatherworker's hands, marked by dye and tool work. She wore practical clothing—leather vest over linen tunic, trousers rather than chiton—and carried herself with the braced posture of someone expecting attack.

"You had a public altercation with Brother Demos in the square yesterday," Theo began.

"I had a conversation about medical neglect. If you consider that an altercation, your threshold for conflict is remarkably low."

"You accused him of allowing your cousin to die."

"I stated facts. My cousin is ill. The Temple refuses treatment. These are observable realities, not accusations."

"The Temple explained their triage protocols—"

"The Temple explained their priorities. Which apparently place Gorgon lives below human convenience."

Theo's pencil stilled against his notes. "That is a serious accusation."

"It is a documented pattern. Markos's daughter received immediate care for a broken leg. Yiayia Despina's grandson received immediate care for a dislocated shoulder. My cousin, suffering from an escalating fever, was told to wait for assessment." Xanthe leaned forward slightly. "The difference is not medical urgency. The difference is species."

"Or the difference is available resources and the severity of immediate complications."

"How convenient that the available resources are never sufficient when Gorgons require them."

Cornelius made a note. Xanthe's argument mirrored her statements from the square with remarkable consistency. Either she was repeating a genuinely held belief, or she was maintaining a prepared narrative. Both possibilities remained plausible.

Theo set down his pencil. "Where were you the night before last, between sunset and midnight?"

"At home. Working."

"Can anyone confirm that?"

"My cousin. Though given her fever, I suspect you would dismiss her testimony as unreliable."

"Anyone else?"

"No. I work alone."

"How convenient."

Xanthe's hands curled into fists. "Convenient would be having an alibi that satisfies your predetermined conclusion. Unfortunately, I spent the evening creating leather goods and caring for my ill cousin rather than arranging witnesses to my innocence."

"Did you visit the Temple that evening?"

"No."

"The south gate guard logged a Gorgon visitor entering at sunset."

"Then it was not me. There are other Gorgons in this city, Captain. We do not share a collective consciousness."

"But you do share collective grievances against the Temple."

"We share justified frustration with systemic discrimination. That is not the same as collective guilt."

Theo leaned against the table, mirroring the casual posture he had used with Kyra. "You argued publicly with Demos. You accused him of cruelty. You have documented history of advocating for—" he consulted his notes "—'aggressive community action' during Enclave meetings. And now Demos is petrified. You understand why that sequence looks suspicious."

"I understand that you want a convenient suspect to satisfy public anxiety. I am not required to help you construct a case against myself."

"Cooperation would suggest innocence."

"Cooperation would suggest I trust your interest in truth over expediency. I do not."

The loggia went quiet. Somewhere in the square, a merchant called out prices for olive oil. A cart rattled past on stone wheels. Normal sounds, continuing despite the abnormal conversation.

Cornelius stood, his claws clicking against the bench. Both Theo and Xanthe turned toward him.

"I have a question," Cornelius said.

Theo gestured permission. Xanthe simply waited.

"Petrification," Cornelius continued, "requires sustained eye contact and focused magical channeling. It is not—despite popular mythology—an instantaneous or reflexive process. The transformation takes between fifteen and forty-five seconds, depending on the caster's skill and the target's resistance."

"Your point?" Theo asked.

"Brother Demos was petrified while reaching for a ledger in the Archives. His position indicates he was engaged in routine filing when the transformation occurred. There is no evidence of struggle, no displaced books, no disturbance in the dust beyond normal movement." Cornelius adjusted his spectacles. "That suggests the petrification happened without resistance. Which means either Demos did not perceive the attack until it was too late, or he did not recognize his attacker as a threat."

Xanthe's expression shifted slightly—curiosity breaking through anger.

Theo frowned. "He could have been surprised."

"Surprise requires sudden appearance. The Archives have one entrance. That entrance is visible from every position within the room. If a stranger entered, Demos would have seen them approach. If he saw them approach and continued filing rather than reacting, he must have known them and considered them safe."

"Or he was attacked from behind."

"Petrification requires eye contact. Attacking from behind is biologically non-functional."

Theo's frown deepened. "Then the attacker approached openly, and Demos made eye contact during normal conversation."

"Precisely. Which means the attacker had legitimate reason to be in the Archives, and Demos had no reason to suspect hostile intent." Cornelius began pacing, his tail creating a soft rhythm against stone. "Furthermore, the petrification was complete and even. There are no partial transformations, no inconsistencies in the stone composition. That indicates skilled, controlled application of magic. Not a panicked reflex. Not an emotional outburst. Surgical precision."

Xanthe unfolded her arms slowly. "You are saying this could not have been a crime of passion."

"I am saying the evidence suggests premeditation and discipline. The attacker knew how to petrify efficiently and did so without hesitation or error."

Theo crossed his arms, mirroring Xanthe's earlier posture. "That does not eliminate Xanthe as a suspect. It simply suggests she planned the attack rather than acting impulsively."

"It eliminates the theory that she attacked Demos in a fit of rage following their argument. Rage does not produce surgical precision. Rage produces excessive force, collateral damage, and visible emotional residue." Cornelius stopped pacing and faced Theo directly. "If Xanthe had petrified Demos in anger, the scene would reflect that anger. It does not."

"Thank you for that assessment." Xanthe's voice carried unexpected warmth. Not gratitude exactly, but acknowledgment.

Theo ignored her. "Your 'surgical precision' theory does not change the fundamental facts. Xanthe had motive. She had opportunity, assuming she is lying about her whereabouts. And she has the means—she is Gorgon."

"So is Kyra. So is every other Gorgon in the quarter. You cannot arrest someone based solely on species capability."

"I can question them based on motive, opportunity, and means. Which is exactly what I am doing."

Cornelius felt his tail lash once. Frustration—an unproductive emotion, but increasingly difficult to suppress. "You are confirming bias through selective evidence evaluation. Xanthe appears angry, therefore she fits your theory. Never mind that the crime scene contradicts impulsive rage. Never mind that dozens of individuals had access to the Temple that evening. Never mind that the sandalwood scent suggests planning and preparation inconsistent with spontaneous attack."

"The sandalwood could belong to Xanthe."

"Does it?" Cornelius turned to Xanthe. "Do you use sandalwood oil or incense?"

Xanthe blinked. "No. I work with leather. Sandalwood would interfere with the tanning scents. I avoid floral or spiced oils."

Cornelius looked back at Theo. "There. Elimination of one suspect through basic investigative questioning."

"Or a convenient lie."

"Then verify it. Visit her workspace. Confirm the absence of sandalwood. This is not complex methodology, Captain. It is basic forensic investigation."

Theo's jaw worked. The guards at the entrance maintained careful neutrality, though Cornelius suspected they were cataloging every word for later gossip at the Watch station.

Finally, Theo exhaled. "Fine. I will verify the sandalwood claim. But Xanthe remains a primary suspect until I have definitive proof otherwise."

"I have no objection to thorough investigation. I object to predetermined conclusions masquerading as investigation."

"Noted." Theo gathered his papers. "Xanthe, you are dismissed for now. Do not leave the city."

Xanthe stood. She looked at Cornelius, her expression unreadable. "Your cousin's fever," Cornelius said before she could leave. "Has her condition changed?"

The question clearly surprised her. "She is—" Xanthe paused. "The same. Neither better nor worse."

"The Temple's resources remain constrained. But if..." Cornelius adjusted his spectacles, uncomfortable with the sentiment but compelled to voice it. "If the charity book sale provides additional funding, treatment capacity should increase. It is not a solution. But it may be temporary relief."

Xanthe studied him. "You donated books."

"Forty-seven volumes. Against my better judgment and professional principles."

"But you did it anyway."

"Yes."

Something in Xanthe's expression softened. Not forgiveness—she did not owe him that—but perhaps recognition. "Then I hope they sell well, Drake."

She left, her footsteps fading into the square.

Theo waited until she was gone before speaking. "That was unnecessary."

"It was relevant information regarding resource allocation."

"It was sympathy. Which she will interpret as weakness."

"I do not particularly care how she interprets basic courtesy." Cornelius gathered his own notes. "What matters is the investigation. Which you are conducting with accelerating bias."

"I am conducting it according to established protocols for petrification cases."

"Your protocols assume Gorgon hostility as default rather than investigating actual evidence." Cornelius moved toward the entrance. "The crime scene indicates planning, precision, and specific intent. Those characteristics narrow the suspect pool significantly. But you are ignoring them in favor of focusing on the suspect who best fits your existing assumptions."

"My assumptions are based on decades of law enforcement experience."

"Your assumptions are based on cultural prejudice codified into bureaucratic procedure." Cornelius stopped at the threshold, looking back at Theo. "Xanthe is angry. That does not make her guilty. Kyra is evasive. That does not make her guilty. Someone petrified Demos with surgical precision in a controlled environment. That makes them professional. Disciplined. And very likely someone you have not yet considered."

He left before Theo could respond, launching himself from the loggia steps into the open air above the square. The afternoon had progressed while he observed interrogations—the tiles below held accumulated warmth, creating thermal currents perfect for gliding.

Cornelius rode the currents toward the library, turning over the interrogations in his mind. Kyra hiding her passing treatments. Xanthe's justified rage at systemic discrimination. Theo's determination to find a convenient Gorgon suspect rather than the correct one.

And beneath all of it, the central question: who benefits from Demos being petrified and Gorgons being blamed?

The answer was not Xanthe, whose community would suffer from increased Watch scrutiny. Not Kyra, whose family reputation depended on maintaining social acceptance.

Someone else. Someone capable of precision. Someone with access to the Archives and knowledge of Demos's schedule.

Someone who wanted everyone looking at the Gorgons instead of looking at them.

Cornelius landed on the library windowsill and folded his wings. Through the glass, he could see Imelda shelving returns, her movements carrying the automatic efficiency of decades spent organizing chaos into order.

He needed to review the visitor logs again. Not just Gorgon visitors—all visitors. Every individual who had entered the Temple in the days before Demos's petrification.

The answer was there. Buried in names and times and routine documentation.

He simply had to find it before Theo arrested the wrong Gorgon and guaranteed that Demos remained stone forever.
