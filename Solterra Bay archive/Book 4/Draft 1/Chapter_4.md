# Chapter 4

"The coastal navigation treatise is not on the donation list."

Cornelius did not look up from the visitor log he was annotating. His claw moved steadily across the page, marking each Temple entry with methodical precision. "That is correct."

"I saw you pull it from the collection two days ago." Imelda's voice carried the particular quality of patience stretched thin. "You also removed the illuminated songbook, the Kyrian herbal, and the matched set of philosophical dialogues. None of them appear on the list you submitted."

"Those volumes are not appropriate for donation."

"They are extremely appropriate. They are valuable, desirable, and would generate significant funds for the Temple."

Cornelius finally looked up. Imelda stood beside the reference desk with her arms crossed, ink-stained fingers tapping against her sleeve. Behind her, the morning light filtering through the library's high windows created geometric patterns across the tile floor—a detail Cornelius registered and immediately dismissed as irrelevant to the current confrontation.

"The coastal navigation treatise is the only complete copy in the city," Cornelius said. "Selling it would create a permanent gap in the collection."

"The Temple needs medical supplies. That is not a gap. That is people dying."

"People die regardless of whether I donate books. Medical supplies provide temporary relief. Knowledge is permanent."

"Knowledge is useless if there is no one left alive to read it."

Cornelius's tail twitched. He returned his attention to the visitor log, searching for anything that might have been overlooked during his first three reviews. The entries were frustratingly mundane: patients seeking treatment, families visiting the ill, merchants delivering supplies. Nothing suspicious. Nothing that pointed to a skilled Gorgon with access to the Archives and a supply of sandalwood oil.

"You are attempting to distract me with investigative busyness," Imelda observed. "It will not work. I want those books."

"You have forty-seven books. That exceeds most donation expectations."

"You promised fifty."

"I provided what I could spare."

"No. You provided what you could bear to part with. There is a difference."

Footsteps on the stairs announced Zeph's arrival before his voice did. "Hey, so I checked the—whoa. Are we fighting? We sound like we're fighting."

"We are having a professional disagreement," Cornelius said.

"We are fighting," Imelda confirmed.

Zeph set a stack of returned volumes on the desk and leaned against it with the casual posture of someone settling in to observe drama. "What about?"

"Cornelius is hoarding books that should be donated to save lives."

"I am preserving irreplaceable texts that cannot be recovered once sold."

Zeph looked between them. "Okay, but like... people are more important than books, right?"

The silence that followed was profound enough that Cornelius heard the scratch of a mouse in the wall three shelves over.

"Of course people are more important," Cornelius said finally. "In abstract. But the specific calculation is more complex than simple moral arithmetic."

"No it isn't." Zeph picked up one of the returned books and examined its spine. "Someone's dying. You have stuff that could help. You give them the stuff. That's not complex."

"The inevitable heat death of our sun is also not complex when reduced to simplified terms. That does not make the underlying physics any less intricate."

"Did you just compare selling books to the sun exploding?"

"I compared reductive reasoning to—" Cornelius stopped. Arguing with Zeph was like trying to catalog smoke. "Never mind. What did you discover when you checked the records I requested?"

Zeph set down the book. "Right. So, I went through the Temple donation logs like you asked. The big families—Kallistos, Doukas, Veneti—they all used to give a lot. Like, a *lot* a lot. But starting about six months ago, everything just drops off."

"I am aware. The question is why."

"Yeah, that's the weird part. I asked around—carefully, like you said—and nobody really knows. People just say the families are 'having troubles' or 'managing internal affairs' or whatever vague rich-people excuses sound good." Zeph pulled a folded paper from his pocket and smoothed it on the desk. "But I did find something interesting. Look at the Temple expense reports for the same period."

Cornelius leaned forward, adjusting his spectacles. The paper contained Zeph's handwriting—messy but legible—arranged in two columns. Income dropping steadily. Expenses remaining constant until three months ago, then spiking dramatically.

"What caused the spike?" Imelda asked, moving to examine the figures.

"Medicine purchases." Zeph pointed to a series of entries. "They're buying way more supplies than normal, but they're still running out. Which doesn't make sense unless—" He paused, frowning. "Unless someone's stealing them. Or using them way faster than they should."

Cornelius studied the numbers. The pattern was clear: increased expenditure without corresponding increase in documented patient treatment. Either the record-keeping was catastrophically incompetent, or supplies were being diverted.

Theft was possible. But theft usually showed up as missing inventory, not purchased-and-depleted inventory.

"There is another explanation," Cornelius said slowly. "The supplies are being used exactly as purchased, but not within the official clinic framework."

Imelda's eyes narrowed. "You think someone at the Temple is running an unauthorized treatment program."

"I think someone was providing care to patients who could not afford the official fees." Cornelius tapped the expense column. "The Temple operates on a cost-recovery model. Patients pay for treatment. Those fees fund supply purchases. But if someone began treating patients without collecting fees, the supply depletion would continue while income dropped."

"That's charity," Zeph said. "That's just... being a good person."

"That is also financial mismanagement that would bankrupt an institution already facing reduced patron donations."

"Wait." Zeph straightened. "You think Demos was doing this? You think he was secretly treating people for free and that's why the Temple's broke?"

Cornelius considered. Demos handled the Archives. Demos managed filing. Demos had access to patient records and supply inventories. Demos worked late, often alone, with minimal supervision.

Demos had been exhausted during his confrontation with Xanthe. Dark circles under his eyes. The haunted look of someone carrying impossible weight.

"It fits the available evidence," Cornelius said.

"It's more than that." Zeph leaned forward, his expression shifting from casual to serious. "I heard something else. One of the clinic regulars—old Yiayia Despina, you know her—she was talking to Cassius at the bakery this morning. She said Demos used to show up at people's houses after dark. People in the Gorgon quarter mostly. He'd bring medicine and treat people who couldn't come to the Temple. He never charged them."

The library went quiet. Somewhere above them, the building settled with a soft creak of old timber.

"That is not financially sustainable," Cornelius said.

"No. But it's good." Zeph's voice carried unexpected intensity. "It's actually good. Like, genuinely trying to help people good."

Cornelius looked down at the visitor log. At the neat handwriting marking Temple entries. At the careful records of a system stretched beyond capacity.

Demos had not been a gatekeeper enforcing cruel triage. Demos had been trying to treat everyone despite impossible constraints. He had been spending Temple resources—against policy, against sustainability, against his own exhausted capacity—because people were suffering and he could not sit idle while they did.

And Cornelius had dismissed him as a bureaucrat enforcing rules.

"Oh," Cornelius said quietly.

Imelda placed a hand on his shoulder. "Yes. Oh."

Cornelius removed his spectacles and cleaned them with meticulous care, buying time to organize his thoughts. The revelation reorganized every assumption. Demos was not a villain maintaining systemic neglect. He was the person standing between that system and complete collapse. He was the temporary relief Cornelius had dismissed as insufficient.

He was exactly the kind of person Cornelius should have recognized and valued.

"I need to revise my assessment," Cornelius said finally, replacing his spectacles.

"Of the case?" Zeph asked.

"Of everything." Cornelius stood, his claws clicking against the tile as he moved toward the restricted section where he had hidden the most valuable volumes. "Demos was not enforcing triage to deny care. He was enforcing it publicly while undermining it privately. He was trying to preserve the system while also subverting it for individual mercy."

"That's basically what you do with library rules," Zeph observed. "You're super strict about everything except when you're secretly not."

"That is a completely different—" Cornelius stopped. It was not different. Not really. He enforced cataloging standards with absolute rigor while simultaneously creating private exceptions for specific patrons he deemed worthy. He locked the rare book room while covertly sharing texts with researchers who demonstrated genuine need.

He hoarded books while claiming it was about preservation when it was actually about control.

"I am not heroic," Cornelius said.

"Nobody said you were." Imelda followed him toward the restricted section. "But you could be helpful."

Cornelius reached the shelf where he had hidden the coastal navigation treatise. He pulled it down, the leather binding smooth and familiar against his claws. A beautiful volume. Irreplaceable. Worth significant coin at the charity sale.

Worth how many vials of medicine? How many bandages? How many late-night house calls to fevered children in the Gorgon quarter?

He set the book on the cart designated for donations.

"The navigation treatise," Imelda noted. "You are certain?"

"No. But certainty is a luxury I apparently cannot afford." Cornelius reached for the illuminated songbook next. The gold leaf caught the light, creating small bright reflections across the shelf. "How much will these generate?"

"Enough to keep the Temple operational for perhaps two weeks. Maybe three if supplies are managed carefully."

"Temporary relief."

"Yes."

"For permanent loss of irreplaceable texts."

"Also yes."

Cornelius added the songbook to the cart. The Kyrian herbal. The philosophical dialogues. Each addition felt like removing scales from his hide—necessary but fundamentally wrong.

Zeph appeared beside the cart, examining the growing stack. "This is good. Like, this is actually really good of you."

"It is pragmatic resource allocation in service of investigation." Cornelius pulled another volume from the hidden collection. A treatise on ancient governance structures. He had been keeping it for personal reading. "If Demos dies because I withheld funds that might have prevented his petrification, I will have failed both professionally and morally."

"You're allowed to just say you want to help people."

"I am not helping people. I am preventing a specific negative outcome that would reflect poorly on my judgment."

"Right. Sure. That's definitely what this is." Zeph's tone suggested he believed the exact opposite.

Imelda began sorting the new donations, creating subcategories by subject and estimated value. Her hands moved with practiced efficiency, decades of library work translating into automatic expertise.

"Seventy-three books," she said after several minutes. "This puts us significantly above the original target. The Temple can stretch this for a month if they prioritize carefully."

"They will not prioritize carefully. Demos will recover and immediately resume his unauthorized charity program, depleting resources faster than sustainable."

"Probably."

"Which means this sacrifice is ultimately futile."

"Probably."

"So why does it feel necessary?"

Imelda looked up from her sorting. "Because futile is not the same as worthless. Temporary relief is still relief. Demos bought people time. Now you are buying him time. The arithmetic is clear."

Cornelius's tail curled around his feet. The library felt different somehow. Lighter. As though removing the hidden books had reduced actual weight rather than simply moral burden.

"I am not Demos," he said.

"No. You are Cornelius. Which means you will approach helping people as though it is a complex cataloging problem requiring meticulous attention to detail and excessive internal grumbling." Imelda smiled. "That is acceptable. Different people contribute differently."

"I still think the permanent loss of knowledge is a tragedy."

"It is. But so is the permanent loss of people. You are simply choosing which tragedy to prevent."

Zeph cleared his throat. "So, uh, speaking of people who might need preventing from becoming tragedies—I heard another thing at the bakery this morning."

Cornelius turned. "What thing?"

"Cassius was talking to one of the Enclave messengers. Apparently Mother Ligeia has been acting weird lately. Like, weirder than normal weird. She's been keeping someone hidden in the Enclave. Someone she's protecting really carefully."

"Who?"

"Nobody knows for sure. But people are calling her 'the Flower.'" Zeph glanced between Cornelius and Imelda. "I figured that was probably relevant? Given the whole mysterious Gorgon situation?"

Cornelius's mind immediately began sorting possibilities. A protected individual in the Gorgon Enclave. Someone important enough for the blind matriarch to hide personally. Someone whose identity was valuable enough to obscure with metaphor.

"The Flower," he repeated.

"Yeah. I don't know what it means, but it definitely sounds like a mystery thing."

"It sounds like the next investigative priority." Cornelius moved back toward the reference desk, his earlier malaise replaced by the familiar comfort of having a specific problem to solve. "I need to speak with Mother Ligeia."

"Good luck with that," Zeph said. "She doesn't really do conversations. She does cryptic pronouncements and then stares at you until you leave."

"Then I will interpret cryptic pronouncements. I am a librarian. Obscure reference interpretation is literally my profession."

Imelda began loading the donated books onto a larger cart. "I will deliver these to the Temple and ensure they are properly cataloged for the sale. You focus on the investigation."

"The investigation that is rapidly expanding beyond simple petrification into community conspiracy and hidden Gorgons."

"All investigations expand. That is their nature." Imelda paused with her hand on the cart handle. "Cornelius. What you did just now—donating the hidden books—that was difficult. I recognize that."

"It was logical resource allocation."

"It was sacrifice. You are allowed to acknowledge it as such."

Cornelius adjusted his spectacles, uncomfortable with the sentiment. "Acknowledgment does not change the outcome."

"No. But it changes you." Imelda pushed the cart toward the stairs. "Which is sometimes more important."

She descended, the cart wheels creating a steady rhythm against stone steps. Zeph lingered by the desk, fidgeting with a loose thread on his sleeve.

"You really think the Flower thing is connected?" Zeph asked.

"I think everything is connected until proven otherwise. That is the fundamental assumption of competent investigation." Cornelius pulled his notebook from his satchel and began a new page. "Protected Gorgon. Hidden identity. Timing coincident with Demos's petrification and Temple financial crisis. The pattern is too precise to be coincidental."

"So we're going to the Enclave?"

"I am going to the Enclave. You are staying here to monitor library operations."

"That's just code for 'I don't want you involved in the dangerous stuff.'"

"Correct. I do not want you involved in dangerous situations you are unqualified to navigate."

Zeph's expression shifted into something stubborn. "I found out about the Flower. I've been helping with research all morning. I'm already involved."

"Involvement in research is categorically different from involvement in field investigation within a community experiencing heightened social tension and potential criminal conspiracy."

"You just don't want to admit you're worried about me."

Cornelius paused. He was worried. Zeph was sixteen, enthusiastic, and fundamentally decent—all qualities that would serve him poorly if Mother Ligeia decided to demonstrate why she commanded the Gorgon Enclave's absolute loyalty despite her blindness and advanced age.

"I am concerned about optimal resource deployment," Cornelius said.

"Right. Resources. That's me. A resource you're deploying by making me stay here and reshelve returns."

"Precisely."

Zeph sighed but did not argue further. He picked up the stack of returned books and moved toward the shelves. "Fine. But when you get back, you're telling me everything. No edited-for-safety summaries."

"Agreed."

"And if you get petrified, I'm telling Imelda you were hoarding even more books than the ones you just donated."

"I was not—" Cornelius stopped. He had been. Several volumes remained hidden behind the eastern archive shelves, too precious even in his newly enlightened state to risk donation. "That is blackmail."

"Yep. Don't get petrified."

Cornelius gathered his notebook, pencils, and a small vial of lavender oil—the latter being a library staple he optimistically hoped might serve as olfactory comparison to the sandalwood found at the crime scene. He paused at the library entrance, looking back at the reading room.

His hoard. His sanctuary. His carefully maintained system of order and preservation.

And now, slightly diminished. Books scattered to the world beyond his control, supporting people rather than simply cataloging them.

It felt wrong.

But it also felt, in ways he could not quite articulate, more correct than anything he had done in months.

"Do not burn down the library while I am gone," Cornelius said.

"No promises," Zeph called back.

Cornelius spread his wings and launched himself from the entrance toward the older quarter of the city where the Gorgon Enclave maintained their careful, separate peace.

Somewhere in those narrow streets, Mother Ligeia was protecting someone called the Flower.

And Cornelius intended to discover exactly why that protection felt like the key to everything.
