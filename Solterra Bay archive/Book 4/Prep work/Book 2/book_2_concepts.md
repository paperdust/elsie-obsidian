# Book 2 Concept Ideas: "The Petrified Page"

All concepts adhere to the "Cozy" constraint: Petrification is a reversible stasis (magical coma), not death.

## 1. The Alchemist's Glaze (The Industrial Mystery)
*   **The Victim:** A harsh art critic found frozen in the Kallistos showroom.
*   **The Scroll:** A recipe for "Living Clay" misfiled in the Cookbook section.
*   **The Hook:** He looks like a perfect statue. The killer tried to hide him as an exhibit.
*   **The Culprit:** **Master Stavros Kallistos** (Patriarch).
*   **The Motive (Pride/Greed):** The critic had discovered that Stavros's "ancient, exhausted clay pits" were actually empty, and he was secretly importing cheap clay from a rival city to maintain the family prestige. Stavros froze him to preserve the lie.

## 2. The Siren's Silence (The Environmental Mystery)
*   **The Victim:** Thessaly (The Tavern Siren).
*   **The Scroll:** "The Ballad of the Stone Coast" – ancient sheet music.
*   **The Hook:** She froze mid-note. Without her song, the sea is becoming dangerously rough for the fishing fleet.
*   **The Culprit:** **Captain Mago Hanno** (Orc).
*   **The Motive (Obsessive Love/Fear):** Thessaly was planning to leave Solterra Bay for a career in the capital opera. Mago, terrified of losing her and the "luck" she brought his fleet, used the scroll to keep her here forever. "If she is stone, she cannot leave."

## 3. The Codex of Stilling (The Internal Mystery)
*   **The Victim:** Brother Demos (The Borrower).
*   **The Scroll:** A forbidden scroll hidden inside a hollowed-out romance novel.
*   **The Hook:** He is frozen in a running pose in the Archives.
*   **The Culprit:** **Sister Photine** (Head Healer).
*   **The Motive (The Greater Good):** Demos had found proof that Photine was using "illegal" magical shortcuts to heal patients faster (draining her own life force, which is forbidden). She froze him to buy time to fix the records, intending to unfreeze him later.

## 4. The Petrified Root (The Botanical Mystery)
*   **The Victim:** Melaina, the shy Dryad acolyte.
*   **The Scroll:** A diagram of "The Eternal Oak."
*   **The Hook:** She has turned into actual *petrified wood* rather than stone.
*   **The Culprit:** **Master Eleni Doukas** (The Artist).
*   **The Motive (Artistic Perfection):** Eleni needed "Living Wood" to create her masterpiece (a frame for the temple). She didn't view Melaina as a person, but as a "perfect natural resource" that needed harvesting.

## 5. The Chef’s Garnish (The Culinary Mystery)
*   **The Victim:** Cassius the Baker (Satyr-kin).
*   **The Scroll:** A "Preservation Spell" for grain.
*   **The Hook:** The entire bakery is frozen in time—dormant dough, still fire.
*   **The Culprit:** **Elpida Nerva** (Niece).
*   **The Motive (Ambition):** Cassius refused to retire or modernize the menu. Elpida wanted to "pause" him for a month so she could run the bakery *her* way and prove she was right. She misread the duration.

## 6. The Lover’s Lock (The Romantic Mystery)
*   **The Victim:** Markos Veneti and Dimitra Kallistos.
*   **The Scroll:** A "Binding Writ."
*   **The Hook:** They are fused together, hand-in-hand.
*   **The Culprit:** **Yiayia Despina** (The Elder).
*   **The Motive (Meddling/Matchmaking):** She knew their families would separate them. She used an old folk spell to "bind them so no man could put them asunder," not realizing it would physically fuse them into a statue. She is frantically trying to feed them soup through a straw.

## 7. The Heavy Diplomat (The Political Mystery)
*   **The Victim:** A visiting Tax Collector.
*   **The Scroll:** A scroll of "Bureaucratic Weight."
*   **The Hook:** He is infinitely heavy and sinking through the floor.
*   **The Culprit:** **Mayor Tanit Barca** (Orc).
*   **The Motive (Protection):** The Tax Collector was going to audit the town's "creative" accounting regarding the tile export tariffs. Tanit "weighed him down" to keep him in town until she could cook the books.

## 8. The Gargoyle’s Perch (The Vertical Mystery)
*   **The Victim:** A thief (an outsider).
*   **The Scroll:** The "Architect's Defense."
*   **The Hook:** A new gargoyle appears on the roof.
*   **The Culprit:** **Nikolas Doukas** (The Manager).
*   **The Motive (Desperation):** The thief wasn't stealing money; he was stealing Nikolas's gambling debt ledger. Nikolas activated the building's defense to stop the evidence from leaving the roof.

## 9. The Mirror Trap (The Gorgon Mystery)
*   **The Victim:** A vain actor.
*   **The Scroll:** "The Gorgon's Reflection."
*   **The Hook:** The reflection froze first.
*   **The Culprit:** **A Rival Actor** (disguised).
*   **The Motive (Jealousy):** The victim got the lead role in the Solstice Play. The rival wanted to freeze him just long enough to miss the dress rehearsal and take the part.

## 10. The Unfinished Letter (The Post Office Mystery)
*   **The Victim:** A Centaur Courier.
*   **The Scroll:** A scroll containing "Stasis Dust."
*   **The Hook:** Frozen in mid-gallop on the main road.
*   **The Culprit:** **Harbor Master Theron**.
*   **The Motive (Cover-up):** The Centaur was carrying a letter to the Capital exposing Theron's smuggling ring. Theron threw the dust at the saddlebag to stop the mail, not realizing it would freeze the whole horse.
