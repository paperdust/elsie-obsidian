# RDL: Book 2 - "The Stilled Disciple"

**Status:** Final Draft 2.0 (Timeline Corrected)
**Core Truth:** Sister Photine petrified Demos to pause his intervention, and then petrified Melaina to buy time to ship her to the Capital. The climax is a race to unfreeze Demos before the 72-hour mark.

---

## 1. THE CRIME & THE CLOCK
*   **Victim:** Brother Demos.
*   **Event:** Frozen in Chapter 2.
*   **The Clock:** The spell becomes permanent after **3 Days (72 Hours)**.
*   **The Limit:** Cornelius interprets the "fading signature" of the spell and realizes they have until **Sunset on the Third Day** (Chapter 19) to unfreeze him.
    *   *Act 1:* Day 1 Morning.
    *   *Act 2:* Day 1 Afternoon - Day 2 Morning.
    *   *Midpoint (Twist):* Day 2 Noon. (Melaina Petrified).
    *   *Act 3:* Day 2 Afternoon - Day 3 Afternoon.
    *   *Climax:* Day 3 Sunset.

## 2. PHOTINE'S EVOLVING PLAN (NPE)
*   **Phase 1 (Ch 1-9):** *I can handle this.*
    *   She freezes Demos (panic). She thinks she can cure Melaina locally *and* unfreeze Demos before the deadline.
*   **The Breaking Point (Ch 9):**
    *   Demos's duties fall to her. The investigation eats her time. She is exhausted. She realizes she *cannot* cure Melaina herself.
*   **Phase 2 (Ch 10 - Midpoint):** *Buy more time.*
    *   She freezes Melaina. Not just to hide her, but to **pause** her disease so she can be transported.
    *   **The Goal:** Ship "The Statue" to the Great Temple in the Capital, where High Priests can cure the Weep.
*   **Phase 3 (Ch 11-18):** *Get the money.*
    *   Shipping a "heavy statue" discreetly costs a fortune.
    *   **The Clues:** Photine is seen selling her family jewelry, asking the Mayor for an "advance" on her salary, and begging the Tile Families for a "loan."

## 3. THE SUSPECT FLOWER (The Gorgon Enclave)
*The intersection of the suspect pool is the **Cistern District Enclave**. All suspects are Gorgons who embody the theme of "The Mask vs. The Gaze."*

### Suspect D: Melaina (The False Target / Midpoint Victim)
*   **Archetype:** The Invalid.
*   **Theme:** **Consumed by the Gaze.**
*   **Story Role:** Patient Zero. Photine's secret daughter. The tragedy at the center.

### Suspect B: Kyra Kallistos (The Passing Gorgon)
*   **Archetype:** The Debutante. (Replaces Dimitra).
*   **Theme:** **The False Face.**
*   **Identity:** A younger cousin of the main Kallistos line. She "passes" perfectly (no visible scales) and is being groomed for a political marriage.
*   **Relation:** Secret benefactor. She pays for Melaina's care to assuage her survivor's guilt.
*   **Grievance:** Demos threatened to "out" her status, which would ruin her engagement and disinherit her.

### Suspect C: Mother Ligeia (The Matriarch)
*   **Archetype:** The Gatekeeper. (Replaces Sthenno).
*   **Theme:** **The Shield / Isolation.**
*   **Identity:** The blind leader of the Enclave. She "sees" through vibration.
*   **Relation:** She hid Melaina when she was a baby.
*   **Grievance:** Demos filed to condemn the Enclave building. She views him as an invader breaching her fortress.

### Suspect E: Xanthe (The Radical)
*   **Archetype:** The Firebrand. (Replaces Euryale).
*   **Theme:** **The Glare / Defiance.**
*   **Identity:** A dockworker with visible scales who refuses to wear a veil.
*   **Relation:** Melaina's protector on the streets.
*   **Grievance:** Demos refused Triage care to her brother. She wanted him to feel the same helplessness.

### Suspect F: Myron (The Sculptor)
*   **Archetype:** The Artist. (Replaces Phidias).
*   **Theme:** **The Mirror / Sublimation.**
*   **Identity:** A reclusive artist who makes "hyper-realistic" statues (ironically).
*   **Relation:** He was teaching Melaina to control her magic through focus.
*   **Grievance:** Demos raided his studio and smashed his work, calling it "abomination."

## 2. THE VICTIM'S MOTIVE (The Tragedy)
Demos was **NOT** acting out of malice towards Gorgons, but out of **Protective Fear for Photine**.
*   **The Discovery:** He checked the "Mana Usage Logs" and realized Photine was draining her own *Life Force* (forbidden "Blood Magic" equivalent) to stabilize Melaina's condition.
*   **The Misunderstanding:** He doesn't know Melaina is Photine's daughter. He thinks Photine has become "obsessed" with a difficult case and is recklessly killing herself.
*   **The Intervention:** He wasn't going to the Council to hurt Melaina; he was going to **have Photine put on mandatory medical leave** "for her own good." He was trying to save his friend from herself.

## 4. THE CLIMAX (Day 3 Sunset)
*   **Ch 19:** Cornelius tracks Photine to the docks. She is loading the "Melaina Statue" onto a smuggler's boat.
*   **The Confrontation:**
    *   Cornelius: "You're not smuggling art. You're saving your daughter."
    *   Photine: "I have to get her on this boat."
    *   Cornelius: "If you leave now, **Demos dies**. The sun is setting."
*   **The Choice:** Photine has to choose: Ensure Melaina's safety (Boat) or Save Demos (return to Temple).
*   **The Solution:** Cornelius offers a deal. He will help her protect Melaina (using his status/resources) *if* she comes back right now to unfreeze Demos.
*   **The Resolution:** They rush back. They unfreeze Demos with minutes to spare. Photine is arrested/surrenders, but has Cornelius's promise that Melaina will be treated.
