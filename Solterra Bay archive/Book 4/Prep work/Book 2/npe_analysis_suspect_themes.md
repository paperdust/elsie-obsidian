# NPE Analysis: Thematic Resonance (The Mask & The Gaze)

**The Core Theme:** "The Price of Being Seen."
The tragedy of Melaina is that she cannot look at the people she loves without hurting them. She is forced to hide (Mask) to survive.
Each suspect should represent a different strategy for **Surviving the Gaze**.

## Suspect B: Dimitra (The False Face)
*   **Strategy:** **Assimilation / Passing.**
*   **Thematic Foil:** She proves that "Passing" is its own prison. She masks her scales with makeup and her eyes with charm.
*   **Contrast to Melaina:** Melaina *can't* pass (The Weep). Dimitra *chooses* to.
*   **Conflict:** She hated Demos because he threatened to **Unmask** her.

## Suspect C: Sthenno (The Shield)
*   **Strategy:** **Isolation / Walling Off.**
*   **Thematic Foil:** She represents the "Safe Space" that becomes a cage. She keeps the Enclave dark and closed. "If they can't see us, we are safe."
*   **Contrast to Melaina:** She wants Melaina to stay in the dark forever.
*   **Conflict:** Demos threatened to **Breach** the walls (condemn the building).

## Suspect E: Euryale (The Glare)
*   **Strategy:** **Defiance / Staring Back.**
*   **Thematic Foil:** She refuses to look away. She forces people to look at her. "I am a monster? Fine. Look at me."
*   **Contrast to Melaina:** Melaina is ashamed of her gaze; Euryale weaponizes it.
*   **Conflict:** Demos refused to **Acknowledge** her humanity (Triage). He looked right through her.

## Suspect F: Phidias (The Mirror)
*   **Strategy:** **Sublimation / Art.**
*   **Thematic Foil:** He turns the curse into beauty. He sculpts statues intentionally. He controls the transformation that Melaina cannot.
*   **Contrast to Melaina:** He represents "mastery." Melaina represents "chaos."
*   **Conflict:** Demos called his art "fake" or "dangerous." He insulted his **Vision**.

## Summary
*   **Dimitra lies** about what she is.
*   **Sthenno hides** what she is.
*   **Euryale flaunts** what she is.
*   **Phidias transforms** what he is.
*   **Melaina is consumed** by what she is.
