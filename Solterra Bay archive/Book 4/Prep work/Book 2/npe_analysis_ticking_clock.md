# NPE Analysis: The Ticking Clock Implications

**The Constraint:** The Petrification Spell becomes permanent (True Marble) after **72 Hours**.
**The Targets:** Demos (Ch 2) and Melaina (Ch 10).

## 1. The Asymmetric Timelines
*   **Clock A (Demos):** Frozen in Ch 2.
    *   *Deadline:* Expired by Ch 10 (Midpoint).
    *   *Implication:* Demos is **Gone**. This raises the stakes massively. Photine has already failed once. She *knows* the cost. His permanence is the weight dragging her down.
*   **Clock B (Melaina):** Frozen in Ch 10.
    *   *Deadline:* Ends at Ch 19 (The Climax).
    *   *Implication:* The entire second half of the book is a race against *this specific clock*.

## 2. Photine's Behavior (Act 3 Deviation)
Because she is on a deadline, Photine cannot be the "Cool, Calm Healer." She must become **Manic**.

*   **The Pinch (Ch 13):** She starts taking insane risks to access the Library's "Forbidden Section" to find a faster counter-spell or a way to extend the timer.
*   **The Clue:** She is seen *ignoring* other patients. The "Saint of Solterra" is suddenly letting people wait with broken legs because she is frantically reading dusty scrolls in the basement.
*   **The Error:** She tries to "borrow" Cornelius's reading glasses (magnification) or asks Zeph specific questions about "Mineral Reversal," which tips them off.

## 3. Cornelius's Pressure
Cornelius notices the **Decay** of the stone.
*   *Observation:* Demos's statue is changing texture (becoming harder, colder).
*   *Deduction:* If Melaina is the same, *she is dying*.
*   *The Choice:* He realizes that finding the killer is secondary to finding the **Counter-Spell**. He has to solve the "Whodunit" not to punish the guilty, but to unlock the knowledge to save the innocent. The "Puzzle" becomes a "Rescue Mission."

## 4. The Climax (Ch 19)
The Confrontation happens *at the deadline*.
*   Photine is trying to cast the reversal on Melaina.
*   Cornelius interrupts her.
*   **The Dilemma:** If she stops to fight him, the clock runs out. If she ignores him, he might arrest her.
*   **The Resolution:** Cornelius *helps* her cast the spell. He validates the "Rescue" (NPE: Mercy) over the "Arrest" (NPE: Justice). *Then* he deals with the crime.
