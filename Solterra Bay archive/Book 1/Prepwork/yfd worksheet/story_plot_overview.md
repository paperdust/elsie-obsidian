### plot_beats

**beat_1_hook:** Cornelius Drake enjoys the perfect silence of his library sanctuary, establishing his obsession with order and his "hoard" of books. The impending chaos of the Spring Trading Feast threatens this peace.

**beat_2_inciting_incident:** Cornelius discovers the body of Elias of Tyre in the sealed Kallistos Vault. The shelf for the "Kallistos Letters" is empty. The sanctuary has been violated.

**beat_3_call_to_adventure:** Captain Theo Melas dismisses the murder as natural causes and closes the investigation. Cornelius refuses to accept this disorder and decides to investigate "off the books."

**beat_4_first_major_clue:** Cornelius finds the "Blue Thread" on Sophia Doukas's dress and later sees the same thread on Sister Photine, linking the suspects. He also finds the "Map" on Petros.

**beat_5_midpoint_reversal:** Cornelius publicly accuses Petros Kallistos, only to be proven completely wrong by an ironclad alibi (Petros was in jail). The theory shatters, and the town turns hostile.

**beat_6_deduction_pivot:** Cornelius and Zeph regroup in the library. They realize Elias wasn't a victim but a partner. The motive shifts from "Industrial Espionage" (Glaze) to "Blackmail" (Love Letters).

**beat_7_all_is_lost_crisis:** Alone in the alley, Cornelius is physically threatened by Alexandros Doukas, who smells of "Ozone and Burnt Almond." He realizes the killer is dangerous and physically superior.

**beat_8_epiphany:** Cornelius and Zeph realize the letters were never removed from the library because the Wards would have trapped them. The MacGuffin is still in the building.

**beat_9_climax_showdown:** Cornelius sets a trap in the library. Alexandros returns. Cornelius chooses to save his books from fire rather than just catch the killer, using the environment to pin Alexandros.

**beat_10_resolution:** The "Parlor Room" reveal. Cornelius explains the crime to Theo and the suspects. Alexandros is arrested. Equilibrium is restored to the library.

### subgenre_specific_scenes

**signature_scene_1:** **The Sensory Crime Scene:** Cornelius investigates the vault not with magic sight, but with hyper-acute dragon senses (identifying Lapis dust and Burnt Almond/Kiln Accelerant), blending fantasy biology with forensic dedication.

**signature_scene_2:** **The Cozy Interrogation:** Cornelius interviews Imelda in the stacks. Instead of a gritty police room, the truth is revealed over the smell of old paper and the quiet wisdom of a senior librarian.

**signature_scene_3:** **The Parlor Room Reveal:** The classic gathering of all suspects in the Library. Cornelius lays out the "Inventory of Truth," systematically dismantling lies before exposing the killer.

**additional_subgenre_moments:**
*   **The Food Description:** Detailed, sensory descriptions of the Feast food (which Cornelius finds culturally fascinating but biologically gross).
*   **The Animal Sidekick:** Zeph acts as the "Baker Street Irregular," doing the physical legwork.
*   **The Red Herring:** The heavy focus on the "Glaze Recipe" industrial espionage angle to mask the emotional blackmail motive.
