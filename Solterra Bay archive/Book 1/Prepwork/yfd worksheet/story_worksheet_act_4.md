**act_purpose:** Execute the "Trap" to catch the killer using intellect and environment (Library) rather than brute force.

**major_act_reveals:**
*   **The Trap:** Cornelius knew Alexandros would return for the letters because they were physically trapped by the Wards.
*   **The Weapon:** Cornelius uses "Bookbinder's Wax" and "Weighted Ladders" to neutralize Alexandros's strength.
*   ** The Heroic Choice:** Cornelius chooses to save the books from fire over his own safety, proving his priorities (and heroism).
*   **The Resolution:** The letters are shelved in the History section (where they belong), and Cornelius accepts the chaotic "human" element (Zeph/Community) as part of his hoard.
