## romantasy_elements

**romantic_centrality:** [Describe why the romance is not merely subplot—how it’s deeply entangled with the central fantasy conflict, world fate, or magical stakes.]

**magical_bonds_and_fated_connections:** [List any supernatural bonds, marks, curses, shared powers, soulmate links, or magical traditions that tie the romance directly into the fantasy world’s logic.]

**romance_tropes:** [Which classic romantasy tropes are central? (e.g., enemies to lovers, fated mates, forbidden love, royal bodyguard, magical bargains, one-bed-in-an-enchanted-inn, etc.)]

**emotional_and_magical_risks:** [Describe how magic amplifies risk or intensity (e.g., loving them could kill you, prophecy entwines your fates, love triggers world-altering consequences).]

**consent_and_power_dynamics:** [Set guidance for healthy/unhealthy dynamics, magical manipulation, agency, and how power imbalance is addressed in the romance.]

**romantic_climax:** [What would a distinctly *romantasy* climax look like? (e.g., lovers’ sacrifice breaks the curse, shared magical act saves the world, the “I love you” is as world-shaking as the final battle.)]

**integration_with_quest:** [How does the romance shape, complicate, or drive the external quest or magic-driven stakes, rather than running parallel to them?]
