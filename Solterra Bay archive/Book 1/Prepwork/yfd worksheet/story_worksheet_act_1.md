**act_purpose:** Establish Cornelius's "Silence" (equilibrium), introduce the closed circle of Solterra Bay, and shatter that peace with the murder of Elias and the theft of the Kallistos Letters, forcing Cornelius to abandon his passive role and become a detective.

**major_act_reveals:**
*   Elias of Tyre was murdered in the Kallistos Vault, and the "Kallistos Letters" were stolen.
*   The Library Vault was breached using magic (Ozone smell) and mechanics (Lapis/Oil residue), implying a sophisticated thief.
*   The "Flower" of suspects is established: Sophia (The Rival), Mago (The Debtor), Petros (The False Target), Photine (The Gossip), Eudora (The Hirer).
*   The Watch (Theo Melas) has ruled the death natural/accidental and closed the vault, effectively locking Cornelius out of his own investigation.
*   Cornelius has decided to investigate "off the books" with Zeph, marking the transition from Librarian to Sleuth.

**pov_details:** Cornelius Drake, Third Person Limited, Past Tense

**setting_and_timeline:** Solterra Bay Library (Morning) and the Main Square. Day 1.

**emotional_shift:** From Smug Satisfaction (The Silence) to Unease (The Feast/The Threat).

**authorial_intent_and_subtext:** Establish Cornelius's obsession with order vs. Zeph's chaotic energy. Plant the visual clue of the "Blue Thread" on Sophia's dress (which will later match Photine's sandal repair). Show Elias's fear to establish stakes before his death.

**key_information_and_world_building_revealed:**
*   **Character:** Cornelius is a Library Dragon (Omniglot/Detail Obsessive). Zeph is "Lamassu-touched" (Bronze hair/Guardian instinct).
*   **Plot/Mystery:** Elias delivers a package for the Kallistos Vault with "Lapis Flakes" and "Oil" on it. He asks about the Wards.
*   **World-Building:** The Spring Trading Feast is chaotic. The Library is a sanctuary.

**subplot_advancement:** Intro Zeph/Cornelius dynamic: "Annoyed Master/Bratty Apprentice."

**end_of_chapter_hook:** Cornelius looks back at the library and feels a "prickle between his scales"—the premonition of the theft.

**chapter_summary_for_writer:** Cornelius enjoys the morning silence until Zeph arrives with feast chaos. A nervous courier, Elias, drops off a package for the closed Kallistos Vault, leaving traces of lapis and machine oil. Cornelius is suspicious. Later, in the square, they spot Elias arguing with Sophia Doukas about "a promise" and "a sequence."

**pov_details:** Cornelius Drake, Third Person Limited, Past Tense

**setting_and_timeline:** Solterra Bay Library (The Vault). Day 2 Morning.

**emotional_shift:** From Routine to Violation/Shock.

**authorial_intent_and_subtext:** The focus is on the *Theft* first, death second. This defines Cornelius's alien priority system. The smell of "Ozone and Burnt Almond" establishes magic/poison without saying it.

**key_information_and_world_building_revealed:**
*   **Character:** Petros is the "False Suspect" (found at scene).
*   **Plot/Mystery:** The Vault was opened (Magically/Mechanically). The Letters are GONE. Elias is dead.
*   **World-Building:** Magic leaves an "Ozone" smell. Solterra Bay libraries have "Private Vaults."

**subplot_advancement:** Zeph reacts with human horror; Cornelius reacts with draconic possessiveness. They are out of sync.

**end_of_chapter_hook:** The realization that the sanctuary is broken and the "Silence" is gone.

**chapter_summary_for_writer:** Cornelius opens the library to find the Kallistos Vault breached. The heavy seal is melted. Inside, the shelf for the Letters is empty, and Elias is dead on the floor (unmarked, smelling of burnt almond/ozone). Zeph panics. They discover Petros Kallistos hiding nearby, drunk and holding a map of the vents. Outside, Captain Mago watches the library grimly. The crime has happened.

**emotional_shift:** From Shock to Impotent Rage (at Bureaucracy).

**authorial_intent_and_subtext:** Show that Authority (Theo) works against Truth (Cornelius). Photine's specific check of the skin (for splotches) hints she knows what killed him (medicine reaction/poison), but hiding it.

**key_information_and_world_building_revealed:**
*   **Character:** Theo is a "By the Book" obstacle. Photine (Suspect E) is a Healer who might be careless.
*   **Plot/Mystery:** Photine has "Blue Thread" on her sandal (matching Sophia). The Watch rules it "Natural Causes."
*   **World-Building:** Dragons have no legal standing to investigate. The Watch controls the keys.

**subplot_advancement:** Cornelius is stripped of his agency. Zeph watches him fail.

**end_of_chapter_hook:** Theo confiscates the key and kicks Cornelius out of the vault.

**chapter_summary_for_writer:** Captain Theo Melas arrives and treats the murder as a nuisance procedural. He dismisses Cornelius's forensic observations (lapis/oil). Sister Photine arrives to certify the death, touching the body and destroying residue evidence while checking for specific skin reactions. Cornelius spots blue thread on her sandal. Theo declares it accidental death and seals the vault, locking Cornelius out.

**key_information_and_world_building_revealed:**
*   **Character:** Eudora (Suspect F) is the "Hirer" but seemingly cold. Alexandros (Killer) wears gloves in heat.
*   **Plot/Mystery:** Eudora confirms Elias was working for her (indirectly).
*   **World-Building:** The "Mourning" period hasn't even started and people are asking for their stuff.

**subplot_advancement:** Zeph brings mint (peace offering). Cornelius admits he feels useless. They bond.

**end_of_chapter_hook:** Cornelius watches Alexandros lead Eudora away and realizes the "grief" is a performance.

**chapter_summary_for_writer:** The library is quiet and sad. Cornelius sulks in the rafters. Zeph brings him fresh mint, and they share a moment of mutual vulnerability about their fear. Eudora arrives at the back door, asking for her package. When told Elias is dead, she worries about the *item*, not the man. As she leaves, Alexandros Doukas escorts her away, acting the comforting uncle but wearing heavy gloves that hide his hands.

### chapter_5

**instructions:** Write Chapter 5. The POV is strictly Cornelius Drake in Third Person Limited (Past Tense). Follow the outline's chapter summary and emotional shift precisely.

*   **Plot/Mystery:** The "Case Board" tracks all 6 suspects. Sophia is the first target.
*   **World-Building:** "Inventory of Truth" concept.

**subplot_advancement:** Zeph agrees to be the "Watson/Accomplice." The team is solidified.

**end_of_chapter_hook:** "We are going to House Doukas." The investigation begins for real.

**chapter_summary_for_writer:** Cornelius paces the darkened library while the Feast roars outside. He realizes the Law has failed. He creates a mental (and physical) web of the suspects: Sophia, Mago, Petros, Photine, Eudora. He decides that since the Watch won't find the thief, he will. He recruits Zeph as his partner and sets their first target: The woman arguing with the dead man. They prepare to leave the sanctuary.

### subplot_tracking

**subplot_development_1:** **Ch 1:** Zeph is annoying noise. Cornelius tolerates him.

**subplot_development_2:** **Ch 2:** Zeph is part of the trauma (First Corpse).

**subplot_development_3:** **Ch 4:** The Mint Scene. Zeph offers comfort; Cornelius accepts it. They transition from "Boss/Intern" to "Shared Survivors."

### act_emotional_arc

**starting_emotion:** **Smug Superiority.** Cornelius feels safe, ordered, and in control of his domain.

**ending_emotion:** **Righteous Determination.** Cornelius feels violated and ignored, fueling a drive to restore order personally.

**key_turning_points:**
1.  **The Violation (Ch 2):** Realizing the hoard is not safe.
2.  **The Dismissal (Ch 3):** Realizing the Authority (Theo) does not value the Truth/Hoard.
3.  **The Bonding (Ch 4):** Admitting fear to Zeph, grounding him in humanity.
