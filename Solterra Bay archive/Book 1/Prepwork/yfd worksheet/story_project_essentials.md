### metadata

**story_title:** Solterra Bay Mysteries: The Silence of the Capsized

**genre_and_subgenres:** Cozy Fantasy Mystery (Primary), Low Fantasy, Slice of Life.

**projected_length:** 50,000 - 60,000 words (20 Chapters).

**position_in_series:** Book 1 of *The Solterra Bay Mysteries*. Standalone mystery with ongoing character arcs.

**target_audience:** Adult (Cozy), suitable for YA crossover. Fans of *Legends & Lattes* or *The Cat Who...* mysteries.

**tone:** "Heat, Light, and Stone." Whimsical, warm, low-stress, but with high emotional/social stakes.

**humor:** Character-driven. Derived from Cornelius's fastidious nature clashing with Zeph's teenage chaos and the town's messy humanity.

**heat_spice_level:** 1 (Cozy/Clean). Romance is a background subplot (Markos/Dimitra) or a "slow burn" friendship (Cornelius/Zeph). Any intimacy is emotional or fade-to-black.

**magic_and_violence_level:** Low. Magic is domestic (healing, mending, cooling). Violence is rare and never gratuitous. The murder is "off-screen" or non-graphic. The climax involves wits and traps, not a bloodbath.

### global_narrative_settings

**pov:** Third Person Limited.

**tense:** Past Tense.

**narration_split:** 100% Cornelius Drake (The Library Dragon).

### core_concept

**story_hook:** A fastidious Library Dragon who just wants silence must team up with a chaotic human intern to solve a murder that threatens to bankrupt his town and destroy his sanctuary.

**central_conflict:** **External:** Finding the killer of Elias and the stolen Letters before the Trading Feast ends. **Internal:** Cornelius's struggle to accept that "People" (Chaos) are necessary for "Order" to survive.

**high_concept_pitch:** *Sherlock Holmes* as a cat-sized dragon, solving crimes in a *Mamma Mia* setting with magic.

**expanded_premise:**
Cornelius Drake is a Library Dragon who believes his hoard (Verify the Dewey Decimal System) is the only thing that matters. When a sailor is found dead in his vault and priceless letters go missing, the Town Watch dismisses it. Using his draconic senses and obsessive knowledge of paper, Cornelius goes rogue. He recruits Zeph, a "Lamassu-touched" teen intern, to be his legs. Together, they navigate the feuding Tile Families of Solterra Bay to prove that the truth—like a good book—keeps the world from falling into chaos.

### unique_selling_points

**usp_1:** **The Detective is a Dragon:** He solves crimes not with magic spells, but with obsessive cataloging and sensory biology (tasting ink, smelling chemical accelerants).

**usp_2:** **Cozy Stakes:** The fate of the world is fine. The stakes are "Will the Library get messy?" and "Will the Baker lose his shop?" It’s high anxiety for the characters, low anxiety for the reader.

### themes

**primary_theme:** **Order vs. Chaos:** Cornelius learns that total Order is sterile (Disorder is Life).

**secondary_theme_1:** **Found Family:** The lonely Intellectual finds connection with the chaotic Apprentice.

**secondary_theme_2:** **Restorative Justice:** The goal is not punishment, but returning the world to equilibrium.
