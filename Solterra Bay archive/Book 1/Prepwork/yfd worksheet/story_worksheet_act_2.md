**act_purpose:** Deconstruct the "Simple Theory" (Petros is the killer). Cornelius investigates the suspects, gathers clues that seem to point one way, hits a bureaucratic wall, breaks the rules to get "proof," and suffers a devastating public reversal when his theory is disproven by an ironclad alibi.

**major_act_reveals:**
*   **Sophia Doukas (Suspect B)** hides her stress with physical items (scarf) and has a tangible link to Photine (Blue Thread).
*   **Captain Mago (Suspect C)** confirms Elias was in debt and promised "Kallistos Gold" to pay it off, establishing Elias as the active thief.
*   **Petros Kallistos (Suspect D)** is **INNOCENT**. He has an ironclad alibi (in jail during the murder) and reveals Elias tricked him into writing the vault code.
*   The "Kallistos Letters" were the primary target, and Elias likely had a partner or a boss (The "Teacher"?).
*   Cornelius's arrogance leads him to publicly accuse the wrong man, turning the community against him.

### chapter_6

**instructions:** Write Chapter 6. The POV is strictly Cornelius Drake in Third Person Limited (Past Tense). Follow the outline's chapter summary and emotional shift precisely.

**tentpole_tag:** Investigation / Clue Gathering

**characters_in_this_chapter:** Cornelius Drake, Zephyr Taraki, Sophia Doukas

**pov_details:** Cornelius Drake, Third Person Limited, Past Tense

**setting_and_timeline:** The Doukas Estate. Day 3 Morning.

**emotional_shift:** From Suspicion to Certainty (False).

**authorial_intent_and_subtext:** Show Sophia's nervousness is real but possibly misdirected (she fears for her reputation/work, not jail?). Establish the **Blue Thread** link to Photine early.

**key_information_and_world_building_revealed:**
*   **Character:** Sophia uses a "P" monogrammed handkerchief (Petros? Photine?). She smells of Turpentine (Art).
*   **Plot/Mystery:** Sophia hired Elias. The blue thread mending her dress matches the thread on Photine's sandal.
*   **World-Building:** The Doukas estate is a fortress of tiles.

**subplot_advancement:** Zeph proves useful as a distraction, solidifying the partnership.

**end_of_chapter_hook:** Cornelius pockets the handkerchief, believing it links Sophia to Petros.

**chapter_summary_for_writer:** Cornelius and Zeph interview Sophia Doukas. She is haughty and dismissive, but Cornelius spots physical tell-tales of stress (neck scarf, mended hem with blue thread). He goads her into a reaction regarding Elias, and she drops a monogrammed handkerchief (smelling of Lilac/Petros and Turpentine). Cornelius steals it, convinced it proves a romantic or criminal link between Sophia and Petros.

### chapter_7

**tentpole_tag:** Deepening / The Motive

**pov_details:** Cornelius Drake, Third Person Limited, Past Tense

**setting_and_timeline:** The Docks (The Gilded Gull). Day 3 Afternoon.

**emotional_shift:** From Professional Inquiry to Physical Threat.

**authorial_intent_and_subtext:** Establish Elias as a desperate man, not just a victim. Show Mago as dangerous but potentially lawful evil (he just wants his money).

**key_information_and_world_building_revealed:**
*   **Character:** Mago is a smuggler (Fireworks).
*   **Plot/Mystery:** Elias owed a huge gambling debt. He promised "Kallistos Gold" to pay it.
*   **World-Building:** The Docks are a separate jurisdiction of sorts.

**subplot_advancement:** Mago threatens Zeph ("Accidents happen"). Cornelius steps in to protect him, showing genuine care.

**end_of_chapter_hook:** They leave the docks with a motive (Money) but a very dangerous enemy.

**chapter_summary_for_writer:** They track Captain Mago to his ship. Mago admits Elias owed him a fortune and promised to pay with "Kallistos Gold" stolen from the vault. This confirms Elias was the active thief. Zeph spots illegal fireworks in Mago's cargo. Mago threatens Zeph, and Cornelius bristles, using his status to shield his apprentice. They leave with the motive secured.

### chapter_8

**instructions:** Write Chapter 8. The POV is strictly Cornelius Drake in Third Person Limited (Past Tense). Follow the outline's chapter summary and emotional shift precisely.

**tentpole_tag:** Pinch Point #1 / The Roadblock

**characters_in_this_chapter:** Cornelius Drake, Zephyr Taraki, Captain Theo Melas

**pov_details:** Cornelius Drake, Third Person Limited, Past Tense

**setting_and_timeline:** The Library Steps. Day 3 Evening.

**emotional_shift:** From Progress to Frustration.

**authorial_intent_and_subtext:** The System fights back. Theo isn't evil, just bureaucratic. This forces Cornelius to go "Rogue."

**key_information_and_world_building_revealed:**
*   **Character:** Theo has the power to ban Cornelius.
*   **Plot/Mystery:** The "Map" found on Petros in Ch 2 is actually a ventilation maintenance schedule.
*   **World-Building:** The Library vents are accessible if you know the route.

**subplot_advancement:** Zeph suggests the illegal solution (The Break-In), shifting the moral compass of the team.

**end_of_chapter_hook:** "Tonight, we commit a felony."

**chapter_summary_for_writer:** Returning to the library to verify the "Kallistos Gold" accounts, they find the doors barred. Theo Melas serves a Cease and Desist, effectively firing Cornelius from the case until after the Feast. Cornered and desperate, Cornelius listens to Zeph, who realizes the "map" they found on Petros is a guide to the ventilation system. They decide to break into their own library.

### chapter_9

**instructions:** Write Chapter 9. The POV is strictly Cornelius Drake in Third Person Limited (Past Tense). Follow the outline's chapter summary and emotional shift precisely.

**tentpole_tag:** False Confidence / The Setup

**characters_in_this_chapter:** Cornelius Drake, Zephyr Taraki

**pov_details:** Cornelius Drake, Third Person Limited, Past Tense

**setting_and_timeline:** The Library Archives (Night). Day 3 Night.

**emotional_shift:** From Tension to Arrogance.

**authorial_intent_and_subtext:** The classic "Detective gets it wrong" moment. Cornelius interprets the evidence to fit his bias (Petros is the thief). He ignores the fact that the handwriting on the map *doesn't match* Petros because the handwriting on the Code Note *does*.

**key_information_and_world_building_revealed:**
*   **Character:** Petros has sloppy handwriting. The Map is precise (Drawn by a Tile Maker?).
*   **Plot/Mystery:** A note with the Vault Code ("4-4-9") is found in the files, written by Petros.
*   **World-Building:** The Archives are dusty and extensive.

**subplot_advancement:** Zeph is the "man in the chair" (or vent), helping Cornelius navigate.

**end_of_chapter_hook:** Cornelius declares the case "Solved." He believes Petros is the killer.

**chapter_summary_for_writer:** They break in through the vents. In the Archives, Cornelius compares the ledgers. He finds a note with the safe code written in Petros's distinct, sloppy hand. This "proves" Petros gave the code to Elias (or used it himself). Cornelius ignores the fact that the ventilation map was drawn by a steady hand (likely Sophia), assuming it's just a conspiracy. He leaves convinced Petros is the mastermind.

### chapter_10

**instructions:** Write Chapter 10. The POV is strictly Cornelius Drake in Third Person Limited (Past Tense). Follow the outline's chapter summary and emotional shift precisely.

**tentpole_tag:** Midpoint / The Reversal

**characters_in_this_chapter:** Cornelius Drake, Zephyr Taraki, Petros Kallistos, The Mob

**pov_details:** Cornelius Drake, Third Person Limited, Past Tense

**setting_and_timeline:** The Golden Amphora Tavern. Day 4 Morning.

**emotional_shift:** From Arrogant Triumph to Humiliated Defeat.

**authorial_intent_and_subtext:** The bubble pops. The reader should feel Cornelius's shame. The crowd's reaction raises the generic stakes (Social Lethality).

**key_information_and_world_building_revealed:**
*   **Character:** Petros is a sad drunk, not a criminal mastermind.
*   **Plot/Mystery:** Petros was in the WATCH JAIL all night during the murder. Ironclad Alibi.
*   **Twist:** Elias tricked Petros into writing the code note. Elias was the active agent.

**subplot_advancement:** Zeph loses faith in Cornelius's infallibility.

**end_of_chapter_hook:** The crowd turns hostile. They have to run. The investigation is back to zero.

**chapter_summary_for_writer:** Cornelius tracks Petros to a tavern and publicly accuses him, laying out the "evidence" (Code, Map, Presence). Petros laughs sadly and reveals he was in the Watch's drunk tank from sunset to sunrise—the exact window of the murder. He explains Elias tricked him into writing the code note weeks ago. Cornelius's theory disintegrates. The crowd, loyal to the Kallistos name, turns on the "foreign dragon" and his accuser. They flee in disgrace.

### subplot_tracking

**subplot_development_1:** **Ch 6:** Zeph proves his worth as a distraction/partner.

**subplot_development_2:** **Ch 7:** Cornelius proves his loyalty by protecting Zeph from Mago.

**subplot_development_3:** **Ch 10:** The partnership is tested by Cornelius's public failure.

### act_emotional_arc

**starting_emotion:** **Determined/Hunter.** Cornelius feels he is on the scent and smarter than the system.

**ending_emotion:** **Humiliated/Lost.** Cornelius realizes he is fallible, socially ostracized, and further from the truth than when he started.

**key_turning_points:**
1.  **The Handkerchief (Ch 6):** The first tangible link that builds the false theory.
2.  **The Break-In (Ch 8/9):** Crossing the moral line to get the "truth."
3.  **The Alibi (Ch 10):** The destruction of the ego.
