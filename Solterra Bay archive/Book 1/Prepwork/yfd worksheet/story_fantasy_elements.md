**mystery_magic_integration:**
Magic in Solterra Bay is not a "Solve-All" button; it is another layer of physics that leaves evidence. The central conflict (The Murder/Theft) is driven by *character* flaws (Greed, Pride), but the *execution* involves fantasy elements (melting locks, species-specific jumping ability).
*   *Rule:* The reader must know the capabilities of the species/magic before they are used to solve the crime.
*   *Application:* We establish Imelda's metal-sensing and Cornelius's scent/taste sensitivity early so they can be used as forensic tools later.

**detective_magical_kit:**
Cornelius Drake is a "Sherlock Holmes" whose superpowers are biological, not deduced.
*   **Omniglot Reading:** He can read the history of the paper/ink itself (dating the letters).
*   **Draconic Senses:** He smells "Ozone" (Magic) vs "Burnt Almond" (Chemical Accelerant).
*   **Hoard Connection:** He physically feels when his library is disordered ("The Prickle").

**magical_clues_and_forensics:**
*   **Ozone Smell:** Indicates a spell was used (or attempted).
*   **Lapis Dust:** Indicates connection to the Blue Glaze/Pottery trade (or a Golem/Construct, but here it's Pottery).
*   **Species Traits:**
    *   *Siren:* Can hold breath (cistern escape).
    *   *Satyr:* High jump (entry via high window).
    *   *Gorgon:* Stun gaze (incapacitating a victim silently).

**cozy_stakes_scaling:**
The fate of the world is **not** at risk. The "Dark Lord" is not coming.
*   **The Stakes:**
    1.  **Sanctuary:** The violation of the Library's peace.
    2.  **Reputation:** The honor of House Kallistos and House Doukas.
    3.  **Financial:** The survival of a local business family.
*   **Why it feels High:** Because to Cornelius, the Library *is* his world. To the town, the Tile Families are their economy.

**the_nature_of_justice (Equilibrium):**
In Cozy Fantasy, the goal is **Restoration**, not Retribution.
*   **The Villain:** Alexandros is not an "Evil Sorcerer"; he is a desperate businessman who made a fatal mistake.
*   **The Punishment:** He is arrested by the proper authorities (Theo) to face trial. There is no vigilante execution.
*   **The Resolution:** The stolen items are returned to their proper place. The community heals. The "Silence" returns.

**fantasy_tropes_subverted:**
*   **The Hoarding Dragon:** Cornelius hoards *public knowledge* and shares it (mostly).
*   **The Chosen One:** Zeph is "Touched" by ancestry, but he's just an intern with a broom, not a warrior with a sword.
*   **The Ancient Curse:** The "Curse" of the Kallistos family is just a messy affair from 40 years ago, de-mythologizing the past.

**atmospheric_magic:**
The setting itself feels alive and magical without overt spell-casting.
*   *The Light:* Exploring how the sun interacts with the "living stone" of the town.
*   *The Verticality:* A town built for flying creatures (Dragons/Sphinxes) vs walking creatures (Humans/Orcs).
