### main_character_1

#### basic_information

**nicknames_terms_of_endearment:** "Lizard" (Zeph, rude), "Consultant" (Theo, respectful), "My Dear" (Imelda)

**age:** 127 (Adult/Middle-aged for a dragon)

**profession_or_role:** Proprietor/Guardian of the Solterra Bay Library (The Library Dragon)

**nationality:** Draconian (Solterra Resident)

**current_residence:** The Solterra Bay Library (specifically, the rafters and the Curator's Office)

**personality_traits:** Fastidious, Haughty, Intellectually Vain, Secretly Sentimental, Obsessive-Compulsive about Order, Loyal.

**physical_description:** A large, cat-sized dragon (12-14 lbs) with scales of burnished bronze and copper. He wears custom gold-rimmed spectacles. Moves with fluid, predatory grace when silent, but often perches awkwardly on human furniture. Breath weapon is a tiny blue pencil-flame.

**notable_interests:** Bookbinding preservation, fresh mint (addiction), sorting algorithms, silence, entomology (eating crickets).

**backstory_essentials:** Cornelius established the library as his "hoard" decades ago. He views knowledge as the only treasure worth keeping and fears the chaos of the outside world. He refers to humans by their job titles rather than names to maintain distance.

#### motivation_and_wounds

**primary_motivation:** To maintain Order and preserve Knowledge (The Hoard).

**core_wound:** **Intellectual Loneliness.** He believes he is fundamentally separate from and superior to the "inefficient" species around him, which isolates him.

**central_flaw:** **Arrogance/Rigidity.** He dismisses human emotions as irrelevant, leading him to miss critical clues (like the love letters in Act 3).

**internal_conflict:** The desire for a pristine, silent sanctuary vs. the growing affection for the noisy, messy people who inhabit it (Zeph/Imelda).

**internal_goal:** To be needed/valued not just as a monster, but as a guardian.

**external_personal_goal:** To catalog the entire Solterra Bay collection perfectly.

**external_conflict_career_or_life:** The Town Watch (Theo) does not respect his jurisdiction.

**external_conflict_public_or_family:** The constant noise and mess of the town festivals threaten his sanity.

### character_story_arc

**starting_state:** Smug superiority. He is safe in his ivory tower (library), disconnected from the town.

**growth_change_process:** The murder forces him to engage with the "messy" world. He learns that facts (Order) are not enough; he needs human context (Chaos/Love) to solve the crime. He learns to rely on Zeph.

**ending_state:** Engaged Guardian. He accepts that the library is part of the community, and his "hoard" includes the people in it.

### voice_and_inner_world

**voice_description:** Precise, antiquated, slightly melodramatic. He sounds like a Victorian nervous wreck trapped in a reptile's body.

**language_style:** Formal. Uses high vocabulary ("inefficient," "catastrophic," "acceptable"). No contractions in internal monologue.

**dialogue_style:** Sharp, correcting, often ends sentences with a rhetorical question.

**emotional_depth:** High, but deeply repressed. He channels emotion into fussiness.

**internal_voice_sample:** *The bell above the door jangled with entirely unnecessary violence. I adjusted my spectacles and peered over the railing. It was the Intern again. He was carrying a pastry that was shedding flakes of phyllo onto my newly polished floor with the enthusiasm of a molting griffin. Why must humans insist on consuming matter that disintegrates upon contact? It is offensively inefficient. "Zephyr," I projected, keeping my tone perfectly level. "If a single crumb of that monstrosity touches the First Edition Compendium, I shall feel compelled to file you under 'Hazardous Waste'."*

### main_character_2

#### basic_information

**full_name:** Zephyr "Zeph" Taraki

**nicknames_terms_of_endearment:** "Boy" or "The Intern" (Cornelius), "Kid" (Mago)

**age:** 16

**profession_or_role:** Library Intern / Student

**nationality:** Solterran (Human with Lamassu ancestry)

**current_residence:** The Lower Market District (parents' house)

**personality_traits:** Sarcastic, Street-Smart, Loyal, Insecure, Brave (when pushed), Chaotic.

**physical_description:** Lanky, gangly limbs (growth spurt). Dark skin, unruly black hair that gleams with an unnatural **bronze sheen** in sunlight (Lamassu trait). Always looks slightly disheveled.

**notable_interests:** Avoiding work, local gossip, eating pastries, "Action" novels, proving himself.

**backstory_essentials:** Zeph took the internship for school credit but secretly loves the library. He is unaware of his magical heritage (Lamassu) but feels a "buzzing" instinct to protect the building.

#### motivation_and_wounds

**primary_motivation:** To be seen as competent and "part of the team" (Belonging).

**core_wound:** **Inadequacy.** He feels like just a "screw-up kid" in a town of powerful families and ancient creatures.

**central_flaw:** **Immaturity/Defensiveness.** He uses sarcasm to hide his deeper feelings.

**internal_conflict:** Wanting to be a "normal" teenager vs. the call to be a Guardian (Heritage).

**internal_goal:** To earn Cornelius's respect (though he'd never admit it).

**external_personal_goal:** Pass his internship evaluation.

**external_conflict_career_or_life:** Cornelius is an impossible boss.

**external_conflict_public_or_family:** The danger of the investigation puts him at risk (Mago/Alexandros).

### character_story_arc

**starting_state:** Reluctant, bored intern doing the bare minimum.

**growth_change_process:** He steps up when the crisis hits. He provides the courage Cornelius lacks. He realizes he is good at this (Guardian Instinct).

**ending_state:** Confident Partner. He accepts his role as the "Legs" of the agency.

### voice_and_inner_world

**voice_description:** Modern, youthful, fast-paced. A stark contrast to Cornelius.

**language_style:** Casual, slang-heavy ("Whatever," "Gross," "Cool"). Frequent internal questions.

**dialogue_style:** Banter-heavy, defensive, often mutters under his breath.

**emotional_depth:** Wears his heart on his sleeve but tries to cover it with shrugs.

**internal_voice_sample:** *Okay, seriously? The lizard wants me to climb into the vent. The dark, dusty, definitely-full-of-spiders vent. He's sitting there polishing his glasses like asking me to potentially die of asphyxiation is a normal Tuesday. "It is the only logical route," he says. Yeah, logical for the guy with wings. I hate this job. I really, really hate this job. ...But if I don't go, he's gonna try it himself and probably get stuck, and then I'll have to explain to Imelda why our boss is a permanent fixture in the HVAC system. Ugh. "Fine. But I'm asking for hazard pay."*
