## act_3

**act_purpose:** Rebuild from the failure of Act 2. Connect the "Outlier" clues (Eudora, the Smell, the Map) to form a new, correct theory. Reframe the motive from "Greed" (Glaze Recipe) to "Honor/Blackmail" (Love Letters). Solidify the partnership between Cornelius and Zeph.

**major_act_reveals:**
*   **The Motive:** The stolen letters were *not* about the Glaze Formula (a lie Elias told Eudora). They were personal correspondence proving a Kallistos infidelity/lineage issue.
*   **The Killer:** **Alexandros Doukas** is confirmed as the physical threat. He smells of "Kiln Accelerant" (Burnt Almond/Ozone), linking him to the melted lock.
*   **The Crime:** It was an execution. Elias tried to double-cross Sophia/Alexandros, and Alexandros killed him in the vault.
*   **The MacGuffin:** The killers *failed* to leave with the letters because the Wards trapped the object. **The Letters are still hidden inside the Library.**

Alexandros caught him in the vault and executed him with a chemical fire charge. But because the Wards re-engaged (or blocked the exit of the tagged item?), Alexandros couldn't leave with the book without tripping the alarms *before* the Feast. He hid it. The macguffin is in the building.
