## world_building

**overview_setting_summary:** Solterra Bay is a vibrant, vertical city-state inspired by Mediterranean antiquity (Greece/Rome/Phoenicia) but populated by a cosmopolitan mix of Fantasy species. It is a world of "Heat, Light, and Stone," where salt air eats mental, the sun bleaches white walls, and community gossip travels faster than magic. The tone is "Cozy Fantasy"—stakes are emotional and social, not apocalyptic. The town is physically defined by its verticality (Upper Town for prestige, Harbor for commerce) and its primary industry: **Ceramic Tiles**.

### key_world_details

**key_world_detail_1:** **Ecological Dragons:** "Library Dragons" (*Draco bibliotheca*) like Cornelius are a distinct species that spontaneously generate when a collection of books reaches "Critical Knowledge Mass." Their size scales with the size of their library.

**key_world_detail_2:** **Diverse Demographics:** The town is 40% Human, 35% Mythological Kin (Sirens, Satyrs, Gorgons), 12% Elf, and 10% Orc (Phoenic heritage). Species traits (scales, horns, gills) are common and integrated into daily jobs (e.g., Siren fishermen, Gorgon architects).

**key_world_detail_3:** **The Three Tile Families:** Politics are dominated by the rival ceramic houses: **Kallistos** (Tradition/Old Money), **Doukas** (Art/Innovation), and **Veneti** (volume/Export). Their feuds drive the local economy and social friction.

**key_world_detail_4:** **Domestic Magic:** Magic exists but is strictly "Cozy" and utilitarian. It is used for mending pots, cooling ice-boxes, or easing pain. It cannot resurrect the dead, cure old age, or replace hard work.

**key_world_detail_5:** **The Spring Trading Feast:** The annual economic heartbeat of the town. For one week, the population doubles with foreign sailors and merchants. The "Winter Storm Wards" on the harbor are lowered, making the town vulnerable to both trade and crime.

### key_world_rules
[World Rules specific to the Cozy Fantasy Mystery Genre]

**key_world_rule_1:** **Magic is for Mending, not Ending.** There are no fireballs or "Avada Kedavra" spells. Conflict is physical or social; magic deals with the aftermath (healing/repair).

**key_world_rule_2:** **Species Abilities are consistent Clues.** A mystery solution must play fair with biology (e.g., A Siren can hold their breath to escape via a cistern; a Satyr can jump high walls; a Dragon can taste ink age).

**key_world_rule_3:** **Sanctuary is Sacred.** Certain places (The Library, The Temple, The Bathhouse) are neutral ground. Violence in these places is considered a blasphemy against the town itself.

**key_world_rule_4:** **Gossip is Currency.** In a tight-knit town, reputation is everything. Information flows through the Washhouse and the Bakery. If you want to know a secret, you don't spy; you buy a pastry.

**key_world_rule_5:** **The Sea Rules All.** Solterra Bay lives and dies by the tide. Weather and sailing schedules dictate the flow of the plot (and the escape route of the killer).

### setting

#### primary_location

**location_name:** **The Solterra Bay Library (The Hoard)**

**location_type:** Sanctuary / Civic Hub / Crime Scene

**atmosphere:** Cool, hushed, smelling of vanilla (old paper), dust, and fresh mint. A respite from the blinding sun outside.

**sensory_details:** The building is a repurposed Golden Age villa with honey-colored stone columns and a central dome. Light filters through amber glass, turning everything golden. Dust motes dance in the beams. The silence is heavy and curated. Mosaics on the floor depict the history of writing.

**key_features:**
*   **The Dome:** The main reading room.
*   **The Kallistos Vault:** A heavy iron door leading to the private archives (The Crime Scene).
*   **The Rafters:** Cornelius's private walkway and sleeping area high above the humans.
*   **The Intake Chute:** A brass tube for returning books from the street level, key to the mystery's solution.

**significance_to_story:** It is Cornelius's soul externalized. The murder happening *here* is a personal violation. The building itself is weaponized in Act 4 (waxed floors) to catch the killer.

#### additional_location_1

**location_name:** **The Oar & Anchor Tavern**

**location_type:** The Underworld / Social Hub

**location_details:** Located on the harbor wall, constantly sprayed by seafoam. Smells of anise (ouzo), grilled fish, and damp wool. It is loud, chaotic, and ruled by **Despina** (Orc landlady). This represents the "Chaos" Cornelius fears but must enter to find the truth.

#### additional_location_2

**location_name:** **The Tile Workshops (House Kallistos)**

**location_type:** Industry / Suspect Location

**location_details:** Hot, dusty, and loud. The air tastes of clay dust and kiln smoke. Massive wood-fired kilns roar all day. Rows of apprentices paint identical spiral patterns. It represents the crushing weight of "Tradition" that drives the suspects to desperation.

#### additional_location_3

**location_name:** **The Main Square (The Loggia)**

**location_type:** Public Stage

**location_details:** The blindingly bright center of town. White stone, blue shadows. Contains the Town Hall and the Fountain. During the Trading Feast, it is a riot of colorful tents, shouting merchants, and exotic smells. It is where the private mystery spills into public view.

#### additional_location_4

**location_name:** **The Washhouse**

**location_type:** Information Brokerage

**location_details:** A natural spring on the upper tier. Steam rises constantly. The sound of running water and slapping wet fabric covers the sound of whispering. This is where **Stavroula** holds court and where the "lower" classes trade the secrets of the "upper" classes. Also the secret meeting spot for the Romeo/Juliet subplot.
