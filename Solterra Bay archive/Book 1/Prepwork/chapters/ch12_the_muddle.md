# Chapter 12: The Buyer

**Summary**

Cornelius and Zeph track down **Eudora of Naxos (Suspect F)** at the Feast's high-end market. She is buying rare pigments—specifically **Lapis Lazuli**.

Cornelius confronts her. "You knew Elias was bringing the package. You asked for it before the body was cold. Why?"

Eudora crumbles (financially, not emotionally). "I didn't hire him to *steal*," she claims. "I hired him to *broker*." She admits she paid Elias a deposit for "The Kallistos Formula"—the secret glaze recipe allegedly hidden in the letters.

**The Clue:** Eudora confirms Elias was supposed to meet her *outside* the library at sunset. He never showed up. This tightens the timeline. Elias was killed *before* sunset.

**Subplot Friction:** Zeph gets distracted by the festivities/girls, annoying Cornelius who needs focus. "This is not a holiday, Zephyr!" Cornelius snaps. Zeph snaps back, "It is for everyone else! You're the only one obsessed with a dead thief!" They separate.

Cornelius is now alone.
