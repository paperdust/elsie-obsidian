# Chapter 10: The Shattered Tile

**Summary**

Cornelius and Zeph track **Petros Kallistos** to "The Golden Amphora," a tavern near the tile works. It is Act 2 Climax time.

Cornelius confronts Petros publicly. He lays out the "facts": The Map, the Debt, the Code, the Presence at the Scene. The crowd goes silent. Zeph stands ready to fight.

Petros laughs. It is a sad, broken sound.

"I didn't kill Elias," Petros says. "I was in the drunk tank at the Watch House from sunset until midnight. Captain Theo arrested me himself."

Cornelius freezes. "Impossible. You were at the library the next morning."

"They let me out at dawn," Petros says. "I went straight to the library to sleep it off in the vents. It's cool there."

**The Shattering:** If Petros was in jail *during the murder*, he couldn't have killed Elias. And if he was in jail, he couldn't have stolen the letters. The "Code Note" Cornelius found? Petros admits, "Elias tricked me into writing that down weeks ago. Said he forgot it."

**The Twist:** Elias didn't just know the code; he *solicited* it from the drunken heir. Elias was the mastermind, not the victim?

Cornelius's entire theory collapses. The crowd turns hostile (sympathetic to the heir). Zealots of Althaia (Photine's people) start shouting about "Lizard Witchcraft." Cornelius and Zeph have to flee.

**Word Count:** ~290 words.
