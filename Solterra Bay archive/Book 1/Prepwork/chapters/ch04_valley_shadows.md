# Chapter 4: Dust and Echoes

**Summary**

The library is closed. The "Silence" Cornelius cherishes has returned, but it feels hollow. Cornelius is despondent, perched on the highest rafter, refusing to come down. He feels he has failed his hoard.

Zeph, trying to fix the mood, brings Cornelius a "peace offering"—a bouquet of fresh mint he stole from the courtyard. This triggers a quiet moment of bonding (Subplot Beat). Zeph admits he's scared; he's never seen a dead body before. Cornelius descends to comfort him, admitting that *he* is scared too—not of death, but of uselessness.

The quiet is interrupted by a knock at the delivery door (not the main entrance). It is **Eudora of Naxos (Suspect F)**. She is young, wealthy, and seemingly oblivious to the tragedy. She asks if a package arrived from "a friend of hers" (Elias). When Zeph breaks the news that Elias is dead, Eudora's reaction is strange: she doesn't cry. She goes pale, checks her purse strings, and asks, "Did the Watch take *everything*?" Her concern is clearly for the item, not the man.

As she leaves, Cornelius watches from the window. She is met outside by **Alexandros Doukas (The Killer)**. Alexandros acts the part of the comforting uncle, placing a hand on her shoulder and steering her away from the Watch guards. He looks up at the library window, his expression unreadable, but Cornelius notes that he is wearing heavy gloves despite the heat.
