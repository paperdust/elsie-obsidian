# Chapter 5: The Proprietary Method

**Summary**

Night has fallen. The Feast is in full swing outside—fireworks, drums, shouting. Inside the library, Cornelius is pacing.

He reviews the facts.
1.  The Watch believes Elias died of natural causes (heat/heart).
2.  The Watch does not know about the stolen letters (because Cornelius didn't get a chance to tell them before being kicked out).
3.  The Watch ignores the chemical evidence (Lapis/Oil).
4.  Suspects are already moving (Eudora, Alexandros, Sophia).

Cornelius realizes that relying on "Human Law" (Theo) will result in the permanent loss of the Kallistos Letters. He cannot abide a hole in his collection. He turns to Zeph, who is gloomily eating a cold meat pie on the circulation desk.

"Zephyr," Cornelius says. "We are going to perform an inventory."

"Now?" Zeph asks. "It's midnight."

"An inventory of the truth," Cornelius corrects. He lays out a large sheet of butcher paper and begins to draw—not a map, but a web. He writes the names of everyone they have encountered.
- **Sophia** (The Angry Heir)
- **Elias** (The Dead Courier)
- **Petros** (The Drunk Witness)
- **Mago** (The Silent Watcher)
- **Photine** (The Careless Healer)
- **Eudora** (The Anxious Buyer)

"The Watch protects the peace," Cornelius declares, dipping a quill into ink with a flourish. "We protect the Knowledge. Someone stole a book from *us*. And I intend to get it back."

Zeph grins, the first real smile since the body was found. "So we're going rogue?"

"We are acting as independent consultants," Cornelius says, marking a heavy *X* over Elias's name. "First step: We need to talk to the person who was arguing with the dead man. Prepare your walking shoes, Zephyr. We are going to House Doukas."
