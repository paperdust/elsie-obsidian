# Chapter 7: The Debt

**Summary**

The Docks are loud, smelling of tar and brine. Cornelius hates it (salt ruins book bindings). They track **Captain Mago (Suspect C)** to his ship, the *Gilded Gull*. Mago is supervising the unloading of "Feast Supplies" (suspiciously unlabeled crates).

Mago is not intimidated by Cornelius. He is a man of few words and heavy silences. When asked about Elias, Mago spits on the dock. "Kid was a gambler. Bad at it."

Cornelius presses. "You were watching the library when the body was found. Why?"

Mago leans in. "Because I was waiting for my money."

**Clue Reveal:** Mago produces a ledger. Elias owed the *Gilded Gull* a massive sum. Mago claims Elias promised to pay it off "after the delivery" using "Kallistos Gold." This implies Elias was stealing from the vault, or being paid by someone to rob it.

**Subplot Beat:** Zeph recognizes the crates. They aren't food; they are *fireworks*. Illegal, high-grade explosives. Mago glares at Zeph. "Smart kid. Accidents happen to smart kids." Cornelius steps in, bristling, protecting his apprentice. "And accidents happen to smugglers who threaten City Library officials."

They leave with the info, but Mago is now a physical threat.

**Word Count:** ~280 words.
