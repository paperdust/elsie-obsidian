# Chapter 13: The Shadow

**Summary**

Cornelius walks back to the library through the thinning crowd. Without Zeph, the noise is overwhelming. He feels watched.

He takes a shortcut through an alley near the Baths. A figure steps out. It is **Alexandros Doukas (The Killer)**, though his face is shadowed. He is wearing the same heavy gloves.

"You should stop asking questions, Dragon," Alexandros says. His voice is calm, reasonable. "The Watch closed the case. Let it stay closed."

Cornelius tries to bluster. "I am a servant of the City."

Alexandros steps closer. He smells of... **Ozone**. Faint, but there. And **Burnt Almond**.

"Servants are replaceable," Alexandros whispers. He shoves Cornelius—dragons are heavy, but Alexandros is *strong*—into a wall of crates and vanishes.

**The Realization:** The Killer isn't just a thief. He is dangerous. And he smells like the crime scene.

**Word Count:** ~230 words.
