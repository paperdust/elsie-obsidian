# Chapter 9: The Penmanship

**Summary**

The break-in is successful (and messy). Zeph gets stuck in a duct, but they drop into the Archive Room next to the Vault. Cornelius accesses the "Kallistos Family Files" before the night watchman (Mago's cousin?) comes around.

He compares the crumpled "map/schedule" found on **Petros (Suspect D)** with the official Kallistos ledgers.

**The Clue:** The handwriting on the map is *not* Petros's. Petros writes in a sloppy, drunken scrawl. The map is drawn with precise, architectural lines—the kind used by a draftsman. Or a **Tile Maker**.

Cornelius ignores this clear contradiction because he settles on a "Collaboration Theory." He decides Petros was the muscle and someone else (Sophia?) drew the map. He finds a note tucked in the ledger: *"Code is 4-4-9. Do not forget again."* This note IS in Petros's handwriting.

This fuels the **False Confidence**. Cornelius now has:
1.  Petros at the scene.
2.  Petros's handwriting on the code.
3.  Elias's debt to Mago (who works with Petros).

He leaves the library convinced he has solved it. "It's Petros," he tells Zeph. "He stole the letters to pay Mago, and killed Elias when he got greedy."

**Word Count:** ~260 words.
