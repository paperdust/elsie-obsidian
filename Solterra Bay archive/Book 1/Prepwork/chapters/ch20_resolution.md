# Chapter 20: The Archive

**Summary**

It is one week later. The Feast is over. The silence has returned to the Library of Solterra Bay.

Cornelius is perched on his desk, chewing a fresh mint leaf. The air smells of dust, paper, and peace.

Zeph is shelving the "Kallistos Letters"—which Theo returned after the trial (sealed, of course). They belong in the History section now.

"So," Zeph says, leaning on his broom. "Mago sent a crate of dates. As a 'Thank You' for clearing his name."

"Acceptable," Cornelius says. "File them under 'Snacks'."

"And Sophia sent a check. A big one. Probably hush money."

"File it under 'Building Maintenance'."

Cornelius hops down. He adjusts his spectacles and looks at his apprentice. "You did well, Zephyr. Your cataloging of the hazardous materials (Liquid Fire) was... adequate."

Zeph beams. "Does that mean I get a raise?"

Cornelius fluffs his wings. "Let us not get carried away. But... you may have the afternoon off."

Zeph whoops and runs out into the sunlight. Cornelius watches him go. He looks around his domain. It is safe. It is ordered. But it is a little less lonely.

Cornelius picks up his quill. *Entry 09:00. Order Restored.*
