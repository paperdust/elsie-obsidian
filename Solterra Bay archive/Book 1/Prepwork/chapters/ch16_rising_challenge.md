# Chapter 16: The Spider's Web

**Summary**

It is the final night of the Feast. The noise outside is deafening, which is perfect for a break-in. Cornelius knows **Alexandros** will come tonight to retrieve the letters before the library reopens to the public tomorrow.

Cornelius and Zeph turn the library into a machine. They don't have weapons (dragons don't use swords), but they have **Index Physics**.
- They grease the floor of the main aisle with **Bookbinder's Wax**.
- They rig the rolling ladders to swing loose with a counterweight.
- They hide in the "Shadow Zone"—the darkest corner of the dome, directly above the intake chute where they suspect the letters are hidden.

**The Strategy:** Cornelius isn't strong enough to fight Alexandros (as proven in the alley). He needs to *contain* him until the Wards trap him.

Zeph is shaking. "What if he brings friends?"
Cornelius hands Zeph a whistle. "Then you blow this, and we pray Captain Mago is still angry about his unpaid debt."

**Word Count:** ~260 words.
