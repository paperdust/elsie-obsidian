# Chapter 15: The Second Intruder

**Summary**

Cornelius and Zeph put it together.
1.  **Sophia** bought Elias's services (The Argument).
2.  **Petros** was framed (The Code Note).
3.  **Alexandros** enforced the silence (The Threat).

**The Theory:** Sophia hired Elias to steal the letters to destroy the evidence of the Mistress (protecting family honor? or perhaps the letters prove *Petros* is illegitimate?). But Elias got greedy and tried to sell them to Eudora too.

Alexandros isn't the hired muscle; he is the **Cleaner**. He followed Elias into the vault. When Elias tried to double-cross them, Alexandros used the "Tile Kiln Accelerant" (chemical fire) to melt the lock and stun/kill Elias.

**The Twist:** It wasn't a heist gone wrong. It was an **Execution**.

They have the Why, the How, and the Who. Now they need the Where. The letters weren't on Elias. Alexandros didn't have them in the alley (no bag).

"They're still in the library," Cornelius whispers. "He hid them. He couldn't walk out with them because the Wards went back up."

**Word Count:** ~260 words.
