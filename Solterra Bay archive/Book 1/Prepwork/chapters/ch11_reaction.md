# Chapter 11: The Quiet

**Summary**

Cornelius and Zeph are hiding in the Library. The mob outside has dispersed, but the shame lingers. Cornelius is no longer the "Keeper of Knowledge"; he is the "Foreign Fool."

He retreats to his comfort zone: organizing. He starts re-shelving books, trying to find order in chaos. Zeph stops him. "We were wrong," Zeph says. "But why were we wrong?"

They re-examine the **Case Board**.
- **Petros:** Innocent (Alibi).
- **Mago:** Owed money, but didn't kill.
- **Sophia:** Has the motive (The Rivalry) and the means (The Scarf/Thread), but lacks the physical strength to melt a lock? Or does she?

Cornelius realizes he made a fundamental error: **Confirmation Bias**. He assumed the "Code Note" meant Petros was the thief. But if Elias *solicited* the note, then Elias was the active agent.

**New Theory:** Elias wasn't a victim; he was a partner. He was working *with* someone to steal the letters. And that someone betrayed him.

**Word Count:** ~240 words.
