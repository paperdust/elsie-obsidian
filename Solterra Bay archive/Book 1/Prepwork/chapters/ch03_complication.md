# Chapter 3: The Contamination

**Summary**

The sanctuary of the library is invaded by the Town Watch. **Captain Theo Melas (The Authority)** arrives, not with urgency, but with the weary slowness of a man who missed breakfast. He immediately clashes with Cornelius over "crime scene protocol." Theo treats the death of Elias as a procedural matter—likely a heart attack or accidental poisoning ("Sailors drink bad liquor, Dragon. It happens."). Cornelius is insulted by the lack of rigor.

Cornelius attempts to point out the **Lapis Flakes** and **Machine Oil** on the package wrapping, but Theo dismisses them as "dockside debris." He reminds Cornelius that dragons are *property*, not detectives, and orders him out of the vault.

The situation worsens with the arrival of **Sister Photine (Suspect E)** from the Temple of Althaia. She sweeps in to "bless the passing" and examine the body for the official death certificate. Cornelius observes her touching Elias's face and throat with unwashed hands, effectively contaminating any chemical residue on the skin. He notes that Photine seems less concerned with the soul and more concerned with the *skin condition* of the victim (checking for tell-tale red splotches). She declares it "Natural Causes exacerbated by heat," which closes the official investigation before it begins.

Cornelius notices a detail out of place: Photine is wearing new sandals, but the strap of one is mended with a distinct blue thread—the same shade of blue silk he saw on Sophia Doukas's dress.

The chapter ends with Theo sealing the vault *against* Cornelius ("Key remains with the Watch until the family claims the body"), effectively locking the dragon out of his own hoard.

**Word Count:** ~300 words.
