# Chapter 6: The Blue Glaze

**Summary**

The sun is blinding as Cornelius and Zeph arrive at the Doukas estate. It is a fortress of painted tiles, currently being prepped for the Feast's main party. They find **Sophia Doukas (Suspect B)** overseeing the installation of a massive mosaic. She is composed, regal, and utterly dismissive.

Cornelius uses his "Official Librarian" persona to question her about the package. Sophia denies knowing Elias, claiming he was just "a delivery boy." However, Cornelius uses his **Omniglot/Detail Vision** to spot two things:
1.  The hem of her blue dress is torn—and mended with the exact same thread he saw on Sister Photine's sandal.
2.  She is wearing a high-collared neck scarf in the heat (hiding bruises? or stress rash?).

When pressed about the argument in the square, Sophia cracks slightly. She admits she hired Elias to deliver a "sample" to the vault, but claims it was just a tile prototype. She wipes her brow with a **Monogrammed Handkerchief** (embroidered with a 'P'—for Petros? Or Photine?), then "accidentally" leaves it behind when called away by a servant.

Cornelius snatches the handkerchief. It smells of *Turpentine* (Art supplies) and... *Lilac* (Petros Kallistos's favorite cologne).

**Word Count:** ~250 words.
