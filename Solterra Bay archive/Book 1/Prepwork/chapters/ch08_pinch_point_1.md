# Chapter 8: The Red Tape

**Summary**

Returning to the Library, expecting to cross-reference the Kallistos accounts, Cornelius finds the doors barred. **Captain Theo Melas** stands guard.

"You're interfering, Drake," Theo says. "Harassing Lady Sophia. Threatening dock captains. You're done."

Theo serves Cornelius an official "Cease and Desist." The Library is now a restricted crime scene *until after the Feast*. Cornelius is effectively homeless and powerless. He tries to argue logic, but Theo uses the "Public Order" card.

Cornelius retreats to a rooftop, fuming. "They are erasing the truth," he tells Zeph.

**The Pinch:** Without access to the Vault or the Files, the investigation is dead.

**The Solution:** Zeph grins. "You know, the vents need cleaning. And I have a map." He pulls out the crumpled paper they took from **Petros** in Chapter 2. It wasn't just a map; it was a *maintenance schedule*.

Cornelius realizes Petros wasn't just hiding; he was *planning* a route.

"Zephyr," Cornelius says, "Tonight, we commit a felony."

**Word Count:** ~260 words.
