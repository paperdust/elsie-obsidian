# Chapter 18: Gravity

**Summary**

Zeph cuts the rope. The counter-weighted ladder swings down and crashes into the shelves behind Alexandros, blocking his exit.

"Library rules!" Cornelius roars, dropping from the rafters. "No loud noises!"

Alexandros spins, dropping into a combat crouch. He sees the dragon and the boy. He sneers. "You think a ladder stops me?"

He charges. But Cornelius didn't aim for *him*. He aimed for the floor. Alexandros hits the **Bookbinder's Wax** and loses his footing. He slides, crashing into a display case of heavy geological samples.

Zeph blows the whistle.

Alexandros recovers fast. He pulls a vial from his belt—**Liquid Fire**. He prepares to throw it at the books. "Let it burn," he snarls.

Cornelius has a choice: Save the books or catch the killer?
He chooses **Both**.

Cornelius uses his tail to sweep a heavy rug out from under Alexandros, sending the vial flying. It shatters on the stone floor, igniting a small patch of nothing distinct. Cornelius pins Alexandros with his claw, right on the chest.

"The fine for arson," Cornelius hisses, his face inches from the killer's, "is death. But I will settle for life in the iron mines."

The doors burst open. **Captain Theo Melas** arrives (alerted by Zeph's earlier signal).

**Word Count:** ~280 words.
