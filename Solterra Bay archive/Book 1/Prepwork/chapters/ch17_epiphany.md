# Chapter 17: The Silence Returns

**Summary**

They wait in the dark. The silence of the library is back, but it's different now. It's predatory.

Cornelius and Zeph whisper. Cornelius admits that he misjudged humans. "I thought you were all chaos," he says. "But chaos has a pattern. And you, Zephyr, break the pattern by being loyal."

It is the emotional climax of the subplot. Cornelius finally compliments Zeph—not on his dusting, but on his *character*.

**The Trigger:** A sound at the service door. The lock doesn't click; it *melts*. The smell of **Burnt Almond** wafts up.

Alexandros is here.

He enters, moving with practiced silence. He heads straight for the **Intake Chute**—confirming Cornelius's deduction. He reaches inside and pulls out a thin, oil-skin packet. **The Letters.**

"Now," Cornelius whispers.

**Word Count:** ~240 words.
