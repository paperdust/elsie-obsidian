# Chapter 2: The Broken Seal

**Summary**

The morning silence of the Solterra Bay Library is shattered not by noise, but by a wrongness in the air. Cornelius, intending to shelve the morning returns, discovers the door to the Kallistos Private Vault is ajar. The heavy bronze seal—supposedly unbreakable without the key—has been melted at the hinges.

Inside, the vault is silent. And empty. The shelf reserved for the "Kallistos Letters" (a collection of correspondence regarding the family's tile glaze history, or so it is believed) is bare.

On the floor lies Elias of Tyre. The courier is dead, his face frozen in an expression of surprise rather than pain. There is no blood, but a distinct smell of *ozone* and *burnt almond*—signatures of a magical stunning spell gone wrong, or perhaps a poison that acts on the nerves.

Cornelius's first instinct is preservation (of the library). He seals the room to prevent contamination. Zeph, arriving with his mop, provides the human reaction: pure panic. He points out something Cornelius missed in his focus on the letters: a figure lurking in the shadows of the Reference Section, just outside the vault.

It is **Petros Kallistos (Suspect D)**. He is disheveled, smelling of stale wine and sweat, and clutching a piece of paper that looks suspiciously like a map of the library's ventilation system. He claims he was "checking on the books" because he heard a noise, but his guilt is palpable.

As the commotion spills out into the main atrium, the crowd from the Feast begins to press against the glass doors. Among them, Zeph spots **Captain Mago (Suspect C)**, who isn't looking at the festivities, but staring intently at the library windows with a look of grim satisfaction.

The Equilibrium is broken. The sanctuary has been violated. The Letters are stolen, a man is dead, and the Library is now a crime scene.
