# Chapter 19: The Inventory

**Summary**

The Library is lit up. Theo Melas has Alexandros in chains. Sophia Doukas has been dragged out of bed and brought to the scene. Even Mago is there (lurking).

Cornelius holds up the packet of letters. "The *Kallistos Letters*," he announces. "Not a glaze recipe, Lady Eudora. But proof that the late Lord Kallistos had an affair... with a Doukas."

Sophia goes pale.

Cornelius explains: "Sophia hired Elias to steal them to protect her family's honor (or perhaps claim an inheritance?). But Elias got greedy. He tried to sell them back to the Kallistos family (Petros) *and* to Eudora. Alexandros, the loyal family cleaner, found out. He followed Elias into the vault and silenced him."

Sophia looks at Alexandros. "You killed him?" she whispers. "I only said to *stop* him."

"He was a loose end," Alexandros says coldly. "Like the Dragon."

Theo takes the letters. "These are evidence," he says. But he looks at Cornelius with respect. "Good work, Consultant."
