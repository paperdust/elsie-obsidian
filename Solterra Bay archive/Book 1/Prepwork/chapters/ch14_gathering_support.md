# Chapter 14: The Love Letters

**Summary**

Cornelius limps back to the library. He needs to understand *why*. Why steal letters for a Glaze Recipe?

He finds **Imelda Kassiani**, the Head Librarian and the only person Cornelius fears (and loves). She is tending the rare book section, her silver braids swaying as she works. He asks her about the "Kallistos Letters."

Imelda sighs, a sound of ancient patience. "Glaze recipes? Oh, Cornelius. You always look for the pattern and miss the heart." She reveals the truth: "Those were letters to his mistress. I cataloged them myself forty years ago, under 'Private Correspondence: Do Not Circulate'."

**The Twist:** The letters aren't industrial espionage. They are blackmail material. Or... proof of lineage?

Cornelius realizes the "Kallistos Formula" Eudora wanted was a lie Elias told her to get the deposit. But the *Real Thief* (Alexandros) wanted them for a different reason.

Cornelius finds Zeph sleeping on the library steps, refusing to go home despite the fight. They reconcile. "I met the bad guy," Cornelius says. "And he smells like burnt almonds."

Zeph grins sleepy. "Cyanide?"

"No," Cornelius realizes. "**Tile Kiln accelerant.**"

**Word Count:** ~250 words.
