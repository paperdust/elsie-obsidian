## Chapter 15 State

**CHAPTER SUMMARY**
- **Action:** Deduction Session.
- **Theory Finalized:** "The Execution." Elias tried to double-cross Sophia/Alexandros. Alexandros killed him.
- **Logic:** The Wards trap objects as well as people. If Alexandros fled after the murder (before sunset?), he might have left the book.
- **Twist:** The Letters are still in the Library.

**DECISIONS MADE**
- **Cornelius:** Decides to search the library for the hidden letters before Alexandros returns for them.

**STATE CHANGES**
- **Internal Axis (Cornelius):** +5 -> +9 (Hunter). He knows where the hoard is.
- **Relationship Axis (Zeph):** +8 -> +9 (Ready).
- **Entropy:** 4 -> 2 (High Order/Tension).

**THRESHOLD STATUS**
- **Act 3 Climax:** CROSSED.
- **Next Threshold:** Act 4 (The Showdown).

**KNOWLEDGE UPDATES**
- **Fact:** The motive was silencing Elias/Destroying Lineage proof.
- **Prediction:** Alexandros will come back for the letters.

**NEXT CHAPTER SETUP**
- **Primary Pressure:** Trap Alexandros.
- **Objective:** Find the letters first and set the stage.
