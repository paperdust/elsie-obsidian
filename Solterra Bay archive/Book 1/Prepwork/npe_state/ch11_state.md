## Chapter 11 State

**CHAPTER SUMMARY**
- **Action:** Hiding in the Library. Regrouping.
- **Analysis:** Deconstructing the failure.
- **New Insight:** Elias was an *active participant* (Partner), not a passive victim.
- **Pivot:** Stop looking for "Who killed Elias?" and start looking for "Who was Elias working with?"

**DECISIONS MADE**
- **Cornelius:** Admits he was wrong (Humility). Allows Zeph to lead the brainstorming.

**STATE CHANGES**
- **Internal Axis (Cornelius):** -8 (Humiliated) -> -4 (Focused). The puzzle grounds him.
- **Relationship Axis (Zeph):** +4 -> +6 (Re-calibrated). Zeph sees Cornelius is willing to learn.
- **Entropy:** 9 -> 7 (Cooling). The chaos is manageable again.

**THRESHOLD STATUS**
- **Investigating:** The "Partner" Theory.
- **Next Threshold:** Re-interviewing the outliers (Eudora).

**KNOWLEDGE UPDATES**
- **Theory:** The Killer was Elias's partner.
- **Question:** Who needed the letters enough to hire a courier to steal them?

**NEXT CHAPTER SETUP**
- **Primary Pressure:** Time. The Feast ends soon.
- **Objective:** Talk to Eudora again. She knew Elias was "working."
