# Chapter 6

The Doukas estate smelled wrong.

Cornelius had known it would. Tile workshops always did—clay dust, turpentine, the acrid bite of kiln smoke. But knowing did not make it easier to tolerate. He stood at the iron gates, his wings folded tight against his sides, and resisted the urge to sneeze.

"You okay?" Zeph asked. The boy had dressed in plain cotton today, as instructed. No bright colors. Nothing that would draw attention. He looked like half the other youths in the market district—lanky, ordinary, forgettable.

Perfect.

"I am fine." Cornelius adjusted his spectacles with one claw. "The air quality here is simply... industrial."

"It's a tile workshop. What'd you expect?"

"I expected ceramic production residue. I did not expect to *taste* it." Cornelius's tongue flicked out involuntarily, sampling the air. Clay. Silica. Something sharp and chemical that coated the back of his throat. "No matter. We proceed."

The estate itself was a monument to House Doukas's ambitions. The outer walls were covered in decorative tiles—geometric patterns in blue and white and gold, each piece fitted with such precision that the mortar lines were nearly invisible. The gates bore the Doukas spiral emblem in wrought iron. Beyond them, a courtyard stretched toward a two-story main house, also tiled, also gleaming.

New money, trying very hard to look like old money.

Cornelius had seen this pattern before. The Doukas family had risen in the last two generations on the strength of artistic innovation and aggressive contracts. They produced fewer tiles than the Veneti workshops but commanded higher prices for custom work. Temples. Council chambers. Wealthy homes.

And they *hated* House Kallistos with a passion that was now, very possibly, criminal.

Cornelius approached the gate and pulled the bell cord.

A servant appeared—human, middle-aged, wearing a blue tunic embroidered with the spiral. He looked down at Cornelius with the expression of someone who had been interrupted during important work.

"The workshop is closed to visitors during the Feast," he said.

"I am not a visitor. I am Cornelius Drake, Curator of the Solterra Bay Library. I am here to speak with Sophia Doukas regarding a matter of legal significance."

The servant's expression shifted. Not quite respect, but caution. "Does she expect you?"

"She should." Cornelius kept his voice crisp and formal. "The Watch has opened an inquiry into the death of Elias of Tyre. Sophia Doukas was seen speaking with the deceased the day before his death. I am conducting follow-up interviews on behalf of the investigation."

It was not precisely a lie. He *was* investigating. And Theo *had* opened an inquiry, even if he had then promptly closed it.

The servant hesitated, then unlocked the gate. "Wait in the courtyard. I will see if Mistress Sophia is available."

He disappeared into the main house.

Cornelius stepped through the gate with Zeph close behind. The courtyard was paved in tiles—of course it was—arranged in a spiral pattern that radiated from a central fountain. The fountain itself was dry, its basin filled with ceramic scraps and broken tools.

Even their courtyard was a work-in-progress showcase.

"Fancy," Zeph muttered. He was looking up at the house. "Lot of tile."

"House Doukas believes in advertising their craft." Cornelius moved toward the fountain and studied the broken pieces in the basin. Curved shards. Test glazes in half a dozen colors. The remnants of failed experiments. "They want everyone who enters to see their skill."

"And their money."

"That, too."

Footsteps echoed from the house. Not the servant returning.

Heavier. More deliberate.

Cornelius turned.

Sophia Doukas descended the front steps with the posture of someone walking onto a stage. She was tall for a human woman, perhaps fifty years old, with dark hair streaked with gray and pulled back in a severe braid. Her dress was deep blue linen—the same shade as the thread Cornelius had seen on Sister Photine's sandal—and her hands were stained with glaze residue.

She stopped at the base of the steps and regarded Cornelius with the expression one might use when discovering mold on bread.

"Curator," she said. The title sounded like an insult. "I was told you wished to speak with me."

"I do." Cornelius stepped away from the fountain and faced her directly. "I am investigating the circumstances surrounding the death of Elias of Tyre. I have reason to believe you can provide relevant information."

Sophia's gaze flicked to Zeph, then back to Cornelius. "The Watch already spoke with me. I told Captain Melas everything I know."

"Which was?"

"Very little." She crossed her arms. "Elias was a courier. I hired him once to deliver a sample to a client in the port district. That is the extent of our association."

Cornelius's tail curled. She was lying. Or at minimum, omitting.

"When did you hire him?" he asked.

"Two weeks ago. Perhaps three. I do not track such details."

"And you have not seen him since?"

"No."

Cornelius let the silence stretch. He watched Sophia's face, her posture, the small movements of her hands. She stood very still, but her fingers twitched slightly against her arms.

Nervous.

"That is curious," Cornelius said. "Because you were seen speaking with Elias in the Feast market on Day One. Three days ago. The conversation appeared... heated."

Sophia's jaw tightened. "I do not recall."

"You do not recall arguing with a man in the public square two days before his death?"

"I speak with many people during the Feast. Suppliers. Clients. Guild representatives." Her voice sharpened. "If I had a 'heated conversation,' it was likely about a late shipment or substandard materials. Nothing of criminal significance."

Cornelius tilted his head. "I did not say the matter was criminal."

Sophia's hands clenched. "Elias is dead. You are here asking questions. What else would it be?"

"That is what I am attempting to determine." Cornelius stepped closer. He was small—barely the size of a large cat—but he had learned long ago that size mattered less than certainty. "You argued with a courier. The courier is now dead. The death occurred during a theft at my library. You will forgive me if I find the coincidence... noteworthy."

"I had nothing to do with any theft."

"I did not say you did."

Sophia's face flushed. "Then what are you implying?"

"I am not implying. I am *observing*." Cornelius let his wings unfold slightly, catching the light. "And I observe that you are far more defensive than someone with 'very little' connection to the deceased ought to be."

Behind him, Zeph shifted his weight. Cornelius could feel the boy's attention like a tether, steady and waiting.

Sophia's gaze darted to Zeph again, then back to Cornelius. She was calculating. Deciding how much to say.

Finally, she exhaled. "Fine. Yes. I saw Elias in the market. He owed me money for a prior delivery that he failed to complete. I demanded payment. He refused. We argued. That is all."

"What delivery?"

"A commission to a buyer in the upper city. Elias was supposed to deliver ceramic inserts for a mosaic panel. He claimed the buyer was unavailable and returned the pieces to me. I suspected he simply did not want to make the climb."

"And this argument took place the day before he died."

"Yes."

"And you did not think to mention this to Captain Melas when he interviewed you?"

"Why would I? A financial dispute over a failed delivery has nothing to do with his death." Sophia's voice was ice now. "Unless you are accusing me of murder, Curator, I suggest you take your questions elsewhere."

Cornelius studied her.

The flush in her cheeks. The tightness in her jaw. The way her hands kept clenching and unclenching against her arms.

Anger. Yes.

But also fear.

He had rattled her.

"I am not accusing you of anything," Cornelius said smoothly. "I am simply gathering information. The Watch's investigation was... cursory. I am ensuring no details were overlooked."

"How thorough." Sophia's tone could have frozen wine. "Is there anything else, or may I return to my work?"

Cornelius let his gaze drift deliberately over her appearance. The blue dress. The glaze stains on her hands. The—

He stopped.

There.

Around her neck, a scarf of pale cream linen, knotted loosely at the throat. It did not match the dress. Did not match her aesthetic at all. And it sat strangely, as though covering something.

Bruises? A rash?

Or simply the self-consciousness of someone trying to hide stress?

And lower, at the hem of her dress—

The blue thread.

The same blue thread he had seen on Sister Photine's sandal.

It was fresh. Newly sewn. A line of careful stitches mending a small tear along the hem, the thread chosen to blend with the dress fabric but not quite matching. A rush job. Something done quickly, perhaps early this morning.

The same thread.

The same *exact* thread.

Cornelius's mind raced. Thread was not unique. Many people used blue thread. But this shade—deep cobalt with a slight sheen—was distinctive. And to find it in two places connected to his investigation?

Not a coincidence.

"Your dress is beautiful," Cornelius said. His voice was light, conversational. "House Doukas work?"

Sophia blinked at the sudden shift. "What?"

"The embroidery. The cut. It is clearly a custom piece. I wondered if it was produced in your own workshop or commissioned elsewhere."

"I—" Sophia glanced down at herself. "It is mine. I designed it."

"And the mending?" Cornelius gestured with one claw toward the hem. "The blue thread along the bottom. Was that also your work?"

Sophia's hand moved instinctively to the hem. "I tore it yesterday. Caught it on a kiln grate. I repaired it this morning. Why does that matter?"

"It does not. I simply appreciate craftsmanship." Cornelius adjusted his spectacles. "The thread is quite fine. Imported?"

"Local. From the dyer in the lower market." Sophia's voice had turned wary again. "Curator, if you are finished with your... observations, I really must return to work. The Feast contracts wait for no one."

"Of course." Cornelius inclined his head. "One last question."

"What?"

"Did Elias ever mention why he was at the library the day he died?"

Sophia froze.

It was just a moment. A single heartbeat. But Cornelius saw it—the way her breath caught, the way her shoulders stiffened.

"No," she said. "I told you. I barely knew him."

"But you argued with him. About payment."

"About a failed delivery. Not about the library."

"Yet he died there. In a vault. After delivering a package that has since been stolen." Cornelius kept his tone mild, curious. "You can see why I find your connection to him... interesting."

"There is no connection." Sophia's voice rose. "I hired a courier. The courier failed to complete a job. I demanded payment. That is the beginning and end of my involvement. If he died in your library, that is your problem, not mine."

"Indeed." Cornelius studied her. The flush had spread to her neck now, visible above the cream scarf. Her hands were trembling slightly. "Thank you for your time, Mistress Doukas. You have been very... informative."

Sophia turned and stalked back toward the house. Her steps were fast, tight, controlled.

She was halfway up the stairs when her hand went to her pocket.

And then she stopped.

Turned.

Looked down at the courtyard tiles.

A small square of fabric lay on the ground between where she had been standing and where Cornelius now stood. White linen. Embroidered in one corner.

A handkerchief.

It must have fallen from her pocket when she moved.

Sophia started back down the steps.

Zeph moved first.

"I've got it," he said cheerfully. He strode forward and scooped up the handkerchief before Sophia could reach it. "You dropped this, Mistress."

He held it out.

Sophia snatched it from his hand. "Thank you."

But Cornelius had seen it.

Just for a moment, as Zeph lifted it. The embroidery in the corner.

A monogram.

A single letter, stitched in dark thread.

*P.*

Sophia shoved the handkerchief back into her pocket and disappeared into the house without another word.

The servant reappeared and gestured toward the gate. "If you are finished...?"

"Yes. Thank you." Cornelius turned and walked toward the exit with as much dignity as he could muster while his mind spun in three directions at once.

Zeph followed, silent until they were through the gate and back on the street.

"So," Zeph said. "She's lying."

"Emphatically." Cornelius's claws clicked against the cobblestones as he moved down the street, away from the estate. "She hired Elias. She argued with him. She knows more than she is saying."

"Yeah, but we already knew that. Did we learn anything new?"

Cornelius glanced back at the estate. The tiled walls. The dry fountain. The house where Sophia Doukas was undoubtedly pacing and worrying and wondering what Cornelius had seen.

"Yes," he said. "The thread."

"What thread?"

"The blue thread on her hem. It matches the thread I saw on Sister Photine's sandal during the body examination." Cornelius's tail curled in satisfaction. "They share a thread source. Which means they share a location. Or a supplier. Or—"

"Or Photine mended Sophia's dress," Zeph said.

Cornelius stopped walking. "What?"

"I mean, healers sew, right? Stitches and stuff. Maybe Sophia tore her dress and Photine fixed it. They could be friends."

Cornelius considered this.

It was plausible. Infuriatingly plausible.

But it still meant a connection. Sophia and Photine, linked by thread and proximity. And Photine had certified Elias's death as natural causes despite clear evidence of poison.

"Perhaps," Cornelius said. "But it remains a connection worth noting."

"What about the handkerchief?"

"What about it?"

"The monogram. You saw it, right? The letter?"

"Yes. *P.*" Cornelius resumed walking, his mind already assembling the pieces. "Which could stand for several names. Photine. Or..."

"Or?"

"Petros Kallistos."

Zeph stopped. "Wait. The drunk guy? The one who owned the vault?"

"Yes." Cornelius's wings flared slightly. "Sophia Doukas carries a handkerchief monogrammed with a *P*. Petros Kallistos was found in the library archive with a ventilation schematic he cannot explain. Both are connected to the theft. Both have means and motive."

"You think they're working together?"

"I think it is a hypothesis worth exploring." Cornelius turned down a side street, heading back toward the library. "House Doukas and House Kallistos are rivals. Bitter rivals. But what if that rivalry is a performance? What if they are secretly collaborating?"

"Why would they do that?"

"I do not know yet. But the handkerchief suggests a personal connection. Something beyond business." Cornelius's mind raced. "A romance, perhaps. Or blackmail. Or—"

He stopped.

Turned.

"Zeph. When you picked up the handkerchief. Did you notice anything else about it?"

Zeph frowned. "Like what?"

"A scent. A texture. Anything."

"Uh..." Zeph thought. "It smelled kind of... flowery? And also like paint thinner."

Cornelius's claws dug into the cobblestones.

Flowery.

Lilac.

Petros Kallistos had reeked of lilac water the day they found him in the archive. An expensive scent. The kind worn by wealthy men trying to cover the smell of wine and poor decisions.

And paint thinner—turpentine. The same scent that permeated the Doukas estate.

The handkerchief carried both.

Which meant it had been in contact with both Petros and Sophia.

Cornelius turned and began walking again, faster now. "We are returning to the library."

"Why? What's wrong?"

"Nothing is wrong. Everything is *right*." Cornelius's tail lashed. "The handkerchief links Sophia to Petros. The blue thread links Sophia to Photine. And we already know Petros provided vault information to a stranger at a tavern. The pieces are connecting."

"So what do we do?"

"We document." Cornelius's wings folded tight with satisfaction. "And then we find proof."

"Proof of what?"

"That Sophia Doukas and Petros Kallistos conspired to rob his own family's vault." Cornelius's voice was firm. Certain. "She had the means—access to alchemical materials through her workshop. He had the access—his own family's vault. Together, they planned the theft. Hired Elias as their tool. And when something went wrong, they eliminated him."

"With poison."

"With poison." Cornelius nodded. "Certified as natural causes by a healer who shares Sophia's thread supplier and is therefore likely part of the conspiracy."

Zeph was quiet for a moment. Then he said, "That's... a lot of conspiracy."

"It is a logical chain of evidence." Cornelius adjusted his spectacles. "And I intend to prove every link."

They walked in silence for several blocks, threading through the Feast crowds. The market square was loud today—drums and flutes and the crash of barrels being unloaded at the docks. Cornelius ignored it all. His mind was already back at the library, drafting the new entry in his incident log.

*Sophia Doukas: Confirmed liar. Confirmed connection to Elias. Carries handkerchief monogrammed 'P' (Petros Kallistos?) smelling of lilac and turpentine. Blue thread on dress matches thread observed on Sister Photine's sandal during body examination. Hypothesis: Sophia and Petros are co-conspirators. Photine is complicit in cover-up.*

The pattern was emerging. Clear. Undeniable.

He just needed one more piece of evidence to make it irrefutable.

They reached the library. Cornelius unlocked the front door and stepped into the cool, quiet sanctuary of his domain. The vanilla-and-dust scent settled over him like a balm after the industrial assault of the Doukas estate.

Home.

He moved to his desk and retrieved his private ledger, flipping to the suspect web he had drawn the night before.

Sophia Doukas.

Petros Kallistos.

Sister Photine.

He drew a new line connecting Sophia to Petros. Labeled it: *Handkerchief. Lilac + Turpentine.*

Then another line connecting Sophia to Photine. Labeled it: *Blue thread. Shared supplier or direct contact.*

The web was tightening.

Zeph leaned over his shoulder. "You really think it's them?"

"I think the evidence points in that direction." Cornelius set down his pen. "But evidence is not proof. Not yet. We need something concrete. Something Theo cannot dismiss."

"Like what?"

"Like the stolen correspondence. Or the tool used to melt the vault seal. Or a witness who saw them together." Cornelius tapped the page. "We have fragments. We need the whole picture."

"So we keep watching."

"Yes. We keep watching." Cornelius closed the ledger and locked it in his desk drawer. "But now we know where to watch. Sophia will make a mistake. They always do. And when she does, we will be ready."

Zeph nodded. He looked tired. They had been awake since before dawn, walking to the Doukas estate, conducting the interview, walking back.

"Go home," Cornelius said. "Eat. Rest. Return tonight and we will plan the next phase."

"You sure?"

"Yes. I have documentation to complete. And you have been standing for three hours." Cornelius gestured toward the door. "Go. I will be fine."

Zeph hesitated, then nodded. "Okay. But if anything happens—"

"I will send word."

"Promise?"

"I promise."

Zeph left, pulling the door shut behind him.

Cornelius stood alone in his library, surrounded by shelves and silence.

He moved to the supply cabinet and retrieved his incident log, carrying it back to the desk.

But before he opened it, he reached into his pocket.

His claws closed around a small square of fabric.

White linen. Soft. Expensive.

He had taken it while Sophia was distracted. While Zeph was handing her the decoy handkerchief—the one she had dropped and reclaimed.

This was the real one.

The one Zeph had palmed and passed to Cornelius in the moment Sophia turned away.

The boy was clever. Cornelius would have to remember to praise him for that later.

He spread the handkerchief on his desk and studied the embroidery in the corner.

The monogram was dark blue thread. Precise stitching. Professionally done, not a personal touch.

*P.*

Cornelius lifted the fabric to his face and inhaled carefully.

Lilac. Faint but unmistakable. The same scent Petros had worn.

And beneath it, sharper—turpentine. The chemical bite of Sophia's workshop.

The handkerchief had been in contact with both of them.

Which meant they had been in contact with each other.

Recently.

Cornelius folded the handkerchief and placed it carefully between two blank pages in his incident log. Evidence. Material. Concrete.

He opened the log to a fresh page and began to write.

*Spring Feast, Day Three. Morning.*

*Interview with Sophia Doukas at the Doukas estate. Subject was evasive and defensive. Admitted to arguing with Elias over a failed delivery but denied any connection to his death or the library theft.*

*Physical observations:*

*- Cream scarf worn at throat (unusual for her style; possibly concealing stress marks or injury).*

*- Fresh mending on dress hem using distinctive blue thread, identical to thread observed on Sister Photine's sandal.*

*- Dropped handkerchief bearing monogram 'P' and scents of lilac (associated with Petros Kallistos) and turpentine (workshop chemical).*

*Conclusion: Sophia Doukas and Petros Kallistos are personally connected. The nature of the connection remains unclear (romantic? conspiratorial?) but is materially relevant to the theft and Elias's death.*

*Next steps: Determine the relationship between Sophia and Petros. Identify the source of the 'P' monogram. Locate the stolen correspondence.*

Cornelius set down his pen and leaned back in his chair.

The pieces were falling into place.

Slowly. Methodically. Exactly as they should.

And soon—very soon—he would have enough to present an irrefutable case.

Not to Theo. Theo had already demonstrated his inadequacy.

But to someone who mattered. The Council. The Guild. The families themselves.

Justice would be served.

And Cornelius would prove that a dragon who ran a library could also be a dragon who solved murders.

He folded his wings and looked up at the amber dome, the light filtering through the glass in soft, steady patterns.

Outside, the Feast raged on.

But inside, order was being restored.

One careful observation at a time.
