# Chapter 7

The docks smelled wrong.

Not wrong the way the Doukas estate had smelled wrong—industrial and chemical and specific. This was a different kind of assault. A *layered* assault.

Salt. Fish guts. Damp wool. The sharp, medicinal bite of anise liquor. Tar. Rope. Sweat. And beneath it all, the wet-stone funk of the harbor itself, where seawater pooled between cobblestones and rotted planks.

Cornelius stopped at the edge of the market district and stared down the sloping street toward the docks.

"You okay?" Zeph asked.

"I am reconsidering the wisdom of this expedition."

"We're already here."

"Yes. Unfortunately." Cornelius's tongue flicked out involuntarily, sampling the air. He regretted it immediately. The taste coated the back of his throat like old fish oil. "I despise the docks."

"You despise everything that's not the library."

"Untrue. I tolerate many things. The archive. The mint vendor. Clean parchment." Cornelius adjusted his spectacles and forced himself to continue down the cobblestones. "I simply prefer environments that do not *assault* the senses."

Zeph grinned. "Yeah, but Mago's ship is down here. And you said he's the guy Petros talked to at the tavern, right? The one who asked about the vault?"

"It is a reasonable hypothesis." Cornelius stepped carefully over a puddle of something he refused to identify. "Petros described a 'large, eastern-accented man.' Mago Hanno fits that description. He was also observed watching the library the morning after the crime. And he is a known smuggler with access to restricted goods."

"Like fireworks."

"Among other things." Cornelius's tail curled. "Fireworks contain accelerants. Accelerants produce the kind of heat necessary to melt iron. Therefore, Mago is a potential source for the tool used to breach the vault."

"Or he's just the guy who bought Elias drinks and asked nosy questions."

"That is also possible." Cornelius sidestepped a coil of rope lying across the walkway. "Which is why we are here. To determine which hypothesis is correct."

The street widened as it approached the harbor, opening onto a broad cobblestone plaza lined with warehouses and taverns. Ships crowded the docks—merchant vessels, fishing boats, sleek trading galleons from the southern ports. The Spring Feast had drawn them all in like moths to flame, and the plaza roared with activity.

Sailors hauled crates. Merchants shouted prices. A trio of gulls fought over something unidentifiable near a stack of barrels.

Cornelius's wings folded tight against his sides.

Too loud. Too chaotic. Too many *people*.

Zeph pointed toward a building near the end of the dock. "That's The Gilded Gull. The bouncer there knows everyone who comes through. If Mago's around, he'll know where."

"How do you know that?"

"My cousin works the fishmonger stall. She says the Gull's where all the captains drink."

Cornelius studied the tavern. It was a squat, two-story structure built directly into the harbor wall, with walls stained dark from years of salt spray. A wooden sign hung above the door—a gull painted in flaking gold leaf, wings spread wide.

"Very well. Lead the way."

Zeph wove through the crowd with the easy confidence of someone who had grown up in these streets. Cornelius followed, staying close and resisting the urge to hiss at anyone who stepped too near.

The Gilded Gull's interior was dim and smelled overwhelmingly of anise. Cornelius's nose wrinkled. Ouzo. The local liquor. It permeated everything—the wooden bar, the tables, even the air itself.

A dozen patrons sat scattered throughout the room. Sailors, mostly. A few merchants. One very tired-looking dockworker slumped over a bowl of soup.

Behind the bar, a broad-shouldered orc woman with graying hair and a scarred jaw wiped down glasses with a rag that had seen better days. She glanced up as Cornelius and Zeph entered, her gaze lingering on Cornelius for a moment before returning to her work.

Zeph approached the bar. "Excuse me. We're looking for Captain Mago Hanno. Is he around?"

The orc woman set down her glass. "Who's asking?"

"We are," Cornelius said. He hopped onto a barstool—it took two tries and was deeply undignified—and met her gaze directly. "I am Cornelius Drake, Curator of the Solterra Bay Library. I need to speak with Captain Mago regarding a matter of legal significance."

The woman's expression did not change. "Library business at the docks. That's new."

"It is a unique situation."

She studied him for a long moment, then jerked her head toward the door. "His ship's the *Erinyes*. Berth seven. Big black hull, red sails. You can't miss it."

"Thank you." Cornelius slid off the stool—also undignified—and turned toward the exit.

"Curator," the woman said.

He stopped.

"Mago don't like surprises. And he *really* don't like people poking into his business." Her gaze flicked to Zeph. "You might want to leave the kid here."

"The 'kid' is my associate. He accompanies me."

The woman shrugged. "Your funeral."

Cornelius did not dignify that with a response. He walked out of the tavern with Zeph close behind.

The docks proper stretched out before them—a maze of wooden piers and mooring posts extending into the harbor. Ships of all sizes bobbed in the water, their masts swaying slightly with the rhythm of the tide.

Berth seven was at the far end, near the harbor wall.

And the *Erinyes* was exactly as described.

The ship was large—a three-masted trading galleon with a black-painted hull and sails the color of dried blood. The name was stenciled across the stern in white letters. On deck, a handful of crew members moved about, securing cargo and adjusting rigging.

And standing at the gangplank, arms crossed and watching their approach, was Captain Mago Hanno.

He was exactly as Cornelius remembered from their brief, silent confrontation two days ago. Tall—easily seven feet. Broad. Scarred. His tusks were capped in silver, and his hair was pulled back in a tight braid threaded with bone beads. He wore a long coat of dark leather, salt-stained and patched in a dozen places.

He looked like a man who had seen violence and was comfortable with it.

Cornelius stopped at the base of the gangplank and lifted his chin. "Captain Mago Hanno."

Mago's gaze shifted from Cornelius to Zeph, then back to Cornelius. "Curator."

"I wish to speak with you."

"So I gathered." Mago's voice was a low rumble, heavily accented—eastern ports, exactly as Petros had described. "You walked all the way down here. You got my attention. Now what?"

"I am investigating the death of Elias of Tyre. I have reason to believe you may have information relevant to the case."

Mago's expression did not change. "You working for the Watch now?"

"I am working independently."

"That a fact." Mago tilted his head slightly. "And what makes you think I got anything to say about some dead courier?"

"You were observed watching the library the morning after his death. You fit the description of a man seen speaking with Petros Kallistos at a tavern shortly before the crime. And Elias was killed during a theft involving materials you are known to traffic." Cornelius kept his voice level. Professional. "I do not believe in coincidences of that magnitude."

Mago stared at him for a long moment. Then, unexpectedly, he laughed. It was a short, sharp sound, more bark than humor.

"You got stones, Curator. I'll give you that." He gestured up the gangplank. "Come on, then. You want to talk, we talk. But not out here where every fishwife can hear."

Cornelius hesitated.

Walking onto Mago's ship meant entering the captain's territory. His domain. A place where the law of the docks—murky at best—held more weight than the law of the city.

Dangerous.

But also necessary.

Cornelius climbed the gangplank. His claws clicked against the wood. Zeph followed, and Cornelius could feel the boy's nervousness in the way he walked—tight steps, hands shoved in his pockets.

The deck of the *Erinyes* was organized chaos. Crates stacked along the rails. Coils of rope. Barrels lashed to the mast. The crew—three orcs and two humans—watched them pass with varying degrees of curiosity and suspicion.

Mago led them toward the stern, stopping near a hatch that led below deck. He turned and leaned against a crate, arms crossed.

"All right. You got your private conversation. Talk."

Cornelius folded his wings. "What was your relationship with Elias of Tyre?"

"He owed me money."

"How much?"

"Enough." Mago's gaze was flat. Unreadable. "Kid had a gambling problem. Dice, cards, anything with odds. He'd bet on whether the tide came in. Lost more than he won."

"And you extended him credit."

"I extend everyone credit. That's how business works." Mago's tusks gleamed faintly in the dim light. "But I also collect. Always."

"Did Elias repay you?"

"He was working on it."

"How?"

Mago studied him. "You already know, don't you? That's why you're here."

"I have a theory. I would prefer confirmation."

"I bet you would." Mago shifted his weight, the crate creaking beneath him. "Fine. Elias said he had a job lined up. Big payout. Enough to clear his debt and then some. He just needed a little more time."

"What job?"

"Didn't say. Didn't ask. Wasn't my business as long as he paid."

"And did he pay?"

Mago's expression darkened. "No. He died before he could."

Cornelius's claws dug into the wood of the deck. "When did he tell you about this 'job'?"

"Two weeks ago. Maybe three. He came to the Gull, nervous as a cat in a kennel. Said he had an opportunity. Something valuable. *Kallistos gold*, he called it."

Cornelius's wings flared slightly.

Kallistos gold.

Not literal gold. The Kallistos vault did not store currency. It stored *correspondence*. Letters. Contracts. Documents.

But to the right buyer, those could be worth more than gold.

Family secrets. Trade agreements. Blackmail material.

"Did he specify what he meant by 'Kallistos gold'?" Cornelius asked carefully.

"No. And I didn't ask. Just told him I wanted my money by the end of the Feast or his luck would run out permanently." Mago's voice was matter-of-fact. "Guess it ran out early."

Zeph shifted beside Cornelius. "So you were gonna kill him if he didn't pay?"

Mago's gaze locked onto Zeph. "I was gonna collect. One way or another. Whether that meant money or knees is a question we didn't get to answer."

Cornelius stepped slightly forward, placing himself between Mago and Zeph. "Elias died in my library. During a theft. The stolen items match what you described as 'Kallistos gold.' You were seen watching the library the morning after. Explain."

"Nothing to explain. I heard a courier died at the library. I knew Elias was working as a courier. I went to see if it was him." Mago shrugged. "It was. So I wrote off the debt and moved on."

"You expect me to believe you had no involvement in the theft?"

"I expect you to believe what you want, Curator. I'm just telling you facts." Mago leaned forward slightly. "Elias owed me money. He promised to pay using something he planned to steal from the Kallistos vault. He died before he could finish the job. I didn't kill him. I didn't hire him. I just gave him a deadline he didn't meet."

Cornelius studied the orc's face. The scars. The flat, unapologetic gaze.

He was telling the truth.

Or at least, a version of it.

Mago had not orchestrated the theft. But he had been the *pressure*. The threat that pushed Elias into desperation.

And desperation made people do dangerous things.

Like agreeing to rob a warded vault.

Like trusting the wrong people.

Like dying on a library floor with poison in their lungs.

"Thank you for your candor," Cornelius said. His voice was cold. Controlled. "That will be all."

"That's it? You're done?"

"I have the information I came for."

Mago laughed again, that short, humorless bark. "You got spine, Curator. I'll give you that. Most people don't walk onto my ship and interrogate me."

"Most people are not investigating a murder in their sanctuary."

"Fair." Mago straightened. "You need anything else, you know where to find me. But next time, maybe send a message first. Showing up unannounced is bad for business."

Cornelius turned toward the gangplank.

And stopped.

Zeph was staring at something near the hatch.

Cornelius followed his gaze.

There, partially visible through the open hatch, was a crate. Wooden. Unmarked except for a single symbol burned into the side—a stylized flame.

And through the slats, Cornelius could see the distinctive red-and-gold wrapping of firework charges.

Illegal fireworks.

The kind banned within city limits because of their volatility and the accelerants used in their construction.

The kind that could melt iron.

Cornelius's mind raced.

Mago trafficked in restricted goods. Fireworks were restricted goods. The vault seal had been melted using an accelerant.

The connection was circumstantial. But it was *there*.

Mago noticed where Zeph was looking. His expression shifted, the casual openness draining into something colder.

"You got a problem, kid?"

Zeph swallowed. "No. Just... looking."

"Look somewhere else."

"We are leaving." Cornelius's voice was firm. He moved toward the gangplank and gestured for Zeph to follow. "Thank you for your time, Captain."

But Mago stepped between them and the gangplank.

He did not move aggressively. Did not draw a weapon. Did not raise his voice.

He just *stood there*.

And somehow, that was more menacing than any overt threat.

"You know," Mago said quietly, "I don't mind questions. Questions are part of doing business. But I *do* mind people poking around my cargo. Especially people who might go running to the Watch about what they see."

"I have no intention of—"

"Sure you don't." Mago's gaze shifted to Zeph. "Kid, you seem smart. Smarter than your boss, maybe. So let me give you some advice. The docks are dangerous. Accidents happen. Cargo shifts. People fall off piers. You understand?"

Zeph's face went pale.

Cornelius's wings flared.

"Do not," Cornelius said, his voice dropping into a register he rarely used, "threaten my apprentice."

Mago's gaze snapped to him. "That wasn't a threat. That was friendly advice."

"It was a threat. And I do not tolerate threats against those under my protection." Cornelius stepped forward, placing himself directly between Mago and Zeph. He was small—barely cat-sized—but he drew himself up to his full height and let the hoard-guardian instinct blaze in his chest. "You may be a captain on your ship. But Zeph is *mine*. And I do not share."

The air between them crackled.

Not literally. Cornelius had no breath weapon he could safely use in close quarters, no magic that could stop an orc smuggler.

But he had *presence*. The primal, territorial fury of a dragon whose hoard had been threatened.

And Mago, to his credit, recognized it.

The orc tilted his head slightly, reevaluating. Then, slowly, he stepped aside.

"You're braver than you look, Curator."

"And you are exactly as dangerous as I expected." Cornelius kept his wings spread, his gaze locked on Mago. "We are leaving now. If you have further business with me, you may visit the library during normal operating hours."

"I'll keep that in mind."

Cornelius descended the gangplank with measured, deliberate steps. Zeph followed close behind, not speaking, not looking back.

They walked the length of the dock in silence.

Past the warehouses.

Past The Gilded Gull.

Past the market plaza.

Only when they reached the street leading back toward the library district did Zeph finally speak.

"He was gonna hurt me."

"Yes."

"And you stopped him."

"Yes."

Zeph was quiet for a moment. Then, quieter: "Thanks."

Cornelius's wings folded against his sides. The adrenaline was fading now, leaving behind a faint tremor in his claws and a hollow feeling in his chest.

He had just challenged an armed smuggler on his own ship.

With nothing but posture and pride.

Idiotic.

Reckless.

Necessary.

"You are my apprentice," Cornelius said. His voice was steady, even if his claws were not. "Threatening you is the same as threatening my hoard. I do not tolerate either."

Zeph grinned. It was shaky, but genuine. "I'm part of your hoard now?"

"Do not let it go to your head."

"Too late."

They walked in silence for another block. The noise and chaos of the docks faded behind them, replaced by the quieter sounds of the market district—vendors packing up their stalls, the distant clatter of cart wheels on cobblestones.

Finally, Cornelius said, "We have the motive."

"Debt," Zeph said. "Elias owed Mago a fortune. Needed to pay it off or get his knees broken. So he agreed to steal from the vault."

"Precisely. Which means Elias was not simply a courier caught in the wrong place. He was an active participant. Willing or coerced, he planned to rob the Kallistos vault and use the stolen correspondence to pay his debt."

"But he didn't finish the job."

"No. He died before he could deliver the stolen goods." Cornelius's tail curled. "Which raises the question: who killed him? And why?"

"Maybe Sophia found out he was planning to sell the letters to Mago instead of giving them to her."

"Possible. Or perhaps the theft went wrong and his co-conspirators eliminated him to cover their involvement." Cornelius adjusted his spectacles. "Either way, we now know *why* Elias was in the vault. Greed. Desperation. The same motives that have driven criminals since the beginning of recorded history."

"And Mago?"

"Mago is a smuggler and a lender of last resort. Unpleasant, yes. Dangerous, absolutely. But not our murderer." Cornelius glanced back toward the docks. "He wanted his money. Dead couriers do not pay debts."

"He's got fireworks, though. The restricted kind."

"I noticed."

"You think he sold the accelerant to whoever melted the vault?"

"It is plausible. But we have no proof. And after that encounter, I suspect Captain Mago will be far less cooperative if we attempt to question him further." Cornelius's wings twitched. "We will note the fireworks in the log and proceed with our existing leads."

"Sophia and Petros."

"Yes. The handkerchief. The blue thread. The connections we can prove." Cornelius turned down the street toward the library, his mind already moving ahead to the next steps. "Mago gave us the *why*. Now we need the *who* and the *how*."

Zeph nodded. He was still pale, but his steps were steadier now.

They walked the rest of the way in companionable silence.

And when the library finally came into view—its amber dome rising above the rooftops, solid and familiar and *safe*—Cornelius felt the tightness in his chest begin to ease.

Home.

His hoard.

Intact.

For now.
