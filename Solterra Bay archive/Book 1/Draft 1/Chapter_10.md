# Chapter 10

The Golden Amphora smelled of spilled ale and fried fish.

Cornelius stood in the doorway, wings folded tight against the press of bodies, and resisted the urge to turn around and leave immediately. The tavern was *loud*. Voices layered over voices in a cacophony of trading gossip and Feast business. Someone in the back corner was playing a badly tuned lyre. The floor was sticky.

This was the opposite of his sanctuary.

This was chaos given architectural form.

But Petros Kallistos was inside—Zeph had spotted him through the front window ten minutes ago—and Cornelius had not come this far to retreat simply because the venue was aesthetically offensive.

"You sure about this?" Zeph asked quietly. He was pressed against Cornelius's side, trying to look casual despite the way his eyes kept darting around the crowd. "I mean, accusing him in front of all these people?"

"I am always sure." Cornelius adjusted his spectacles and stepped into the tavern. "Public accountability makes denial impossible. Once I present the evidence, Petros will have no choice but to confess or be exposed as a liar in front of his peers."

"And if he just... lies anyway?"

"Then I will document his lies and add them to my report." Cornelius's tail swished with satisfaction. "But he will not. The evidence is too conclusive. He will recognize that resistance is futile and surrender to the inevitable."

Zeph did not look convinced, but he followed anyway.

The crowd parted reluctantly as Cornelius moved through it. People glanced down, did double-takes at the small dragon navigating between their legs, and shuffled aside with varying degrees of grace. A few muttered greetings. Most simply stared.

Cornelius ignored them all.

His focus was on the corner table where Petros Kallistos sat slumped over a cup of wine, looking exactly as miserable as a man who had betrayed his own family vault deserved to look.

Perfect.

Cornelius crossed the final stretch of sticky floor and stopped directly in front of Petros's table.

"Petros Kallistos," he said. His voice cut through the ambient noise with the precision of a carefully thrown knife. "We need to speak."

Petros looked up slowly. His eyes were red-rimmed and unfocused. Wine stained the front of his tunic. He blinked at Cornelius with the confusion of someone who could not quite remember how he had ended up in a tavern at ten in the morning.

"Dragon," Petros said. His voice was thick. Slurred. "Library dragon. What're you doing here?"

"I am here because you committed a crime." Cornelius's wings flared slightly. "And I have proof."

The conversations around them began to quiet.

People were listening now. Turning toward the corner table. Setting down their cups and leaning in to hear what the dragon was saying to one of the Kallistos scions.

Excellent.

An audience made this better. More official. More *final*.

Cornelius reached into his inner pocket and pulled out the folded parchment—the note he had found tucked in Petros's tax records. He set it on the table with deliberate precision, smoothing the creases so the text was clearly visible.

"Do you recognize this?" Cornelius asked.

Petros stared at the parchment. His bloodshot eyes moved slowly across the words. Then he looked back at Cornelius with an expression that might have been confusion or guilt or simply exhaustion.

"Where did you get that?"

"From your files. In the library archive." Cornelius tapped the parchment with one claw. "Your handwriting. Your vault code. Instructions to burn the note. Written for your co-conspirators."

Petros's face went pale.

The tavern had gone almost silent now. Even the badly tuned lyre had stopped.

Cornelius felt a surge of vindication. This was it. The moment when the careful documentation and logical deduction paid off. When the criminal realized he had been caught by someone smarter, more thorough, more *competent* than the investigators who had dismissed the case as natural causes.

"You gave the vault code to Sophia Doukas," Cornelius continued. His voice was steady. Certain. "You arranged for Elias of Tyre to deliver a package containing the tools necessary to breach the vault wards. You conspired to steal your own family's correspondence—probably to sell it or use it for blackmail. And when Elias failed to complete the theft properly, you poisoned him to eliminate the witness."

Someone in the crowd gasped.

Petros just stared at him.

"You were found drunk in the archives with a ventilation schematic in your lap," Cornelius said. "You admitted to discussing the vault with a stranger at a tavern. Your handwriting matches the intake form Elias signed. And this note—" He tapped the parchment again, "—proves you provided the access code to your co-conspirators. The evidence is conclusive. You are guilty."

The silence stretched.

Petros looked at the note. At Cornelius. At the crowd of people watching with wide eyes and open mouths.

Then he started laughing.

It was not the laugh of a man caught and trying to bluster his way out.

It was the laugh of someone so exhausted and broken that the absurdity of the accusation had pushed him past anger into something darker.

"You think I killed Elias," Petros said. His voice was ragged. Bitter. "You think I robbed my own vault."

"The evidence—"

"The evidence is shit." Petros pushed the parchment back across the table. "Yeah, I wrote that note. Elias asked me to. Three weeks ago. Said he needed the code to check on a package his client was sending. Said it was important. Time-sensitive. I was drunk. I wrote it down for him." He laughed again, sharper this time. "Told him to burn it after. Guess he didn't."

Cornelius's tail stilled. "That is a convenient excuse—"

"It's the *truth*." Petros leaned forward, elbows on the table, wine-cup forgotten. "You want to know where I was the night Elias died? I was in the Watch drunk tank. Got hauled in for pissing in the Council fountain at sunset. Spent the whole night in a cell. Didn't get released until after sunrise."

The world tilted.

Cornelius's claws flexed against the table edge. "You are lying."

"Ask Captain Melas. Ask any of the Watch guards. They had me locked up from dusk to dawn." Petros's expression was hollow. Defeated. "I didn't kill anyone. I didn't steal anything. I'm just a drunk idiot who trusted the wrong courier and wrote down my vault code because I was too plastered to think straight."

No.

No, that could not be correct.

The evidence pointed to Petros. The note. The handwriting. The schematic. The tavern confession.

It all *fit*.

"The ventilation map," Cornelius said. His voice sounded strange in his own ears. Tight. "You had it in your possession. You gave the maintenance schedule to—"

"I woke up with it." Petros rubbed his face. "Don't know how it got there. Don't remember anything after the fourth cup of wine at the Laughing Gull. I sure as hell didn't plan a robbery. I can barely plan my own breakfast."

Someone in the crowd snickered.

Cornelius's wings trembled.

The alibi was ironclad. If Petros had been in the Watch drunk tank during the theft and murder, he could not have physically committed the crime. Could not have opened the vault. Could not have poisoned Elias.

Which meant—

Which meant the entire theory was wrong.

Petros had not conspired with Sophia.

Petros had been *used*.

Tricked into writing the vault code by Elias weeks before the theft. Plied with alcohol and manipulated into discussing the wards at a tavern. Planted with a ventilation schematic while unconscious.

Elias had not been the expendable courier.

Elias had been the *planner*.

And Cornelius had missed it entirely.

"You accused me of murder," Petros said quietly. His voice was flat now. Empty. "In front of half the merchant district. Based on a note I wrote when I was drunk and a map I don't even remember seeing."

Cornelius opened his mouth. Closed it.

The documentation had been perfect. The logical chain had been sound. Every piece of evidence had pointed to Petros as the insider, the access point, the weak link.

But the conclusion had been *wrong*.

"I..." Cornelius's tail coiled tight. "I was following the evidence."

"You were following your own assumptions." Petros picked up his wine cup and drained it in one long swallow. "You decided I was guilty and found evidence to match. That's not investigation. That's... I don't even know what that is."

The crowd was murmuring now. Voices rising in agreement. Someone near the bar said something about "foreign dragon" and "Kallistos honor." Someone else muttered about "accusations" and "proof."

The mood was shifting.

Cornelius felt it like a physical change in the air. The curiosity and shock that had followed his accusation was curdling into something uglier.

Anger.

Directed at him.

"You should leave," Petros said. He was not looking at Cornelius anymore. Just staring into his empty cup. "Before someone decides you've insulted the family badly enough to do something about it."

"I was attempting to solve a murder—"

"You were showing off." Petros's voice was bitter. "Playing detective. Trying to prove you're smarter than the Watch. And you picked the easiest target. The drunk. The failure. The embarrassment to House Kallistos." He finally looked up, and his eyes were hard. Cold. "Well, congratulations. You embarrassed yourself instead."

The murmuring grew louder.

Someone near the door stood up. A broad-shouldered man wearing Kallistos house colors. His expression was not friendly.

Zeph's hand closed around Cornelius's wing. "We should go. Like, right now."

Cornelius could not move.

His mind was racing, trying to salvage the theory, trying to find a way the evidence could still point to Petros despite the alibi, but every angle led back to the same conclusion.

He had been wrong.

Catastrophically, publicly wrong.

"Cornelius." Zeph's voice was urgent now. "They're getting up."

More people were standing. Moving toward the corner table. Their faces angry. Protective of the Kallistos name and the drunk scion who had just been humiliated by an outsider.

By a dragon who ran a library and thought he could play investigator.

Cornelius's wings snapped open.

The sudden movement startled the nearest people back half a step—just enough space for Cornelius to turn and bolt toward the door.

Zeph was right behind him.

They hit the street at a run, Cornelius's claws scrabbling on cobblestones, Zeph's longer legs eating distance in awkward, gangly strides.

Behind them, the tavern door slammed open.

Voices shouted. Angry. Insulted.

But Cornelius did not look back.

He ran.

Down one street. Around a corner. Through an alley that smelled of fish and brine. Another turn. Another street.

Only when they had put three full blocks between themselves and the Golden Amphora did Cornelius finally stop, wings heaving, claws aching from the sprint across rough stone.

Zeph collapsed against a wall, breathing hard. "Holy shit. Holy *shit*. I thought they were gonna throw bottles at us."

Cornelius said nothing.

He stood in the middle of the empty street, trembling, the weight of his failure pressing down like a physical thing.

The evidence had been real. The handwriting match. The vault code. The schematic.

But the conclusion had been wrong.

He had built a perfect logical structure on a foundation of incorrect assumptions.

And he had presented it publicly. With absolute certainty. With *smugness*.

In front of witnesses.

Including the man he had falsely accused.

"So, uh." Zeph straightened, still breathing hard. "What now?"

Cornelius could not answer.

Because he did not know.

The case was not solved. Petros was not the killer. The evidence that had seemed so conclusive was just... fragments. Pieces of a puzzle he had assembled incorrectly.

And now he had no theory at all.

Just a library he could not access, a murderer still free, and the certainty that half the merchant district would be talking about the foreign dragon who had accused a Kallistos scion of murder based on a drunk's scribbled note.

His wings folded tight.

His tail coiled around his hindclaws.

And for the first time since the investigation began, Cornelius Drake did not know what to do next.

"He was in jail," Cornelius said finally. His voice was quiet. Hollow. "The entire time. He could not have committed the crime."

"Yeah." Zeph shifted his weight. "I heard."

"Which means Elias planned the theft himself. Manipulated Petros into providing the code. Used him as a source of information and access without Petros even realizing he was being used."

"Sounds like it."

"Which means my entire reconstruction of events was fundamentally flawed." Cornelius's claws scraped against stone. "I followed the evidence to the wrong conclusion. Mistook the tool for the actor. Accused an innocent man of murder."

Zeph did not argue.

The silence stretched between them.

Cornelius had been so *certain*. So convinced that his intellectual rigor and careful documentation had cut through the Watch's incompetence to find the truth.

But he had been wrong.

And everyone knew it.

"We should..." Zeph trailed off. "I mean, maybe we go back to the library? Check if Theo's lifted the closure yet? We could—"

"No." Cornelius's voice was flat. "The library is still sealed. I am still banned. And I have just demonstrated precisely why Captain Melas was correct to exclude me from the investigation."

"That's not—"

"I humiliated myself. Publicly. In front of witnesses who will ensure the story spreads through every tavern and trading house in the city." Cornelius turned away from Zeph, unable to meet his eyes. "I proved that I am exactly what Theo said I was. A dragon who runs a library. Not an investigator. Not a detective. Just a Curator who overestimated his own competence."

"You were trying to solve a murder—"

"I was trying to prove I was clever." The admission tasted bitter. "And I failed."

The Spring Feast crowds moved past them on the main street, oblivious to the small dragon and his apprentice standing frozen in the alley.

Cornelius's mind replayed the scene in the tavern. Petros's hollow laugh. The crowd's shifting anger. The way his perfect theory had disintegrated under a single piece of contradictory evidence.

He had been so sure.

And he had been so wrong.

"What do we do now?" Zeph asked quietly.

Cornelius folded his wings tighter.

"I do not know," he said.

And it was the truest thing he had said all morning.
