# Chapter 17

The silence pressed down like a physical weight.

Cornelius perched atop the bronze Intake bin, wings folded tight against his sides, tail coiled beneath him. The Shadow Zone lived up to its name. Lamplight from the distant dome entrance reached this far corner only as a faint suggestion. Enough to outline shapes. Not enough to reveal details.

Perfect for an ambush.

His claws gripped the cold metal. The hoard-sense prickle was constant now. Insistent. The stolen correspondence was directly beneath him, hidden inside the locked bin. So close he could almost taste the wrongness of it. Decades of letters that belonged in the Kallistos vault, not stuffed into an obsolete collection mechanism.

His throat ached. The bruises from Alexandros's grip had settled into a persistent, tender throb. A reminder of exactly how easily the man could hurt him.

Could *kill* him.

Cornelius's wings trembled slightly. He forced them still.

Across the reading floor, hidden behind the heavy wooden circulation desk, Zeph waited. Cornelius could not see the boy from this angle. But he knew Zeph was there. Crouched low. One hand on the nearest ladder release. The other clutching the emergency whistle.

Ready.

They had been waiting for—Cornelius's internal clock estimated—forty-three minutes.

Forty-three minutes of silence broken only by distant sounds. The fading revelry of the Spring Feast. The occasional call of the Watch patrol passing outside. The settling creaks of old wood and stone.

Forty-three minutes to think about everything that could go wrong.

Cornelius's claws flexed against the bronze.

The trap was set. The floor waxed. The ladders staged. The plan rehearsed.

But plans relied on predictability. On opponents following expected patterns.

Alexandros Doukas had already proven himself adaptable. Dangerous. Willing to kill to protect his interests.

What if he brought weapons this time? What if he entered through a different route? What if—

A faint scraping sound.

Cornelius went utterly still. His acute hearing focused.

There.

From behind the circulation desk. Not from the southern archive corridor where Alexandros had entered before.

From Zeph's hiding spot.

Cornelius's tail twitched. Concern spiked through him.

Then a whisper. Barely audible. Carefully pitched to reach Cornelius without carrying across the dome.

"Cornelius?"

Zeph's voice. Strained. Nervous.

Cornelius hesitated. Breaking silence was a risk. But the boy would not speak without reason.

"What?" Cornelius whispered back. His voice was rougher than intended. Throat still sore.

A pause. Then, quieter still:

"How much longer do you think?"

Cornelius's claws tapped once against the bronze. A thinking gesture that produced no meaningful sound.

"I do not know," he admitted. "Alexandros must wait for the Watch patrol to clear this section. The rotation schedule suggests another—" He stopped. Calculated. "—seventeen minutes before the eastern perimeter is unmonitored."

"Seventeen minutes." Zeph's whisper carried a note of something that might have been amusement or despair. Hard to tell. "Okay. I can do seventeen minutes."

Another pause.

Then:

"I am really bad at waiting."

Despite everything—the fear, the tension, the very real possibility of imminent violence—Cornelius felt his maw twitch.

Almost a smile.

"I have noticed," he whispered.

Silence returned. But it felt different now. Less oppressive. The acknowledgment of shared discomfort had eased something.

Cornelius shifted his weight slightly. The bronze beneath him was cold enough that it had started to leech warmth even through his scales. He ignored the discomfort. Focused instead on listening.

The library's acoustics were excellent. A necessary feature for a space designed around silence and study. Sound carried. Echoed. Every whisper, every footstep, every scrape of chair against stone reverberated through the dome with crystalline clarity.

Which meant Alexandros would be audible long before he became visible.

Assuming he entered through the ventilation system again.

Assuming he came alone.

Assuming—

Cornelius cut off that line of thinking. Assumptions had led him astray before. Had resulted in publicly accusing an innocent man. Had nearly derailed the entire investigation.

He would observe. Document. React to what *was*, not what he feared might be.

Another whisper from the circulation desk.

"Cornelius?"

"Yes?"

"Can I ask you something?"

Cornelius's tail coiled tighter. This felt less like a tactical question and more like the kind of conversation Zeph initiated when he was trying to distract himself.

But they had time. Seventeen minutes, give or take.

"You may ask."

"Why did you become a Curator?"

The question caught Cornelius off guard. His claws went still against the bronze.

"I am a library dragon," he said slowly. "It is... what I am. What I was born to be."

"But you chose *this* library. Right? You could have gone anywhere. Could have started a new collection somewhere else." A pause. "Why Solterra Bay?"

Cornelius considered this.

The truth was complicated. Layered. Involved memories of a younger self who had been drawn to the ancient stone building the way dragons of other species were drawn to gold or jewels.

"The library needed a Curator," he said finally. "And I needed a hoard."

"That is not really an answer."

"It is the only answer I have."

More silence.

Then Zeph said, very quietly:

"I am glad you picked here. I mean. If you had not. I would not have..." The boy trailed off. Started again. "This has been terrifying. And I am pretty sure I am going to have nightmares about waxed floors for the rest of my life. But I am also glad I got to help. To be part of... this."

Something warm and unexpected unfurled in Cornelius's chest.

He had spent fifteen years maintaining careful distance from the humans who used his library. Had referred to them by title and function rather than name. Had treated Zeph himself as an inconvenient but necessary assistant.

But the boy waiting in the dark behind the circulation desk was not an assistant.

He was a partner.

A friend.

Someone who had climbed into a sealed building to help set a trap for a murderer despite being terrified. Who had stayed when offered an easy exit. Who had asked to be trusted as an equal.

Cornelius's wings rustled.

"You break the pattern," he whispered.

"What?"

"Most people I have known treat this library as a resource. A tool. They value it for what it provides but have no investment in its integrity." Cornelius's claws flexed. "You are different. You care about the library itself. About maintaining its sanctity."

"I mean. Yeah. Of course I do. It is—" Zeph's whisper caught slightly. "It is important. What we protect here. What we preserve."

"Yes."

"And you are important too. Like. Not just the library. You." The words came faster now. Tumbling out as if Zeph had been holding them back and the darkness finally gave him the courage to speak. "You are the most annoying person I have ever met. You criticize my handwriting and you gave me a lecture about pastry crumbs that lasted twenty minutes. But you are also the smartest person I know. And when Alexandros grabbed you in that alley I was so angry I could not think straight."

Cornelius went very still.

"You were angry?"

"Of course I was angry. He hurt you. He *threatened* you. And I just—" Zeph's whisper turned fierce. "No one gets to do that. Not to you. Not in our library."

*Our library.*

The phrase settled into Cornelius's chest beside the warmth that had already taken root there.

He had spent so long thinking of the library as *his*. His hoard. His sanctuary. His responsibility alone.

But it was not alone anymore.

Had not been for a while, if he was honest.

"Thank you," Cornelius whispered. His voice came out rougher than intended. "For staying. For helping. For being—" He paused. Searched for the right word. "—loyal."

"You are welcome."

The silence that followed was comfortable. Shared.

Cornelius turned his attention back to listening. The Watch patrol had passed the eastern wall seven minutes ago. Which meant another ten minutes before—

A sound.

New. Different.

Not footsteps or voices.

A faint hissing. Like water on hot metal.

Cornelius's entire body went rigid. His wings flared slightly. Instinct demanding he make himself larger.

The smell hit him half a second later.

Burnt almond. Ozone.

The exact chemical signature he had documented at the melted vault seal.

The exact signature he had smelled on Alexandros Doukas's hands in the alley.

Kiln accelerant. Magical catalyst.

Someone was using alchemical fire to melt a lock.

Cornelius's mind raced. The main doors were still barred from the outside. The ventilation grate in the southern archive was the route Alexandros had used before.

But the service entrance—the staff door that opened onto the narrow alley behind the eastern wall—had a lock.

A lock that could be melted.

The hissing continued. Faint. Distant. Coming from beyond the archives.

Then it stopped.

Silence returned.

But it was a different kind of silence now. Tense. Waiting.

Cornelius's claws dug into the bronze bin.

Alexandros was inside the building.

A faint scrape. Boot leather on stone. Careful. Controlled.

Getting closer.

Cornelius did not move. Did not breathe.

His vision had adjusted to the darkness. He could make out shapes now. The circulation desk. The reading tables. The waxed aisle that looked perfectly normal in shadow.

A figure emerged from the southern archive corridor.

Tall. Moving with deliberate caution.

Alexandros.

He paused at the edge of the main floor. Scanning. His head turned slowly. Taking in the empty dome. The staged ladders that looked—from his vantage point—like they had simply been left in their working positions during normal operations.

Cornelius held perfectly still. His bronze scales blended with the bronze bin. His small size an advantage. Invisible in the Shadow Zone's darkness.

Alexandros took a step forward.

His boot hit the waxed stone.

For a moment nothing happened.

Then his weight shifted and the boot slid.

Just slightly. Just enough to break his stride.

He caught himself. Steadied.

Looked down.

Cornelius's heart hammered against his ribs.

Alexandros crouched. Touched the floor with bare fingers. Rubbed them together.

Stood.

His expression—what little Cornelius could see from this distance in the darkness—shifted.

Calculation. Realization.

He knew.

Alexandros straightened. Did not call out. Did not acknowledge the trap openly.

Instead he moved forward with even more caution. Each step placed carefully. Testing the stone before committing his weight.

Crossing the waxed aisle slowly. Deliberately.

Avoiding the obvious hazard.

Cornelius's wings trembled.

The man was too careful. Too controlled.

This was not going according to plan.

Alexandros reached the far side of the waxed section. His boots found dry stone. He paused again. Scanned the dome.

His gaze swept across the circulation desk.

Across the Shadow Zone.

Across the exact spot where Cornelius perched atop the locked Intake bin.

Cornelius did not move. Did not even blink.

Alexandros's eyes slid past him. Seeing the bin. Seeing the bronze fixture.

Not seeing the small dragon whose scales matched the metal too perfectly.

Satisfied, Alexandros approached.

Head on. No hesitation now.

Directly toward the Intake bin.

Directly toward Cornelius.

Ten feet away.

Eight.

Six.

Cornelius could see details now. The dark clothes. The bare hands—no gloves tonight. The faint chemical stains on Alexandros's fingers.

Four feet.

Alexandros reached the bin. Stopped directly in front of it.

Directly below where Cornelius crouched frozen atop the bronze lid.

Alexandros pulled something from his coat pocket. A thin metal tool. Lockpicks.

He crouched. Fitted the pick into the bin's simple lock.

Worked it with practiced efficiency.

The lock clicked.

Released.

Alexandros pocketed the picks. Gripped the bin's hinged lid.

Lifted.

The lid swung up on old hinges. A faint creak.

Alexandros leaned forward. Peered inside.

Reached in.

His hand emerged holding a bundle. Oilcloth wrapped around something rectangular. Tied with ribbon gone brittle with age.

Forty years of Kallistos correspondence.

Proof of the vault theft.

Evidence of motive for murder.

Alexandros held the bundle. Examined it. Confirmed its contents.

Then straightened. Tucked the oilcloth package under one arm.

Turned toward the southern archive corridor.

Toward escape.

Cornelius moved.

Not toward Alexandros. He could not fight the man directly. Could not stop him through physical force.

But he could stop him from leaving with the evidence.

Cornelius launched himself upward. Wings spread. Claws extended.

Not at Alexandros.

At the air.

His wings caught. Lifted him.

Three feet. Five. Eight.

High enough.

"NOW!" Cornelius shouted. His voice echoed through the dome. Shattered the silence like breaking glass.

Behind the circulation desk, Zeph moved.
