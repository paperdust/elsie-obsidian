# Chapter 13

The walk back from the market square took Cornelius past the public baths.

He had not intended to go this route. The direct path to his rented room led through the merchant quarter, not the bath district. But the merchant quarter meant crowds. Meant vendors who might recognize him from the Golden Amphora incident. Meant the possibility of encountering Petros Kallistos or his house guards or simply more people who would see a small dragon walking alone and remember his very public failure.

So Cornelius had taken the long way. The quiet way.

The side streets near the baths were nearly empty. Most citizens were still at the Feast. The few who were not had retreated indoors for evening meals or early rest. The stone beneath Cornelius's claws was smooth here. Old. Worn down by centuries of foot traffic leading to and from the bath complex.

He moved carefully, tail lifted to avoid dragging across the uneven surfaces.

The alley between the bath's south wall and a row of shuttered shops was darker than he had expected. The buildings blocked most of the ambient light from the market district. Only a single oil lamp flickered near the bath entrance, casting long shadows that shifted with each gust of wind from the harbor.

Cornelius paused at the alley's mouth.

His scales prickled.

Not the deep, instinctual *hoard-threat* warning he had felt at the vault. Something different. Smaller. The physical sensation of being watched.

He scanned the alley. Empty. Just stone walls and closed doors and the faint steam rising from the bath's ventilation grates.

Paranoia. He was being paranoid.

A natural reaction after the humiliation at the Golden Amphora. After the argument with Zeph. After spending hours alone in his room, cataloging evidence and building theories with no one to check his work or point out the flaws in his reasoning.

He was jumpy. Anxious. Seeing threats where none existed.

Cornelius forced himself forward into the alley.

His claws clicked against stone. The sound echoed off the walls. Too loud. Too obvious.

He was halfway through when the figure stepped out from the recessed doorway.

Cornelius froze.

The man was tall. Well-dressed. Dark hair pulled back from a face that was handsome in the sharp, careful way of someone who had never lacked for wealth or status.

Alexandros Doukas.

"Curator Drake." The voice was smooth. Pleasant. "Walking alone this evening?"

Cornelius's wings pressed tight against his back. His mind raced through options. The alley was narrow. Stone walls on both sides. The only exits were behind him—back toward the market square—or ahead, past Alexandros, toward the residential quarter.

"Alexandros." Cornelius kept his voice level. Professional. "I was not aware we had an appointment."

"We do not." Alexandros moved forward two steps. Not aggressive. Just... present. Filling the space. "I simply happened to see you pass and thought we might have a brief conversation."

"About?"

"Your investigation."

The word hung in the air between them.

Cornelius's claws flexed against stone. "I am not conducting an investigation. The Watch has jurisdiction over Elias of Tyre's death and the vault theft. I have cooperated fully with their inquiries."

"Have you?" Alexandros tilted his head slightly. The gesture was curious. Almost friendly. "Because I have heard otherwise. I have heard you have been asking questions. Making inquiries. Approaching members of prominent families with rather pointed accusations."

Petros. He meant the scene at the Golden Amphora.

Or Eudora. Who had probably spoken to someone after their market square confrontation.

Or Sophia, who had certainly told her family about Cornelius's visit to the Doukas estate.

"I am attempting to recover stolen property from my library," Cornelius said carefully. "That is within my authority as Curator."

"Your *sealed* library." Alexandros's smile did not reach his eyes. "The one Captain Melas has declared a crime scene. The one you are legally barred from entering."

"Temporarily."

"Ah. Temporarily." Alexandros took another step forward.

Cornelius became acutely aware of the size differential.

Alexandros was not a large man by human standards. Average height. Lean build. But he was still a *man*. Adult. Fully grown.

And Cornelius was a dragon the size of a house cat.

Twelve pounds of scales and wings and claws that were sharp enough to draw blood but not strong enough to stop a determined human from simply picking him up and snapping his neck.

The realization sent a cold spike of fear through his chest.

"I think we both know," Alexandros continued, "that you are not simply waiting for the Watch to conclude their work. You are pursuing your own theories. Building your own case. Playing detective."

Eudora's words. Almost exactly.

*You are attempting to salvage your pride.*

Cornelius's tail coiled tighter. "I am ensuring that the library's security has not been compromised. That is my responsibility."

"Your responsibility is to catalog books." Alexandros's voice was still pleasant. Still calm. "Not to harass merchants. Not to interrogate members of established houses. Not to make wild accusations about theft and murder based on circumstantial evidence and your own overinflated sense of intellectual superiority."

The words hit like physical blows.

Cornelius forced himself not to step backward. Not to show weakness.

"If you have concerns about my conduct," he said stiffly, "I suggest you bring them to the Curator's Guild or the Council. I answer to both."

"Do you?" Alexandros moved again. Closer. "Because from where I stand, you answer to no one. You are a foreign dragon with a Guild charter who has been given entirely too much autonomy and entirely too much undeserved respect."

*Foreign dragon.*

The phrase echoed the mutters from the Golden Amphora. The dismissive glances from merchants who saw him as an outsider. An interloper. Someone who did not truly belong in Solterra Bay despite his years of service to the library.

"The Charter grants me—"

"The Charter grants you custodial authority over a civic institution. It does not grant you investigative powers. It does not make you an agent of the law." Alexandros stopped less than two body-lengths away. "And it certainly does not give you the right to interfere in family business."

Cornelius's scales prickled again. Harder now.

The hoard-threat instinct was screaming at him. Not because his books were in danger. Because *he* was in danger.

"I have interfered in nothing," Cornelius said. His voice came out steadier than he felt. "I have asked questions relevant to a crime committed in my library. That is all."

"You have made yourself a nuisance." Alexandros's pleasant expression did not change. "And nuisances have a way of experiencing unfortunate accidents. Especially during the Feast when the city is crowded and the Watch is stretched thin."

The threat was delivered in the same calm, conversational tone Alexandros might use to discuss the weather or the price of tiles.

Cornelius's wings flared involuntarily. A defensive posture. Instinctive. Useless against someone Alexandros's size.

"Are you threatening me?" Cornelius asked.

"I am offering friendly advice." Alexandros spread his hands. The gesture was open. Unthreatening. "You are a valued member of the community, Curator Drake. It would be terrible if something happened to you. A fall from a high shelf, perhaps. Or an unfortunate encounter with a drunk sailor in a dark alley. These things happen during festivals. Chaos breeds accidents."

Cornelius's mind catalogued the words. The phrasing. The specificity.

*A fall from a high shelf.*

The library. His sanctuary. Alexandros was implying access. Implying the ability to reach Cornelius even in the place he should be safest.

*An unfortunate encounter with a drunk sailor in a dark alley.*

This alley. This moment. A demonstration that Cornelius was vulnerable outside the library's wards.

"I have no intention of abandoning my inquiry," Cornelius said. His claws scraped against stone. "Elias of Tyre was murdered in my library. The Kallistos vault was breached. I will not allow those violations to go unanswered simply because you find my questions inconvenient."

Alexandros's expression shifted. The pleasant mask dropped for just a moment. What remained was cold. Calculating.

Dangerous.

"Then you are a fool," he said quietly.

He moved.

Not a strike. Not violence.

Just a single step forward and a hand that shot out and closed around Cornelius's neck.

The grip was not tight enough to choke. Not painful.

Just *there*. Controlling. Demonstrating exactly how easy it would be to squeeze.

Cornelius went absolutely still.

Every instinct screamed at him to fight. To claw. To bite. To do *something*.

But he was twelve pounds. And Alexandros could crush his windpipe with a casual flex of fingers.

"Drop this," Alexandros said. His face was very close now. Close enough that Cornelius could see the flecks of amber in his dark eyes. "Walk away. Go back to your books and your cataloging and your comfortable little existence. Forget about Elias. Forget about the vault. Forget you ever thought to play investigator."

Cornelius could not speak. Could barely breathe around the pressure on his throat.

But he could smell.

And Alexandros smelled *wrong*.

Not the turpentine and clay dust Cornelius associated with the Doukas workshop.

Something else. Faint but unmistakable.

Ozone.

Sharp and acrid, like the air before a lightning storm.

The same scent that had filled the library vault the morning after the breach.

And beneath it, barely perceptible but present: burnt almond.

Not cyanide. Not poison.

The smell of high-heat alchemical accelerants. Kiln compounds. The specific chemical signature of the reagents used to melt metal at temperatures far beyond what normal fire could achieve.

The exact scent Cornelius had catalogued in his notes from the vault door.

The vault seal had been melted with alchemical fire. Someone had used kiln accelerants—compounds that smelled of burnt almond when burned—combined with a magical catalyst that left the sharp tang of ozone.

And Alexandros Doukas smelled of both.

The realization cut through Cornelius's fear like a blade.

Alexandros had not just hired someone to breach the vault.

He had *been there*. Had wielded the accelerant himself. Had burned through the iron seal with his own hands.

That was why he had worn the heavy leather gloves in the alley days ago. To hide the burns. The stains. The residue that would mark him as someone who worked with dangerous chemicals and high magic.

"I see you understand," Alexandros said softly.

He had noticed Cornelius's nostrils flaring. Had seen the moment of recognition.

"You cannot—" Cornelius's voice was strangled. Weak.

"I can." Alexandros's grip tightened fractionally. Just enough to make breathing difficult. "And I will. If you do not walk away right now, you will join Elias as another unfortunate casualty of the Spring Feast. A small dragon, found dead in an alley. Perhaps crushed by falling debris. Perhaps poisoned by contaminated fish from a market stall. Tragic. But these things happen."

Cornelius's vision was starting to blur at the edges.

He tried to speak. To protest. To do *anything*.

But his body would not respond. He was frozen. Prey in the grip of a predator.

"Servants are replaceable," Alexandros continued. His voice was almost gentle now. "Couriers. Interns. Librarians. The city will mourn you for a week. Then they will appoint a new Curator and life will continue. No one will remember the foreign dragon who thought he could challenge his betters."

The pressure released.

Cornelius staggered backward, gasping. His wings scraped against the stone wall. His claws scrabbled for purchase on the uneven ground.

Alexandros straightened his sleeve. Adjusted his collar. The pleasant mask returned as if it had never left.

"Good evening, Curator Drake," he said. "I trust we will not need to have this conversation again."

He turned and walked away.

Not hurrying. Not looking back.

Just striding calmly out of the alley toward the residential quarter as if he had done nothing more threatening than discuss the weather.

Cornelius stood frozen against the wall.

His throat ached. His scales felt too tight across his chest. His wings trembled with adrenaline and unspent fear.

He had been *so stupid*.

Walking alone through empty streets. Focused on his pride and his theories and his desperate need to prove himself competent. Not thinking about physical safety. Not considering that the person who had killed Elias might view Cornelius as an equal threat.

He had thought being small made him insignificant.

Instead it made him *easy*.

Cornelius's legs shook as he forced himself to move. One step. Then another. Toward the far end of the alley. Away from where Alexandros had disappeared.

He needed to get somewhere safe. Somewhere public. Somewhere with witnesses and light and people who would notice if a small dragon was attacked.

He needed—

He needed *Zeph*.

The thought arrived with brutal clarity.

Zeph, who had been watching his back for days. Who had spotted threats Cornelius missed. Who could move through crowds and talk to people and provide the kind of backup that made a twelve-pound dragon feel less like prey and more like an investigator.

Zeph, whom Cornelius had driven away with his obsessive focus and dismissive arrogance.

Zeph, who was currently at the Feast market, laughing with friends, finally free of Cornelius's relentless demands.

Cornelius reached the end of the alley and stumbled out into a wider street. Oil lamps flickered in wall sconces. A few people walked past, heading toward evening destinations. None of them looked at the small dragon pressed against the corner of a building, trying to catch his breath.

He was alone.

Truly, completely alone.

And Alexandros Doukas—the man who had killed Elias, who had breached the vault, who had stolen the Kallistos correspondence and probably sold it for profit or leverage—had just threatened to kill him.

Not someday. Not eventually.

*Soon*.

If Cornelius did not stop investigating.

If he did not walk away and pretend he had learned nothing.

If he did not abandon his library and his hoard and his responsibility to the sanctuary that had been violated.

Cornelius's claws scraped against stone.

He thought of the vault. The melted seal. The stolen documents. Elias's body crumpled on the floor.

He thought of Alexandros's calm, pleasant voice delivering death threats as casually as weather predictions.

He thought of Zeph's face during their argument. The hurt and anger and frustration.

*You're doing it again. Acting like you're the only one who cares about solving this.*

Cornelius had been wrong about Petros. Wrong about Sophia. Wrong about so many connections and assumptions.

But he was not wrong about this.

Alexandros Doukas had killed Elias of Tyre.

And if Cornelius walked away now, Alexandros would never face consequences.

Would continue moving through the city. Wealthy. Respected. Untouchable.

While Elias's body moldered in whatever unmarked grave the city provided for debtors and criminals.

While the library remained sealed and violated and unsafe.

While Cornelius lived with the knowledge that he had been threatened into silence by someone who treated murder as a minor inconvenience.

His wings stopped trembling.

His breathing steadied.

The fear was still there. Cold and sharp in his chest.

But beneath it, something else was building.

*Anger*.

Cornelius pushed away from the wall and started walking.

Not toward his rented room. Not toward the library.

Toward the market square.

Where the Feast continued. Where Zeph was probably still enjoying music and fried dough and the company of people who did not treat every interaction as part of an obsessive investigation.

Cornelius owed him an apology.

A real one. Not qualified by pride or delayed until after he had made progress.

And then—assuming Zeph was willing to forgive him—they needed to talk.

Because Cornelius now knew exactly who had killed Elias.

And he had the scent evidence to prove it.

But solving a murder was very different from surviving the murderer long enough to present that proof to someone with actual authority.

For that, he needed help.

He needed his apprentice.

He needed his *friend*.

Cornelius's claws clicked steadily against the cobblestones as he walked toward the distant sound of drums and lyres and celebration.

His throat still ached where Alexandros had gripped it.

But his mind was already cataloging. Organizing. Planning the conversation he would have with Zeph. The apology he owed. The evidence he had gathered.

The case he would build.

Not alone.

Not anymore.
