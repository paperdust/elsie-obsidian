# Chapter 18

Behind the circulation desk, Zeph moved.

The boy's hand shot to the ladder release. Found the knot Cornelius had tied. The simple slip-knot designed to come apart with one hard pull.

Zeph yanked.

The rope went slack.

The ladder—twenty feet of brass and wood staged at a precise angle on the Index rail—swung down like a pendulum.

Fast.

The momentum built as it arced across the dome. The brass wheels screamed against the rail. The sound was enormous. Deafening in the library's perfect acoustics.

Alexandros spun toward the noise.

The ladder slammed across the opening to the southern archive corridor.

A barricade. Blocking his escape route.

Cornelius dropped.

His wings snapped open. Caught air. Controlled his descent from the high rafters where he had launched himself.

He landed on a reading table. Claws scraping against polished wood. Wings spread wide. Every scale standing on end.

Between Alexandros and the main doors.

Between the murderer and freedom.

Alexandros's gaze locked onto him.

The man's expression was cold. Flat. The genial mask he wore in public had vanished entirely.

"Curator," Alexandros said. His voice was calm. Conversational. As if they were discussing book loans instead of standing in a darkened library after he had just stolen evidence from a crime scene. "That was clever. But ultimately pointless."

He still held the oilcloth bundle under one arm. Forty years of Kallistos correspondence. Proof of motive. Proof of theft.

Not his anymore.

"The letters stay here," Cornelius said. His voice was steady. Clear. The tone he used when enforcing library rules. "You will surrender them and wait for the Watch."

Alexandros smiled.

It did not reach his eyes.

"No," he said.

He moved.

Not toward the barricaded corridor. Not toward the main doors where Cornelius blocked his path.

Toward the waxed aisle.

Directly at Cornelius.

Alexandros's first step hit the treated stone. His boot slid. He had crossed this section before with careful, measured steps.

This time he was running.

His weight shifted wrong. The slick surface pulled his feet out from under him.

He went down hard.

Slammed shoulder-first into the floor. The oilcloth bundle skidded from his grip. Slid across the waxed stone.

Stopped three feet from Cornelius's table.

Cornelius's wings flared.

He could reach it. Could grab the letters. Could—

Alexandros was already moving. Rolling. Coming up in a crouch with feral grace.

Blood ran from his nose where it had struck the floor. His eyes were bright. Furious.

He did not lunge for the bundle.

Instead his hand went to his coat pocket. Pulled out a small glass vial.

The liquid inside caught the lamplight. Amber. Thick.

The scent hit Cornelius half a second later.

Burnt almond. Ozone.

Kiln accelerant. The same compound that had melted the vault seal. The same signature that clung to Alexandros's hands.

But this was different. Concentrated. Mixed with something else. Something that made Cornelius's scales prickle with instinctive dread.

Liquid fire.

The alchemical weapon banned by Council decree after the warehouse fires twenty years ago. Volatile. Uncontrollable once ignited.

Capable of turning stone to slag.

Capable of burning through an entire library in minutes.

"I tried to be reasonable," Alexandros said. He held the vial up. Let Cornelius see it clearly. "But if I cannot leave with the letters, then no one gets them."

His gaze swept the dome. The rows of shelves. The thousands of books and scrolls and manuscripts.

Cornelius's hoard.

"One vial. That is all it takes. Throw it at the stacks. Watch your precious collection burn." Alexandros's smile was terrible. Empty. "You get maybe thirty seconds to choose. Save the books or stop me."

The world narrowed.

Cornelius's entire body went rigid. Wings locked. Tail coiled so tight it ached.

The hoard-prickle flared between his scales. Sharp. Overwhelming. Every instinct screaming at him that his sanctuary was under threat.

Not just the letters.

Everything.

Two centuries of history. Knowledge. Stories. The careful accumulation of civilization preserved in ink and paper.

All of it about to burn.

Unless he stopped it.

Unless he chose.

Alexandros was already drawing his arm back. Preparing to throw.

Cornelius moved.

Not toward Alexandros.

Toward the trajectory.

His mind calculated angles with the same precision he used to catalogue damaged manuscripts. The vial would arc toward the eastern stacks. The section housing the oldest, most fragile volumes. Irreplaceable.

Three seconds to impact.

Two.

Cornelius launched himself from the table. Wings spread. Claws extended.

Flying directly into the path of liquid fire.

The vial left Alexandros's hand.

Spun through the air.

Amber glass catching lamplight.

Cornelius hit it mid-flight.

His claws closed around the vial. Absorbed the momentum. His wings beat frantically. Compensating for the sudden weight.

He had it.

Had caught it.

The glass was warm against his scales. The liquid inside sloshed. Volatile. Unstable.

One crack. One drop. One spark.

And the library would burn anyway.

Cornelius twisted in the air. Dove toward the floor. Away from the shelves. Away from anything flammable.

He landed hard. Rolled. Came up still clutching the vial in both claws.

Safe.

The books were safe.

And he was within arm's reach of Alexandros Doukas.

Exactly where he had sworn never to be.

The man was already moving. Closing the distance. His expression had shifted from cold amusement to something darker.

Rage.

"You should have let it burn," Alexandros said.

He lunged.

Cornelius dropped the vial. Let it roll away across the waxed floor toward the circulation desk. Toward Zeph. Toward safety.

He did not have time to check if it reached the boy.

Alexandros's hand was coming for his throat.

The same grip that had choked him in the alley. The same casual violence that had killed Elias of Tyre.

Cornelius's tail lashed out.

Low. Fast. The way he cleared fallen books from shelves when his claws were full.

It caught Alexandros across the shins.

The sweep was precise. Timed to the man's forward momentum.

Alexandros's legs went out from under him.

He dropped.

Cornelius was smaller. Lighter. Lower to the ground.

He moved while Alexandros was falling.

Spun. Used the momentum of his tail-sweep to position himself.

Landed on Alexandros's back the moment the man hit the floor.

Claws dug into fabric. Into flesh. Holding on with every ounce of strength his small body possessed.

His wings spread wide. Blocking vision. Creating confusion.

His hind claws found purchase just above Alexandros's kidneys. Pressure points. The same spots he used when climbing unstable shelving.

Applied with intent.

Alexandros roared. Tried to roll. To throw him off.

Cornelius's tail wrapped around the man's neck. Not choking. Not yet. But ready.

Control.

He had control.

"Do. Not. Move." Cornelius's voice was rough. Shaking. But clear. "Or I will crush your windpipe."

It was a bluff. Mostly. His tail was strong enough to catalogue heavy folios. To carry small crates. Whether it could actually—

Alexandros went still.

Not because of the threat.

Because he was calculating.

Cornelius could feel it. The tension in the man's muscles. The way his breathing had gone shallow and controlled.

Planning.

"Zeph!" Cornelius called out. Did not take his eyes off the man beneath him. "The whistle! Now!"

Behind the circulation desk, Zeph moved.

Three sharp blasts cut through the dome.

Piercing. Echoing.

The emergency summons.

The sound barely faded before Alexandros moved again.

Fast. Violent.

He bucked. Twisted with strength that should not have been possible from someone pinned face-down.

Cornelius's claws scrabbled for purchase. His tail tightened reflexively.

Not enough.

Alexandros threw him.

Cornelius hit the floor. Slid across the waxed section. His wings crumpled beneath him. Pain flared hot through his left shoulder.

He rolled. Came up. Oriented himself.

Alexandros was on his feet. Blood streamed from new scratches across his neck and back. His coat was shredded. His breathing ragged.

But he was standing.

And the oilcloth bundle—the stolen letters—was still on the floor behind him.

Alexandros did not go for the letters.

He went for Cornelius.

No more calculations. No more cold assessment.

Just rage.

The man crossed the remaining distance in two strides. Grabbed for Cornelius's neck.

Cornelius twisted. Smaller. Faster.

The hand missed.

Caught his wing instead.

Agony shot through Cornelius's shoulder. The delicate membrane tore. He felt it rip. Felt the wrongness of broken structure.

His vision greyed.

No.

Not now.

Not when he was this close.

Cornelius bit.

His fangs were small. Designed for nibbling pen tips and testing paper quality. Not combat.

But they were sharp.

He sank them into the meat of Alexandros's thumb. Tasted blood. Copper and salt.

Alexandros jerked back with a shout.

Released the wing.

Cornelius dropped to the floor. His injured wing would not fold properly. Pain radiated with every heartbeat.

He did not care.

He was still between Alexandros and the letters.

Still standing.

"You cannot win this," Alexandros said. His voice was thick. Strained. "You are a library dragon. You catalog books. This is not your domain."

"You are wrong." Cornelius's voice came out steadier than he felt. "This is exactly my domain. My library. My hoard. And you do not belong here."

Alexandros's expression shifted.

Understanding. Belated. Too late.

He had underestimated the dragon.

Had thought small size meant weakness. Had thought a love of books meant softness.

Had forgotten that dragons—even small ones—were still dragons.

And a dragon defending its hoard was the most dangerous creature in any domain.

Cornelius's wings spread. The injured one hung wrong but he ignored it.

Made himself larger. More threatening.

His claws scored the floor. Stone dust rose.

"The Watch is coming," he said. "You have perhaps two minutes before they breach the main doors. You cannot reach the letters, cross this floor, and escape the building."

"I could kill you in thirty seconds."

"Perhaps." Cornelius's tail coiled. Ready. "But the letters would still be here. And you would still be trapped."

Alexandros's gaze flicked to the barricaded corridor. The main doors. The windows too high and narrow for a human to exit.

Trapped.

His hands curled into fists.

Then he smiled again.

That terrible, empty smile.

"You are right," he said. "I cannot leave with the letters."

He moved.

Not toward Cornelius.

Toward the vial of liquid fire that had rolled across the floor.

That now sat in the shadow of the circulation desk.

Where Zeph was hiding.

Cornelius's heart stopped.

"NO!"

He lunged. Wings flaring. Ignoring the pain.

Too slow.

Too far.

Alexandros reached the vial. Scooped it up. Raised it high.

Aimed at Zeph.

And hesitated.

Because Zeph was not hiding anymore.

The boy stood. Fully visible. One hand gripping the edge of the circulation desk.

The other hand holding Cornelius's incident ledger.

The private documentation of the entire investigation. Dates. Observations. Conclusions.

Proof.

"You throw that," Zeph said. His voice shook but held steady. "And I throw this into the fire with it. All the evidence burns. No one ever proves what you did."

Alexandros froze.

"But if you drop the vial and surrender," Zeph continued. "Maybe Captain Melas goes easy on you. Maybe."

It was a bluff. The Watch did not negotiate with murderers.

But it was a calculated bluff. The kind Cornelius himself might have attempted.

Alexandros's hand trembled. The vial caught lamplight.

"That ledger is worthless," he said. "A dragon's paranoid scribblings. No court would accept it."

"Then you have nothing to lose by letting us keep it." Zeph's grip tightened. "Unless you are worried it actually does prove you killed Elias."

The silence stretched.

Taut. Fragile.

Cornelius stayed frozen. Halfway between Alexandros and Zeph. Wings spread. Every muscle locked.

Waiting.

Then—

Footsteps.

Heavy. Multiple.

Outside the main doors.

Metal clanking. Voices shouting orders.

The Watch.

Alexandros's gaze snapped to the doors. Back to Zeph. To Cornelius.

Calculating one final time.

Then his shoulders dropped.

Defeat.

He set the vial down. Carefully. On the floor.

Straightened.

Raised his empty hands.

"I surrender," he said. His voice was flat. Empty. "To the Watch. Not to a dragon and a boy playing detective."

The main doors shuddered.

Once.

Twice.

On the third impact the bar splintered.

The doors burst open.

Captain Theo Melas entered first. Sword drawn. Four guards behind him. All armed. All ready for violence.

They stopped.

Took in the scene.

The waxed floor. The damaged ladder barricade. The scattered papers and overturned tables.

Cornelius perched on a reading table. Wings spread. Blood on his claws. One wing clearly injured.

Zeph behind the circulation desk. White-knuckled grip on Cornelius's ledger.

Alexandros in the center. Hands raised. Blood streaming from scratches on his neck and face.

And on the floor between them, the oilcloth bundle.

Forty years of Kallistos correspondence.

Theo's gaze swept the room once more. Cataloging. Processing.

Then locked onto Alexandros.

"Alexandros Doukas," he said. His voice carried the weight of official authority. "You are under arrest for the murder of Elias of Tyre. The theft of property from the Kallistos family vault. Assault on a Curator. And attempted arson against a civic building."

He gestured. Two guards moved forward. Grabbed Alexandros's arms. Locked manacles around his wrists with sharp metallic clicks.

Alexandros did not resist.

Did not speak.

Just stared at Cornelius with cold, empty eyes.

Theo approached the oilcloth bundle. Crouched. Examined it without touching.

"This is the stolen correspondence?"

"Yes," Cornelius said. His voice was rough. Shaking with exhaustion and fading adrenaline. "Alexandros retrieved it from the Intake Chute. He melted the service door to enter the building. He attempted to burn the library to cover his escape."

Theo's expression hardened.

He straightened. Turned to face Alexandros fully.

"Arson against a civic building during Spring Feast." Theo's voice was ice. "The Council Charter is explicit. The fine is death."

Alexandros's mask cracked.

Just for a moment.

Fear flashed across his face. Real. Raw.

Then the guards dragged him toward the doors.

Theo watched them go. Then turned back to Cornelius.

"You have a lot of explaining to do, Curator."

"I have documentation." Cornelius gestured with one wing toward where Zeph still held the ledger. Pain flared. He ignored it. "Complete incident logs. Timeline. Evidence chain. Everything you will need."

Theo's expression shifted. Something that might have been respect flickered in his eyes.

"You broke into a sealed crime scene."

"I entered my own library through an architectural vulnerability to prevent a murder suspect from destroying evidence."

"That is still breaking in."

"Then charge me." Cornelius's tail coiled. "After you read my report."

A long silence.

Then Theo sighed.

Rubbed his face with both hands.

"You are a dragon who runs a library," he said.

It was the same dismissal from weeks ago. The same reduction of Cornelius's role and importance.

But this time Theo was smiling.

"And apparently," he continued, "you are also the most stubborn investigator I have ever had the displeasure of working with."

It was not quite an apology.

But it was close enough.

Cornelius's wings folded. The injured one hurt terribly but he forced it down. Forced himself to stand straight.

Professional. Composed.

Even with blood on his claws and his hoard in chaos around him.

"The library is secure," he said. "The evidence is intact. Justice will be served."

"Yes," Theo agreed. "It will."

He gestured to the remaining guards. "Secure this room. No one touches anything until I have read that ledger and taken full statements."

The guards moved to comply.

Theo approached Cornelius. Stood looking down at the small dragon perched on the reading table.

"Off the record," he said quietly. "Thank you. For not giving up. For proving I was wrong."

Cornelius inclined his head. A small, precise gesture.

"You are welcome, Captain."

Theo nodded. Turned to coordinate with his guards.

Leaving Cornelius alone on his table.

In his library.

His hoard.

Damaged. Disordered. Coated in bookbinder's wax and blood.

But safe.

Across the room, Zeph emerged from behind the circulation desk. Still clutching the ledger. His hands shook.

"Is it over?" the boy asked. His voice was very small.

"Yes," Cornelius said. "It is over."

Zeph crossed the floor. Careful of the wax. Of the scattered evidence. Of the guards moving through the space.

He reached Cornelius's table.

Set the ledger down gently.

Then reached out and very carefully touched Cornelius's injured wing with one finger.

"You are hurt."

"It will heal."

"You saved the books."

"Of course I did." Cornelius's tail coiled. "They are my hoard."

Zeph's expression shifted. Something warm. Proud.

"Our hoard," he said.

And despite everything—the pain, the exhaustion, the chaos—

Cornelius felt his maw twitch.

Almost a smile.

"Yes," he agreed. "Our hoard."
