# Chapter 1

"You cannot bring that pastry into my library."

Cornelius Drake peered over the edge of the second-floor railing, adjusting his gold-rimmed spectacles with one claw. The offending item—a spiral of phyllo dough dusted with crushed pistachios—was currently clutched in the hand of his intern, who stood frozen in the entrance with his mouth already open for a bite.

Zephyr Taraki looked up, then down at the pastry, then back up. "It's just a kataifi."

"It is a *disaster*." Cornelius descended the carved stone stairs with the deliberate precision of a cat stalking a particularly annoying moth. His bronze and copper scales caught the amber light filtering through the dome's colored glass, turning him into a small, indignant beacon. "Phyllo dough sheds approximately four hundred individual fragments per square inch of surface area. You are holding what amounts to an edible dust storm."

Zeph took a bite. Crumbs cascaded onto the mosaic floor.

"Unacceptable." Cornelius stopped three steps from the bottom, positioning himself at eye level with the boy. "You will consume that outside, or I will catalogue you under 'Hazardous Waste' and shelve you in the alley."

"You can't shelve people."

"I can if they are producing debris at a rate that threatens my floor's finish."

Zeph grinned, which made his unruly black hair—gleaming with that odd bronze sheen it always carried in bright light—fall across his eyes. He was sixteen, gangly, and had Been employed as the Spring Intern for exactly forty-three days. Cornelius had counted. "Your floor is four hundred years old. I don't think my breakfast is gonna kill it."

"The floor has survived four centuries because people did not eat structural pastries on top of it." Cornelius sniffed. The library smelled correct this morning: vanilla from aging paper, dust from the high shelves, and the faint herbal note of the mint he had been trimming in the Curator's office. The addition of warm honey and butter was an *intrusion*. "Outside. Now."

The boy sighed, shuffled backward through the arched doorway, and took another aggressive bite on the threshold. More crumbs fell on the outer step. "Happy?"

"Moderately." Cornelius turned, tail sweeping in a perfect arc, and returned to his morning rounds. He had been inspecting the Philosophy section when the bell above the door had jangled with entirely unnecessary violence. The interruption had displaced his entire mental index.

Behind him, Zeph called, "You know the Feast starts today, right? The whole town's gonna be in here tracking mud and asking stupid questions for a week."

Cornelius paused mid-step. His scales prickled.

The Spring Trading Feast.

Of course he knew. He had been dreading it for a month. The annual week-long festival transformed Solterra Bay from a quiet, orderly port town into a seething carnival of foreign sailors, merchants hawking questionable goods, and citizens who suddenly forgot the basic concept of *indoor voices*. Last year, someone had tried to return a book with fish scales pressed between the pages. The year before that, a tourist had asked if he was "a statue or a really ugly cat."

"I am aware," Cornelius said. He climbed the rolling ladder anchored to the Philosophy shelves and examined the spines. Plato, Aristotle, Epictetus. All aligned. Dust levels acceptable. "The Feast is a necessary economic function. I tolerate it."

"You hide in your office and put up a 'Silence Enforced' sign."

"As I said. I tolerate it." He descended and moved to the next shelf. Heraclitus was missing. No—there. Someone had mis-shelved it with the poetry. Unacceptable. He retrieved it, dusted the cover, and placed it in its correct position. "You may finish your pastry and then begin the morning opening procedures. The reading tables require oil, and the History section needs dusting."

Zeph groaned.

"You accepted this internship voluntarily."

"I accepted it because my mom said I needed 'work experience' for the Academy application."

"Then you are receiving exactly what you requested." Cornelius tilted his head, examining the boy through the doorway. Zephyr Taraki was technically human, though his ancestry included something *other*—some ancient bloodline that manifested in the bronze sheen of his hair and the way he sometimes stared at the library's columns as though listening to a voice no one else could hear. Lamassu, perhaps. Guardian stock. Not that it mattered. The boy was still inefficient, distractible, and refused to follow the clearly posted shelving system.

But he showed up on time. And he had fixed the broken hinge on the archive door without being asked.

Cornelius would not admit this aloud, but the boy was... acceptable.

Zeph finished the pastry, wiped his hands on his tunic, and stepped back inside. "Okay. Tables. Oil. Dust. Anything else, or can I actually help patrons today?"

"You may assist patrons after you have completed your tasks to standard."

"What's 'standard'?"

"When I do not find fault."

"So, never."

"Precisely." Cornelius launched himself from the stairs, wings snapping open, and glided to the main desk. He landed beside the intake ledger and flipped it open with one claw. Sixteen items returned yesterday. All logged. All re-shelved. Excellent. He dipped his pen in the inkwell and noted the date in his personal record: *Spring Feast, Day One. Dread Level: Moderate.*

The bell jangled again.

Cornelius closed his eyes. Counted to three. Opened them.

A man stood in the doorway, breathing too fast. He was human, mid-twenties, with the dark skin and calloused hands of a sailor. His tunic bore the blue spiral emblem of a certified courier. Sweat darkened his collar despite the cool stone interior of the library.

"Delivery," the man said. His voice cracked. "For the Kallistos Vault."

Cornelius set down his pen. "The private collections are not accessible during the Feast. Vault access resumes after the Storm Wards are reinstated."

"I know. I'm just—" The courier stepped forward, pulling a wrapped package from his satchel. It was small, rectangular, bound in oiled leather. "I'm supposed to leave this with you. For storage. Until Petros Kallistos retrieves it."

Cornelius studied the man. His pupils were dilated. His fingers trembled as he set the package on the desk. There were dark flecks on the leather wrapping—blue dust, fine as pollen. And a smear of something oily near the corner.

"Your name?" Cornelius asked.

"Elias. Of Tyre." The man wiped his palms on his trousers. "It's paid for. The storage fee. Petros handled it last week."

Cornelius leaned forward, nostrils flaring. He smelled salt, sweat, and under that... machine oil. The acidic bite of metal polish. And the dust—yes, lapis lazuli. Ground lapis, the kind used in high-quality ceramic glazes.

Or in certain alchemical formulas.

"What is the contents?" Cornelius asked.

"Papers. Legal documents." Elias's eyes flicked to the package, then away. "Family business. Private."

"Everything stored in this library is documented."

"It's for the *vault*. Petros said—"

"Petros Kallistos does not dictate my policies." Cornelius tapped the intake ledger. "If you wish to store an item, you will declare its contents, its value, and the intended duration of storage. Otherwise, you may take it to the commercial vault at the Trade House."

Elias flinched. "No. It has to be here. The wards—" He stopped himself.

Cornelius's eyes narrowed. "The wards."

"I just mean... it's safer. Here. Right?" Elias forced a smile. It did not reach his eyes. "The library's protections are... strong."

"They are." The Solterra Bay Library was one of three buildings in the city with ancient wards woven into its foundations. Theft was not merely illegal—it was physically difficult. Objects marked for the vault could not pass the threshold without triggering alarms that would wake the entire district. It made the library a popular storage site for the old families.

It also made it a target for those who thought themselves clever.

Cornelius extended one claw and rotated the package. The lapis dust smeared. He tasted the air again. Definitely machine oil. The kind used in lock mechanisms.

"I will accept the package," Cornelius said slowly, "under the condition that you complete the intake form in full. Including your point of origin, your employer, and the declared contents."

"It's just papers."

"Then you will have no difficulty declaring them."

Elias stared at him. Sweat beaded on his upper lip. For a long moment, Cornelius thought the man might simply grab the package and run.

Instead, Elias nodded. "Fine. Where's the form?"

Cornelius produced the parchment and a pen. He watched as the courier filled in the lines with quick, nervous strokes. *Elias of Tyre. Hired agent of House Kallistos. Contents: Correspondence (Private). Value: Sentimental. Duration: Six days.*

The handwriting was terrible. Slanted, inconsistent. The "K" in Kallistos had been corrected twice.

"Acceptable," Cornelius lied. He blotted the form, logged the item, and placed it in the locked drawer reserved for vault transfers. "Petros Kallistos may retrieve this during normal business hours after the Feast. He will need to present identification and his vault key."

"Right. Good." Elias backed toward the door. "Thanks. I—yeah. Thanks."

He fled.

Cornelius watched him go, then returned his attention to the package. The oiled leather wrapping was high quality. Expensive. But the blue dust and the oil residue...

He opened the drawer and examined the package again without touching it. The dust had settled into the grain of the leather in a pattern that suggested it had been set down on a workbench. Recently. And the oil smear was fresh—it gleamed wetly under the amber light.

"That guy was *weird*," Zeph said.

Cornelius turned. The boy had emerged from the storage room with a dust cloth and a bottle of lemon oil. He was staring at the door where Elias had vanished.

"Define weird," Cornelius said.

"I dunno. Jumpy. Like he thought someone was gonna stab him."

"An accurate assessment." Cornelius locked the drawer and pocketed the key. "He exhibited the physiological markers of acute stress. Elevated heart rate, perspiration, dilated pupils."

"So... why'd you take his package?"

"Because refusing it would have been suspicious." Cornelius climbed onto his desk and sat, curling his tail around his feet. "And because I wish to observe what happens next."

Zeph frowned. "You think he's lying?"

"I think the contents of that package are not 'sentimental correspondence.'" Cornelius tapped his claws on the desk. "The dust on the wrapping is powdered lapis lazuli. The smear is light machine oil. Both substances are consistent with the tools used in fine metalwork or locksmithing."

"So... what, he's got lock picks in there?"

"Possibly. Or a key. Or a schematic." Cornelius tilted his head. "Regardless, it is now logged and secured. If it is retrieved legally, no harm is done. If it is *not*..." He smiled, showing a neat row of small, sharp teeth. "Then we will have evidence."

Zeph looked uncertain. "Shouldn't we, like, tell the Watch?"

"And report what? A nervous man delivering a package?" Cornelius shook his head. "Captain Melas has more pressing concerns during the Feast. Unless we have proof of a crime, we have nothing."

"But you think there's gonna *be* a crime."

"I think there is a *possibility* of impropriety." Cornelius hopped down from the desk and headed toward the archive stairs. "Which is why you will make a note of Elias of Tyre's description and report any additional contact. In the meantime, we have work to do. The tables will not oil themselves."

Zeph muttered something that sounded like "neither will your personality," but he grabbed the supplies and headed toward the reading area.

Cornelius allowed himself a small flicker of satisfaction. The boy was learning.

---

Two hours later, Cornelius regretted leaving the library.

The main square of Solterra Bay was a riot of color and noise. Merchants had erected their stalls overnight, transforming the open plaza into a labyrinth of canvas and rope. Vendors shouted in four languages, advertising spices from the southern isles, bolts of silk from the eastern kingdoms, and "genuine dragon scales" that were obviously painted fish leather. The smell of grilling meat, anise liquor, and unwashed crowds pressed against Cornelius's senses like a physical weight.

He hated it.

"Why are we here again?" Zeph asked. He was carrying a wicker basket that Cornelius had insisted upon. If they were going to endure the Feast, they might as well acquire supplies.

"Because the herb vendor only appears during the Feast," Cornelius said. He wove between the legs of a tall orc woman haggling over a crate of figs. "And I require fresh mint for the reading room diffusers."

"You know you can just... buy mint at the regular market, right?"

"Not this variety. This is Mentha suaveolens from the northern hills. It has a subtle apple note that pairs correctly with old paper." Cornelius stopped at a stall draped in green fabric. Bundles of herbs hung from the crossbeams, filling the air with sharp, clean scents.

The vendor—a satyr with flour on her hooves—grinned down at him. "Back again, Curator?"

"Three bundles. The usual quality."

"You got it." She pulled down the freshest sprigs and wrapped them in paper. "Heard you've got a body in your vault."

Cornelius went still. "I beg your pardon?"

"The Kallistos vault. Someone said there was a break-in." She handed him the packet. "That true?"

"There has been no break-in." Cornelius placed the mint in Zeph's basket with more force than necessary. "The vault is sealed and monitored. Rumors to the contrary are false."

The satyr shrugged. "If you say so. Just what I heard."

Cornelius paid and stalked away, tail lashing.

"Whoa," Zeph said, jogging to keep up. "What's her deal?"

"Gossip travels faster than truth in this town." Cornelius scanned the crowd, ears flat. "The Feast brings out the worst in people. Idle speculation, baseless accusations, and—"

He stopped.

Across the square, near the fountain, two figures stood in heated conversation. One was Elias of Tyre, the nervous courier. The other was a woman in a deep blue dress, her dark hair pinned with silver combs. Even from this distance, Cornelius recognized her: Sophia Doukas, one of the three tile-making families that dominated Solterra Bay's economy.

Elias was gesturing sharply. Sophia had her arms crossed, her expression flat and cold. As Cornelius watched, she leaned in and said something that made Elias step back as though struck.

"Is that the jumpy guy?" Zeph asked.

"Yes." Cornelius moved closer, using the crowd as cover. His hearing was excellent—better than human, though not as sharp as a hound's. He angled his head, filtering out the background noise.

"—not what we agreed," Elias was saying. His voice shook. "You said the sequence was simple. You said—"

"I said you would be paid when the task is *complete*." Sophia's voice was ice. "Not when you lose your nerve."

"I'm not losing my nerve. I'm telling you, the wards are stronger than you thought. If I try to—"

"Then do not try. Do it." Sophia stepped back, smoothing her skirts. Cornelius caught a flash of blue thread along the hem—a repair, neat but visible. "You made a promise, Elias. I suggest you keep it."

She turned and walked away, heels clicking on the stone.

Elias stood alone by the fountain, staring at his hands. Then he turned and disappeared into the crowd in the opposite direction.

Cornelius's claws dug into the cobblestones.

"Did you hear that?" Zeph whispered.

"Every word." Cornelius watched the space where Sophia had been. She was beautiful, polished, and utterly composed. She was also, apparently, hiring nervous couriers to breach magical wards.

"Should we follow her?"

Cornelius considered. Then he shook his head. "No. Not yet. We do not have enough information."

"But she's obviously—"

"Obviously involved in something. Yes." Cornelius turned back toward the library. "But involvement is not proof. We will observe. We will document. And if a crime occurs, we will have witnesses and evidence."

"And if it doesn't?"

"Then we have wasted an afternoon being suspicious, which is preferable to wasting it being robbed." Cornelius flicked his tail. "Come. I want to return before the vault transfers are logged for the day."

They walked back through the Feast crowds in silence. Cornelius's mind churned. The package. The lapis dust. The oil. The wards. The nervous courier and the cold tile-maker. The promise. The sequence.

It fit together. He simply did not yet know how.

---

The library was blessedly cool and quiet when they returned. Cornelius went immediately to the vault transfer drawer and checked the lock. Intact. Undisturbed. The package sat exactly where he had left it.

He locked the drawer again and climbed the stairs to the rafters. His private space was a platform of worn wood tucked beneath the dome, invisible from the ground. He kept his personal ledgers here, his favorite books, and a small stash of dried crickets for when he did not wish to hunt.

He pulled out the logbook and opened it to a blank page.

*Spring Feast, Day One,* he wrote. *Incident Log.*

*10:00 — Elias of Tyre delivers package for Kallistos Vault. Exhibits stress. Package shows residue of lapis dust and machine oil.*

*12:30 — Observed Elias arguing with Sophia Doukas in main square. Conversation referenced "wards," "promise," and "sequence." Tone adversarial.*

*Conclusion: Potential coordinated effort to breach vault security. Motive unknown. Suspect: Sophia Doukas (primary), Elias of Tyre (agent/tool).*

He set down the pen and stared at the words.

It was speculation. Thin speculation. But his instincts—honed over a century of guarding books—rarely failed him.

Something was wrong.

He closed the book and returned to the main floor. Zeph was oiling the tables as instructed, his strokes slow and methodical. The boy had actually done it correctly.

"Good work," Cornelius said.

Zeph looked up, startled. "Seriously?"

"Do not make me repeat myself."

The boy grinned.

Cornelius allowed himself a small flicker of warmth. Then he turned toward the vault door—the heavy iron portal set into the western wall, marked with the spiral seal of House Kallistos. It was locked. Warded. Protected by magic older than the town itself.

It should be safe.

But as Cornelius stood there, staring at the iron, he felt it.

A prickle. Sharp and cold, running between his scales like a trickle of ice water.

The feeling a dragon got when something threatened his hoard.

He turned slowly, scanning the library. The shelves stood silent. The dome above filtered amber light onto the mosaic floor. Everything was in its place.

But the prickle remained.

Cornelius walked to the nearest window and looked out at the Feast. The crowds surged and swirled, a chaos of color and sound.

Somewhere in that chaos, a plan was in motion.

And his library—his sanctuary, his hoard, his *silence*—was the target.

He adjusted his spectacles and returned to his desk.

He would be ready.
