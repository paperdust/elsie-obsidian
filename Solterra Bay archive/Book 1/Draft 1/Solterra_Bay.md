# Chapter 1

"You cannot bring that pastry into my library."

Cornelius Drake peered over the edge of the second-floor railing, adjusting his gold-rimmed spectacles with one claw. The offending item—a spiral of phyllo dough dusted with crushed pistachios—was currently clutched in the hand of his intern, who stood frozen in the entrance with his mouth already open for a bite.

Zephyr Taraki looked up, then down at the pastry, then back up. "It's just a kataifi."

"It is a *disaster*." Cornelius descended the carved stone stairs with the deliberate precision of a cat stalking a particularly annoying moth. His bronze and copper scales caught the amber light filtering through the dome's colored glass, turning him into a small, indignant beacon. "Phyllo dough sheds approximately four hundred individual fragments per square inch of surface area. You are holding what amounts to an edible dust storm."

Zeph took a bite. Crumbs cascaded onto the mosaic floor.

"Unacceptable." Cornelius stopped three steps from the bottom, positioning himself at eye level with the boy. "You will consume that outside, or I will catalogue you under 'Hazardous Waste' and shelve you in the alley."

"You can't shelve people."

"I can if they are producing debris at a rate that threatens my floor's finish."

Zeph grinned, which made his unruly black hair—gleaming with that odd bronze sheen it always carried in bright light—fall across his eyes. He was sixteen, gangly, and had Been employed as the Spring Intern for exactly forty-three days. Cornelius had counted. "Your floor is four hundred years old. I don't think my breakfast is gonna kill it."

"The floor has survived four centuries because people did not eat structural pastries on top of it." Cornelius sniffed. The library smelled correct this morning: vanilla from aging paper, dust from the high shelves, and the faint herbal note of the mint he had been trimming in the Curator's office. The addition of warm honey and butter was an *intrusion*. "Outside. Now."

The boy sighed, shuffled backward through the arched doorway, and took another aggressive bite on the threshold. More crumbs fell on the outer step. "Happy?"

"Moderately." Cornelius turned, tail sweeping in a perfect arc, and returned to his morning rounds. He had been inspecting the Philosophy section when the bell above the door had jangled with entirely unnecessary violence. The interruption had displaced his entire mental index.

Behind him, Zeph called, "You know the Feast starts today, right? The whole town's gonna be in here tracking mud and asking stupid questions for a week."

Cornelius paused mid-step. His scales prickled.

The Spring Trading Feast.

Of course he knew. He had been dreading it for a month. The annual week-long festival transformed Solterra Bay from a quiet, orderly port town into a seething carnival of foreign sailors, merchants hawking questionable goods, and citizens who suddenly forgot the basic concept of *indoor voices*. Last year, someone had tried to return a book with fish scales pressed between the pages. The year before that, a tourist had asked if he was "a statue or a really ugly cat."

"I am aware," Cornelius said. He climbed the rolling ladder anchored to the Philosophy shelves and examined the spines. Plato, Aristotle, Epictetus. All aligned. Dust levels acceptable. "The Feast is a necessary economic function. I tolerate it."

"You hide in your office and put up a 'Silence Enforced' sign."

"As I said. I tolerate it." He descended and moved to the next shelf. Heraclitus was missing. No—there. Someone had mis-shelved it with the poetry. Unacceptable. He retrieved it, dusted the cover, and placed it in its correct position. "You may finish your pastry and then begin the morning opening procedures. The reading tables require oil, and the History section needs dusting."

Zeph groaned.

"You accepted this internship voluntarily."

"I accepted it because my mom said I needed 'work experience' for the Academy application."

"Then you are receiving exactly what you requested." Cornelius tilted his head, examining the boy through the doorway. Zephyr Taraki was technically human, though his ancestry included something *other*—some ancient bloodline that manifested in the bronze sheen of his hair and the way he sometimes stared at the library's columns as though listening to a voice no one else could hear. Lamassu, perhaps. Guardian stock. Not that it mattered. The boy was still inefficient, distractible, and refused to follow the clearly posted shelving system.

But he showed up on time. And he had fixed the broken hinge on the archive door without being asked.

Cornelius would not admit this aloud, but the boy was... acceptable.

Zeph finished the pastry, wiped his hands on his tunic, and stepped back inside. "Okay. Tables. Oil. Dust. Anything else, or can I actually help patrons today?"

"You may assist patrons after you have completed your tasks to standard."

"What's 'standard'?"

"When I do not find fault."

"So, never."

"Precisely." Cornelius launched himself from the stairs, wings snapping open, and glided to the main desk. He landed beside the intake ledger and flipped it open with one claw. Sixteen items returned yesterday. All logged. All re-shelved. Excellent. He dipped his pen in the inkwell and noted the date in his personal record: *Spring Feast, Day One. Dread Level: Moderate.*

The bell jangled again.

Cornelius closed his eyes. Counted to three. Opened them.

A man stood in the doorway, breathing too fast. He was human, mid-twenties, with the dark skin and calloused hands of a sailor. His tunic bore the blue spiral emblem of a certified courier. Sweat darkened his collar despite the cool stone interior of the library.

"Delivery," the man said. His voice cracked. "For the Kallistos Vault."

Cornelius set down his pen. "The private collections are not accessible during the Feast. Vault access resumes after the Storm Wards are reinstated."

"I know. I'm just—" The courier stepped forward, pulling a wrapped package from his satchel. It was small, rectangular, bound in oiled leather. "I'm supposed to leave this with you. For storage. Until Petros Kallistos retrieves it."

Cornelius studied the man. His pupils were dilated. His fingers trembled as he set the package on the desk. There were dark flecks on the leather wrapping—blue dust, fine as pollen. And a smear of something oily near the corner.

"Your name?" Cornelius asked.

"Elias. Of Tyre." The man wiped his palms on his trousers. "It's paid for. The storage fee. Petros handled it last week."

Cornelius leaned forward, nostrils flaring. He smelled salt, sweat, and under that... machine oil. The acidic bite of metal polish. And the dust—yes, lapis lazuli. Ground lapis, the kind used in high-quality ceramic glazes.

Or in certain alchemical formulas.

"What is the contents?" Cornelius asked.

"Papers. Legal documents." Elias's eyes flicked to the package, then away. "Family business. Private."

"Everything stored in this library is documented."

"It's for the *vault*. Petros said—"

"Petros Kallistos does not dictate my policies." Cornelius tapped the intake ledger. "If you wish to store an item, you will declare its contents, its value, and the intended duration of storage. Otherwise, you may take it to the commercial vault at the Trade House."

Elias flinched. "No. It has to be here. The wards—" He stopped himself.

Cornelius's eyes narrowed. "The wards."

"I just mean... it's safer. Here. Right?" Elias forced a smile. It did not reach his eyes. "The library's protections are... strong."

"They are." The Solterra Bay Library was one of three buildings in the city with ancient wards woven into its foundations. Theft was not merely illegal—it was physically difficult. Objects marked for the vault could not pass the threshold without triggering alarms that would wake the entire district. It made the library a popular storage site for the old families.

It also made it a target for those who thought themselves clever.

Cornelius extended one claw and rotated the package. The lapis dust smeared. He tasted the air again. Definitely machine oil. The kind used in lock mechanisms.

"I will accept the package," Cornelius said slowly, "under the condition that you complete the intake form in full. Including your point of origin, your employer, and the declared contents."

"It's just papers."

"Then you will have no difficulty declaring them."

Elias stared at him. Sweat beaded on his upper lip. For a long moment, Cornelius thought the man might simply grab the package and run.

Instead, Elias nodded. "Fine. Where's the form?"

Cornelius produced the parchment and a pen. He watched as the courier filled in the lines with quick, nervous strokes. *Elias of Tyre. Hired agent of House Kallistos. Contents: Correspondence (Private). Value: Sentimental. Duration: Six days.*

The handwriting was terrible. Slanted, inconsistent. The "K" in Kallistos had been corrected twice.

"Acceptable," Cornelius lied. He blotted the form, logged the item, and placed it in the locked drawer reserved for vault transfers. "Petros Kallistos may retrieve this during normal business hours after the Feast. He will need to present identification and his vault key."

"Right. Good." Elias backed toward the door. "Thanks. I—yeah. Thanks."

He fled.

Cornelius watched him go, then returned his attention to the package. The oiled leather wrapping was high quality. Expensive. But the blue dust and the oil residue...

He opened the drawer and examined the package again without touching it. The dust had settled into the grain of the leather in a pattern that suggested it had been set down on a workbench. Recently. And the oil smear was fresh—it gleamed wetly under the amber light.

"That guy was *weird*," Zeph said.

Cornelius turned. The boy had emerged from the storage room with a dust cloth and a bottle of lemon oil. He was staring at the door where Elias had vanished.

"Define weird," Cornelius said.

"I dunno. Jumpy. Like he thought someone was gonna stab him."

"An accurate assessment." Cornelius locked the drawer and pocketed the key. "He exhibited the physiological markers of acute stress. Elevated heart rate, perspiration, dilated pupils."

"So... why'd you take his package?"

"Because refusing it would have been suspicious." Cornelius climbed onto his desk and sat, curling his tail around his feet. "And because I wish to observe what happens next."

Zeph frowned. "You think he's lying?"

"I think the contents of that package are not 'sentimental correspondence.'" Cornelius tapped his claws on the desk. "The dust on the wrapping is powdered lapis lazuli. The smear is light machine oil. Both substances are consistent with the tools used in fine metalwork or locksmithing."

"So... what, he's got lock picks in there?"

"Possibly. Or a key. Or a schematic." Cornelius tilted his head. "Regardless, it is now logged and secured. If it is retrieved legally, no harm is done. If it is *not*..." He smiled, showing a neat row of small, sharp teeth. "Then we will have evidence."

Zeph looked uncertain. "Shouldn't we, like, tell the Watch?"

"And report what? A nervous man delivering a package?" Cornelius shook his head. "Captain Melas has more pressing concerns during the Feast. Unless we have proof of a crime, we have nothing."

"But you think there's gonna *be* a crime."

"I think there is a *possibility* of impropriety." Cornelius hopped down from the desk and headed toward the archive stairs. "Which is why you will make a note of Elias of Tyre's description and report any additional contact. In the meantime, we have work to do. The tables will not oil themselves."

Zeph muttered something that sounded like "neither will your personality," but he grabbed the supplies and headed toward the reading area.

Cornelius allowed himself a small flicker of satisfaction. The boy was learning.

---

Two hours later, Cornelius regretted leaving the library.

The main square of Solterra Bay was a riot of color and noise. Merchants had erected their stalls overnight, transforming the open plaza into a labyrinth of canvas and rope. Vendors shouted in four languages, advertising spices from the southern isles, bolts of silk from the eastern kingdoms, and "genuine dragon scales" that were obviously painted fish leather. The smell of grilling meat, anise liquor, and unwashed crowds pressed against Cornelius's senses like a physical weight.

He hated it.

"Why are we here again?" Zeph asked. He was carrying a wicker basket that Cornelius had insisted upon. If they were going to endure the Feast, they might as well acquire supplies.

"Because the herb vendor only appears during the Feast," Cornelius said. He wove between the legs of a tall orc woman haggling over a crate of figs. "And I require fresh mint for the reading room diffusers."

"You know you can just... buy mint at the regular market, right?"

"Not this variety. This is Mentha suaveolens from the northern hills. It has a subtle apple note that pairs correctly with old paper." Cornelius stopped at a stall draped in green fabric. Bundles of herbs hung from the crossbeams, filling the air with sharp, clean scents.

The vendor—a satyr with flour on her hooves—grinned down at him. "Back again, Curator?"

"Three bundles. The usual quality."

"You got it." She pulled down the freshest sprigs and wrapped them in paper. "Heard you've got a body in your vault."

Cornelius went still. "I beg your pardon?"

"The Kallistos vault. Someone said there was a break-in." She handed him the packet. "That true?"

"There has been no break-in." Cornelius placed the mint in Zeph's basket with more force than necessary. "The vault is sealed and monitored. Rumors to the contrary are false."

The satyr shrugged. "If you say so. Just what I heard."

Cornelius paid and stalked away, tail lashing.

"Whoa," Zeph said, jogging to keep up. "What's her deal?"

"Gossip travels faster than truth in this town." Cornelius scanned the crowd, ears flat. "The Feast brings out the worst in people. Idle speculation, baseless accusations, and—"

He stopped.

Across the square, near the fountain, two figures stood in heated conversation. One was Elias of Tyre, the nervous courier. The other was a woman in a deep blue dress, her dark hair pinned with silver combs. Even from this distance, Cornelius recognized her: Sophia Doukas, one of the three tile-making families that dominated Solterra Bay's economy.

Elias was gesturing sharply. Sophia had her arms crossed, her expression flat and cold. As Cornelius watched, she leaned in and said something that made Elias step back as though struck.

"Is that the jumpy guy?" Zeph asked.

"Yes." Cornelius moved closer, using the crowd as cover. His hearing was excellent—better than human, though not as sharp as a hound's. He angled his head, filtering out the background noise.

"—not what we agreed," Elias was saying. His voice shook. "You said the sequence was simple. You said—"

"I said you would be paid when the task is *complete*." Sophia's voice was ice. "Not when you lose your nerve."

"I'm not losing my nerve. I'm telling you, the wards are stronger than you thought. If I try to—"

"Then do not try. Do it." Sophia stepped back, smoothing her skirts. Cornelius caught a flash of blue thread along the hem—a repair, neat but visible. "You made a promise, Elias. I suggest you keep it."

She turned and walked away, heels clicking on the stone.

Elias stood alone by the fountain, staring at his hands. Then he turned and disappeared into the crowd in the opposite direction.

Cornelius's claws dug into the cobblestones.

"Did you hear that?" Zeph whispered.

"Every word." Cornelius watched the space where Sophia had been. She was beautiful, polished, and utterly composed. She was also, apparently, hiring nervous couriers to breach magical wards.

"Should we follow her?"

Cornelius considered. Then he shook his head. "No. Not yet. We do not have enough information."

"But she's obviously—"

"Obviously involved in something. Yes." Cornelius turned back toward the library. "But involvement is not proof. We will observe. We will document. And if a crime occurs, we will have witnesses and evidence."

"And if it doesn't?"

"Then we have wasted an afternoon being suspicious, which is preferable to wasting it being robbed." Cornelius flicked his tail. "Come. I want to return before the vault transfers are logged for the day."

They walked back through the Feast crowds in silence. Cornelius's mind churned. The package. The lapis dust. The oil. The wards. The nervous courier and the cold tile-maker. The promise. The sequence.

It fit together. He simply did not yet know how.

---

The library was blessedly cool and quiet when they returned. Cornelius went immediately to the vault transfer drawer and checked the lock. Intact. Undisturbed. The package sat exactly where he had left it.

He locked the drawer again and climbed the stairs to the rafters. His private space was a platform of worn wood tucked beneath the dome, invisible from the ground. He kept his personal ledgers here, his favorite books, and a small stash of dried crickets for when he did not wish to hunt.

He pulled out the logbook and opened it to a blank page.

*Spring Feast, Day One,* he wrote. *Incident Log.*

*10:00 — Elias of Tyre delivers package for Kallistos Vault. Exhibits stress. Package shows residue of lapis dust and machine oil.*

*12:30 — Observed Elias arguing with Sophia Doukas in main square. Conversation referenced "wards," "promise," and "sequence." Tone adversarial.*

*Conclusion: Potential coordinated effort to breach vault security. Motive unknown. Suspect: Sophia Doukas (primary), Elias of Tyre (agent/tool).*

He set down the pen and stared at the words.

It was speculation. Thin speculation. But his instincts—honed over a century of guarding books—rarely failed him.

Something was wrong.

He closed the book and returned to the main floor. Zeph was oiling the tables as instructed, his strokes slow and methodical. The boy had actually done it correctly.

"Good work," Cornelius said.

Zeph looked up, startled. "Seriously?"

"Do not make me repeat myself."

The boy grinned.

Cornelius allowed himself a small flicker of warmth. Then he turned toward the vault door—the heavy iron portal set into the western wall, marked with the spiral seal of House Kallistos. It was locked. Warded. Protected by magic older than the town itself.

It should be safe.

But as Cornelius stood there, staring at the iron, he felt it.

A prickle. Sharp and cold, running between his scales like a trickle of ice water.

The feeling a dragon got when something threatened his hoard.

He turned slowly, scanning the library. The shelves stood silent. The dome above filtered amber light onto the mosaic floor. Everything was in its place.

But the prickle remained.

Cornelius walked to the nearest window and looked out at the Feast. The crowds surged and swirled, a chaos of color and sound.

Somewhere in that chaos, a plan was in motion.

And his library—his sanctuary, his hoard, his *silence*—was the target.

He adjusted his spectacles and returned to his desk.

He would be ready.

# Chapter 2

# Chapter 2

Cornelius arrived at the library at dawn, as he did every morning. The key turned in the lock with its familiar click. The door swung open on hinges he had oiled himself three weeks prior. The mosaic floor gleamed in the amber light filtering through the dome.

Everything was exactly as it should be.

Except for the smell.

Cornelius stopped on the threshold, nostrils flaring. The vanilla-and-dust scent of his domain had been corrupted. Something acrid cut through it—sharp, metallic, wrong. He recognized it immediately: ozone. The residue magic left in the air when it was used for something larger than mending a hinge or cooling a room.

His scales prickled.

He stepped inside and closed the door behind him with deliberate care. The library was silent. No patrons yet. Zeph would not arrive for another hour. The stillness should have been comforting.

It was not.

Cornelius moved across the floor, claws clicking softly on stone. His eyes swept the main room. The shelves stood undisturbed. The reading tables were clean. The intake ledger sat exactly where he had left it.

The smell grew stronger as he approached the western wall.

The Kallistos vault.

The iron door—heavy, ancient, marked with the spiral seal of House Kallistos—was closed. But the seal itself...

Cornelius stopped three feet away and stared.

The metal around the lock had melted. Not rusted. Not corroded. *Melted*. The iron had run like candle wax, pooling at the base of the door in a solidified puddle. The spiral emblem, once crisp and proud, sagged like a wound.

Someone had breached his library.

The thought arrived cold and sharp, cutting through his shock. His wings snapped open reflexively, an instinctive threat display. The air around him felt too thin. His vision narrowed to the ruined seal, the desecration of his sanctuary.

He forced himself to breathe. Forced his wings to fold. Forced his mind to *work*.

Evidence. He needed evidence.

Cornelius approached the door and extended one claw, stopping just short of touching the melted iron. Heat radiated from it—faint, but present. The breach was recent. Within the last few hours.

He tasted the air again. Ozone, yes. But underneath it... something else. Sweet and bitter at once, like almonds left too long in the sun.

Burnt almond.

Cornelius knew that smell. He had read about it in his collection of alchemical texts, in the treatises on poisons and their applications. Cyanide compounds produced that scent when they reacted with living tissue.

Someone had not only breached the vault.

Someone had died doing it.

He pushed the door. It swung open with a groan of tortured metal.

The vault was small—ten feet by ten, lined with stone shelves. Petros Kallistos stored his family's private documents here: contracts, deeds, letters written in hands long dead. All of it catalogued, logged, and protected by wards that had stood for two centuries.

The wards had failed.

Or been bypassed.

Cornelius stepped inside, his gaze sweeping the shelves. Most of the contents remained untouched. Scrolls sat rolled and tied. Leather portfolios leaned against the wall. But the shelf directly across from the door—the one marked for correspondence—was empty.

The letters were gone.

And on the floor, sprawled in a heap of limbs and cheap wool, was Elias of Tyre.

The courier lay on his back, eyes open and glassy. His mouth hung slack. His hands were curled against his chest, fingers stiff. There were no visible wounds. No blood. No signs of struggle.

Just a dead man who smelled like burnt almonds and ozone.

Cornelius stood very still.

He had seen death before. Mice in the archives. A bird that had flown into the dome and broken its neck. Once, a very old patron who had passed quietly in a reading chair, a book open on his lap.

But this was different.

This was *murder* in his library.

The violation of it settled over him like a weight. Someone had entered his sanctuary—his hoard—and stolen from it. Killed in it. Left a body on *his floor* as though the library were some back-alley market stall.

Unacceptable.

Cornelius stepped closer to the body, forcing himself to observe. Elias's tunic was the same one he had worn yesterday. The blue spiral of the courier's guild was still visible on the shoulder. His boots were scuffed. His fingernails were clean, but his palms showed fresh blisters—the kind that came from climbing or handling rough rope.

Cornelius leaned down and sniffed. The burnt almond scent was strongest near the mouth and nose. Inhaled, then. Not ingested. A poison delivered through vapor or dust.

He turned his attention to the floor. No footprints in the dust—he kept the vault meticulously clean—but there were scuff marks near the door. Someone else had been here. Someone heavier than Elias, judging by the depth of the disturbed dust.

A partner. Or the killer.

Or both.

The sound of the library's front door opening jolted him from his analysis.

"Cornelius? You here?" Zeph's voice echoed from the main room, casual and loud.

Cornelius stepped out of the vault and closed the door behind him. "Do not shout in the library."

"Sorry." Zeph appeared at the base of the stairs, already pulling off his jacket. He stopped when he saw Cornelius's expression. "Whoa. You okay? You look—"

"We have a situation." Cornelius descended from the vault platform, moving with precise, controlled steps. "You will remain calm. You will not touch anything. You will do exactly as I instruct."

Zeph's eyes widened. "What happened?"

"The Kallistos vault has been breached. Contents have been stolen. There is a body."

The boy went pale. "A *body*?"

"Elias of Tyre. The courier from yesterday." Cornelius reached the main floor and turned to face Zeph fully. "He is deceased. I believe he was poisoned during the course of the theft."

"Oh my—" Zeph pressed a hand over his mouth. "We have to get the Watch. We have to—"

"We will. But first, I need you to check the perimeter. I want to know if anyone is still in the building."

"You think the killer's *here*?"

"I think it is a possibility we must exclude." Cornelius pointed toward the eastern wing. "Check the reading rooms and the archives. Do not enter any closed spaces alone. If you see anything unusual, you will return to me immediately. Do you understand?"

Zeph nodded, his face still bloodless, but his jaw set. "Yeah. I got it."

"Good." Cornelius watched him go, then turned back to the vault.

He needed to examine the scene more thoroughly before the Watch arrived and trampled over everything with their boots and their assumptions. Captain Melas was competent, but he did not have Cornelius's eye for detail.

Or his personal investment.

Cornelius returned to the vault and forced himself to look past the body. The shelves. The walls. The ceiling. There—near the top corner, where the stone met the iron frame of the door—a thin line of soot. The kind left by a controlled burn.

He climbed the nearest shelf, balancing on a ledge, and sniffed. Definitely soot. But also... yes. Machine oil. The same scent he had detected on yesterday's package.

The package.

Cornelius jumped down and hurried to the main desk. He unlocked the vault transfer drawer and pulled it open.

Empty.

The package was gone.

Of course it was. It had never been "sentimental correspondence." It had been tools. Or keys. Or a schematic, just as he had suspected.

And Elias—nervous, sweating Elias—had delivered the means of his own death.

Cornelius slammed the drawer shut. His claws scored the wood.

Someone had planned this. Used the courier as a tool, then discarded him. The theft was clean, calculated, and utterly ruthless.

And it had happened in *his library*.

"Uh, Cornelius?" Zeph's voice drifted from the back of the building. "You're gonna want to see this."

Cornelius found him in the southern archive room, standing near the ventilation grate. The iron grill had been removed and leaned against the wall. The shaft beyond was dark and narrow.

"Someone used the vents," Zeph said. He pointed to scuff marks on the stone floor near the opening. "Look. Fresh."

Cornelius examined the marks. Boot prints. Large. Male, probably. Or a very tall woman.

He peered into the vent shaft. It ran vertically for six feet, then turned horizontal toward the main building. Too small for a human to navigate comfortably.

But possible. Barely.

"There is more," Zeph said quietly. He gestured toward the corner behind a tall bookshelf.

Cornelius followed his gaze.

A man sat slumped against the wall, half-hidden in shadow. He was older—mid-fifties, with graying hair and the soft hands of wealth. His tunic bore the spiral emblem of House Kallistos. A wine bottle lay empty beside him. In his lap, a rolled parchment.

Petros Kallistos, owner of the vault.

And he was either asleep or unconscious.

Cornelius approached slowly. "Petros."

No response.

He raised his voice. "Petros Kallistos. Wake up."

The man stirred, groaning. His eyes opened—bloodshot, unfocused. He blinked at Cornelius, then at Zeph, then down at the bottle in confusion. "Wha—?"

"You are in the Solterra Bay Library," Cornelius said. His voice was flat, controlled. "You will explain what you are doing here."

Petros rubbed his face. "I... I came to check on the vault. Last night. I heard—" He stopped, his gaze sharpening. "Is it true? Is it open?"

"It is breached. Contents have been stolen. A man is dead." Cornelius tilted his head. "And you were found in my archive room, intoxicated, with a map."

"A map?" Petros looked down at the parchment in his lap as though seeing it for the first time. He unrolled it with shaking hands.

It was a schematic. The library's ventilation system, drawn in meticulous detail.

Cornelius's eyes narrowed. "Where did you get that?"

"I... I do not know." Petros stared at it, his face pale. "I do not remember. I was at the tavern. Someone bought me drinks. We talked about the vault, about the wards. I told him they were strong. I told him..." He trailed off, horror dawning in his expression. "I told him too much."

"Who?" Cornelius demanded. "Who bought you drinks?"

"I do not know his name. Big man. Spoke with an eastern accent. He said he was interested in architecture. In warded buildings." Petros dropped the schematic. "I thought he was just curious. I did not think—"

"You did not think he was gathering intelligence for a theft." Cornelius's tail lashed. "You were manipulated. Plied with alcohol and mined for information."

"I did not mean—"

"Intent is irrelevant." Cornelius turned to Zeph. "Stay with him. Do not let him leave. I am going to summon the Watch."

He stalked toward the main entrance, fury simmering under his scales. Petros had been a fool. A drunk, careless fool who had handed a thief the keys to his own vault.

But he was not the killer.

Someone else had used that information. Someone who knew how to melt iron with magic and kill with poison.

Cornelius reached the front door and pulled it open.

Across the square, leaning against the fountain with his arms crossed, stood Captain Mago Hanno.

The orc was impossible to miss. Seven feet tall, broad-shouldered, with tusks that gleamed in the morning light. He wore the stained coat of a ship captain, and his eyes—dark and cold—were fixed directly on the library.

On Cornelius.

Their gazes met.

Mago did not move. Did not smile. Did not look away.

He simply watched.

A chill ran down Cornelius's spine.

Mago was a smuggler. Everyone knew it. He ran goods through the harbor wards during the Feast, bribed the right officials, and kept his ship clean enough to avoid prosecution. He was dangerous, clever, and utterly without scruple.

And he was watching the library the morning after a theft.

Cornelius stepped back inside and closed the door. His heart pounded against his ribs.

The theft was not random. It was not opportunistic.

It was planned. Professional.

And the man outside—watching, waiting—knew something.

Cornelius locked the door and turned back toward the vault.

His library had been violated. His sanctuary breached. A man had died on his floor, and the wards—ancient, unbreakable wards—had been bypassed as though they were nothing more than a polite suggestion.

The silence was gone.

The safety was gone.

And Cornelius stood in the center of his hoard, surrounded by books and stone and the smell of burnt almonds, and felt the world shift beneath his feet.

He had thought he could observe. Document. Wait for the crime to unfold and meet it with evidence and proof.

He had been wrong.

The crime had already happened.

And he had not been ready.

# Chapter 3

# Chapter 3

Cornelius stood guard beside the vault door while Zeph ran to fetch the Watch.

He did not enter. Did not disturb the scene further. His claws itched to examine every surface, catalog every detail, but he forced himself to wait. The Watch needed to see this exactly as he had found it—melted seal, missing letters, dead courier, fool of a vault owner slumped in the archives with his incriminating schematic.

The evidence was clear. Organized. Irrefutable.

The Watch would have to listen.

Cornelius adjusted his spectacles and peered through the doorway at Elias's body. The burnt almond scent had faded slightly, dispersing into the library's cooler air, but the ozone still clung to the iron door frame. Someone with skill had done this. Someone who understood both magic and murder.

His tail lashed once, scoring the stone floor.

Someone had turned his library into a crime scene.

The front door banged open.

"Cornelius!" Zeph's voice echoed from the main hall, followed by heavier footsteps and the jangle of official equipment.

Cornelius descended from the vault platform and moved to intercept them at the base of the stairs.

Captain Theo Melas entered first, his leather armor dusty from the Feast crowds. He was a thick-shouldered human in his forties, graying at the temples, with the flat expression of a man who had seen too many stupid problems in one lifetime. Two guards flanked him—younger, nervous, gripping their truncheons like shields.

Theo stopped when he saw Cornelius. His gaze flicked to the vault door, then back. "Where's the body?"

"Inside the Kallistos vault. Elias of Tyre, deceased approximately three to five hours ago." Cornelius gestured with one wing. "The cause of death is inhaled poison. The vault has been breached and its contents stolen. The seal was melted with focused magical heat. I have secured the scene and documented the initial findings."

Theo stared at him. "You documented the findings."

"Yes. I am the Curator. This is my library."

"This is a crime scene under the jurisdiction of the city Watch." Theo moved past him toward the stairs. "You're a librarian. Stay out of the way."

Cornelius's scales prickled. "I am the individual who discovered the breach. I identified the poison residue and the method of entry. I located the secondary suspect in the archives with relevant schematics. My observations are material to—"

"Your observations are noted." Theo climbed the stairs without looking back. "We'll take it from here."

The two guards followed, their boots striking the stone with graceless thuds.

Cornelius stood frozen at the base of the stairs, fury building like heat in his chest.

*Stay out of the way.*

As though he were a bystander. As though his century of guarding this sanctuary meant nothing. As though the violation of his hoard, the desecration of his silence, the *murder on his floor* were merely an inconvenience to be processed and filed.

Zeph appeared at his side, breathing hard. "I ran all the way to the Watch station. Are they gonna—?"

"They are going to ignore everything I tell them and ruin my evidence." Cornelius stalked toward the stairs. "Come. You will observe and remember. If Theo will not listen now, we will ensure he has no choice later."

They climbed to the vault platform. Theo stood in the doorway, examining the melted seal with one hand on his belt. The two guards hovered behind him, trying very hard not to look at the body on the floor.

Cornelius stopped beside Theo and pointed to the pooled iron at the base of the door. "The heat required to melt this metal indicates sustained magical application. Not a burst. Not an accident. Someone stood here and methodically compromised the seal." He gestured to the soot marks near the door frame. "The residue pattern suggests the use of a focusing tool. Likely delivered in the package Elias brought yesterday."

Theo glanced at him. "What package?"

"The courier delivered a wrapped parcel for vault storage. I logged it in the intake ledger. It contained powdered lapis lazuli and machine oil residue. I suspected it was not the declared 'correspondence' and placed it in the secure transfer drawer." Cornelius turned toward the main desk. "The package is now missing. It was the tool used to breach the wards."

"Lapis and oil." Theo's tone was flat. "You're telling me someone smuggled in a magic lock pick made of paint powder and grease."

"I am telling you the chemical composition was inconsistent with the declared contents. The dust and oil are reagents used in high-temperature alchemical reactions. Combined with the correct binding agent, they produce—"

"Cornelius." Theo held up one hand. "I appreciate the lecture. But we're dealing with a death here. Not a chemistry experiment."

"The death is *connected* to the chemistry." Cornelius's claws dug into the stone. "The burnt almond scent near the victim's mouth indicates a cyanide-based compound. The ozone residue indicates powerful magic. The missing package, the melted seal, the stolen correspondence—they are all parts of a coordinated theft and murder."

Theo turned back to the vault. "Or Elias tried to rob the place, got in over his head, and something went wrong. People die doing stupid things during the Feast. It's not a conspiracy. It's bad luck and poor planning."

Cornelius stared at him. "You believe this was *accidental*?"

"I believe we need a proper examination before we start declaring murder." Theo gestured to one of the guards. "Get Sister Photine. Tell her we need a death certification."

The guard fled toward the exit with visible relief.

Theo stepped into the vault, crouching beside Elias's body. He did not touch it. Did not disturb the position of the limbs. At least he had *that* much sense.

"No wounds," Theo muttered. "No blood. Face is pale. Lips are... yeah, that's a little blue." He straightened. "Could be heart failure. Could be bad air in the vault."

"The vault is ventilated," Cornelius snapped. "And the scent is not 'bad air.' It is a specific chemical marker consistent with—"

"Consistent with your theory." Theo turned to face him fully. "Look. I know you care about this place. I know you're... protective. But you're not a Watch investigator. You're a dragon who runs a library. Let us do our job."

The words landed like stones.

Cornelius went very still. His wings folded tight against his back. His tail curled around his feet.

*You're a dragon who runs a library.*

Not a guardian. Not an expert. Not a witness with valuable forensic observations.

A dragon.

Who ran a library.

And therefore had no authority. No standing. No voice in the investigation of a crime *in his own domain*.

"Cornelius?" Zeph whispered.

He did not respond. Did not move. If he moved, he would do something unwise. He would say something that would make Theo dismiss him even further. He would lose what little cooperation remained.

So he stood. And he watched. And he committed every detail to memory so that when this fool of a captain filed his inadequate report, Cornelius would have his own record. Complete. Accurate. *Correct*.

Footsteps echoed from the main hall. Lighter this time. Measured.

Sister Photine appeared at the top of the stairs, her healer's satchel slung over one shoulder. She was human, middle-aged, with the brisk efficiency of someone who dealt with blood and bone as a matter of routine. Her gray robes were clean but worn. Her hands were scrubbed pink.

She stopped when she saw the vault, her gaze sweeping the melted seal, the body, and finally Cornelius.

"Captain," she said. "You called for a certification?"

"Yeah. We've got a dead courier in the Kallistos vault. No visible trauma. The Curator thinks it's poison. I want your professional opinion."

Photine set down her satchel and approached the body with calm, practiced steps. She knelt beside Elias, her robes pooling on the stone floor.

Cornelius watched her hands. Watched where she touched.

She pressed two fingers to Elias's throat, checking for a pulse that clearly wasn't there. Then she tilted his head, examining his eyes. She peeled back one eyelid. Checked the other.

"Pupils are dilated," she murmured. "Consistent with oxygen deprivation or neurological distress."

She moved to his mouth, prying it open with impersonal efficiency. Looked inside. Sniffed.

"There is a faint almond scent," she said. "But that could be from food. Some nuts produce similar oils."

Cornelius's claws scored the floor. "It is not *food*. It is—"

"Let her work," Theo said.

Photine ignored them both. She unbuttoned Elias's tunic and pressed her palm against his chest. Listened. Felt the ribs. Then she rolled up his sleeves and examined his forearms and hands.

Her fingers paused over the blisters on Elias's palms—the ones Cornelius had noted earlier.

"Rope burns," Photine said. "Fresh. He was climbing or hauling something heavy."

"Consistent with using the ventilation system," Cornelius said. He pointed toward the archives. "There is evidence of—"

"I'll get to that." Theo waved him off.

Photine turned Elias's hands over, examining the backs of his fingers. Then she checked his wrists. His neck. She pulled his collar aside and studied the skin below his jaw.

She was looking for something specific.

Cornelius tilted his head, watching. Her movements were methodical. Professional. But there was a precision to it that felt less like a general examination and more like confirmation.

She knew what she was looking for.

And she was checking to see if she found it.

Photine straightened, brushing her hands on her robes. "No visible splotches. No swelling. Skin tone is pale but not discolored beyond expected post-mortem settling."

She was narrating for Theo's benefit. Recording details.

But the specific mention of *splotches*—the careful examination of the skin for reactions—suggested she was ruling out a specific cause.

Or confirming its absence.

Cornelius stepped closer. "What kind of splotches?"

Photine glanced at him. "Some poisons cause subcutaneous hemorrhaging. Visible marks. This body does not show those signs."

"But other poisons do not," Cornelius said. "Cyanide compounds, for example, do not produce external marks. They cause rapid oxygen deprivation, dilated pupils, and the scent of burnt almonds—all of which are present."

"Cyanide is an exotic substance." Photine stood, collecting her satchel. "It requires specific knowledge and preparation. The more likely explanation is heart failure brought on by exertion and stress."

"He was *murdered*," Cornelius said. His voice cracked with frustration. "The evidence—"

"The evidence is circumstantial." Theo crossed his arms. "What's your ruling, Sister?"

Photine wiped her hands on a cloth from her satchel. As she turned, her robe shifted, and the hem of her sandal caught the amber light from the dome.

Cornelius saw it.

A thread. Blue. Bright against the worn leather.

The same shade as the mended hem on Sophia Doukas's dress.

His breath stopped.

The thread was fresh. Clean. Not frayed or faded. It had been placed recently—snagged, perhaps, in the last day or two.

In a place where blue tile-maker's thread might be found.

Like the Doukas workshop.

Or Sophia Doukas's home.

Cornelius's mind raced. Photine had been in contact with Sophia. Or somewhere Sophia had been. Recently enough that the thread remained intact.

He opened his mouth to speak.

"Natural causes," Photine said. She closed her satchel with a firm snap. "Heart failure, most likely stress-induced. I'll file the certification with the Healer's Hall this afternoon."

"Natural causes," Theo repeated. He looked at Cornelius. "See? No conspiracy. Just a man who pushed himself too hard."

"That is *incorrect*." Cornelius's wings flared. "The chemical signatures, the melted seal, the missing package and correspondence—none of that is explained by heart failure. This was a planned theft. Elias was killed to silence him. The evidence is—"

"The evidence is being reviewed by trained officials." Theo's voice hardened. "You've done your part, Cornelius. You found the body. You reported it. But this is Watch business now. You need to step back."

"This is *my library*." Cornelius's voice shook with suppressed fury. "The crime occurred in *my vault*. The victim delivered a suspicious package *to me*. I have documented every relevant detail, and you are ignoring all of it because you would rather close the case quickly than investigate properly."

Theo's jaw tightened. "Watch your tone."

"I will not. You are wrong. Sister Photine is wrong. And if you proceed with this ruling, you will allow a murderer to walk free while the city believes a man died of natural causes in a locked, warded vault that was breached with professional skill and magical tools." Cornelius stepped forward, claws scoring the stone. "I will not allow it."

"You don't have a choice." Theo gestured to the guards. "Seal the vault. No one goes in or out until we've cleared the body and logged the scene."

One of the guards produced a heavy iron chain and began threading it through the door handle.

"You cannot seal the vault," Cornelius said. "It is Kallistos property. I am the Curator. I hold the access key."

"Not anymore." Theo held out his hand. "Give me the key."

Cornelius stared at him. "No."

"Cornelius. Give me the key, or I will cite you for obstruction."

"You cannot cite me for refusing to surrender property I am legally bound to protect."

"The vault is a crime scene. That overrides your custodial rights." Theo's voice was flat. Final. "Key. Now."

They stood facing each other on the platform, the vault door between them like a wall. The guards watched, tense. Photine stood to one side, silent.

Zeph shifted nervously. "Cornelius..."

The boy was right. Cornelius knew he was right.

If he refused, Theo would have him removed. Possibly arrested. And then he would have *no* access to the investigation. No ability to observe, document, or correct the Watch's failures.

But if he surrendered the key, he lost his last claim to authority over his own domain.

His hoard had been violated. His sanctuary breached.

And now he was being forced to hand it over to a man who could not—or would not—see the truth.

Slowly, Cornelius reached into the small pouch at his side and withdrew the vault key. It was old iron, heavy, warm from resting against his scales.

He held it for one long moment.

Then he placed it in Theo's palm.

"Documented," he said quietly. "I am surrendering this key under protest. I formally object to the ruling of natural causes. I formally request a full investigation into the theft of Kallistos correspondence and the death of Elias of Tyre."

"Noted." Theo pocketed the key. "Now step back. We'll handle the rest."

Cornelius turned and descended the stairs.

Zeph followed, silent.

Behind them, the guards finished chaining the vault door. The iron links rattled. The lock clicked.

Cornelius reached the main floor and stopped beside his desk. His claws rested on the wood. His tail lay flat and still.

He had done everything correctly.

He had observed. Documented. Reported.

He had presented evidence. Made logical deductions. Followed procedure.

And he had been dismissed.

Ignored.

Locked out of his own vault.

"Cornelius?" Zeph's voice was small. Uncertain.

"Begin the afternoon opening procedures," Cornelius said. His voice was calm. Controlled. Empty. "The reading tables require inspection. The History section needs re-shelving."

"But—"

"We have work to do."

Zeph hesitated. Then he nodded and moved toward the storage room.

Cornelius stood alone in the center of the library.

Above him, the amber light from the dome filtered down through colored glass. The shelves stood silent and ordered. The books waited, patient and still.

Everything was in its place.

Except the murder was being buried. The thief was walking free. And the only people who seemed to care were a dragon with no legal standing and a sixteen-year-old intern with flour on his shoes.

Cornelius's claws dug into the wood of his desk.

He had been ready for a thief.

He had not been ready for the Watch to be more dangerous than the criminal.

But he was ready now.

He pulled out his private ledger and opened it to a new page.

*Spring Feast, Day Two,* he wrote. *Incident Log, Continued.*

*10:00 — Captain Theo Melas arrives. Dismisses forensic evidence. Declares death accidental.*

*10:20 — Sister Photine certifies "natural causes." Noted: Blue thread on sandal. Match to Sophia Doukas (Chapter 1). Photine examined body for specific skin reactions (splotches). Suggests prior knowledge of expected poison type.*

*10:30 — Vault sealed. Key confiscated. Access denied.*

*Conclusion: Official investigation is compromised or incompetent. Proceed independently.*

He set down his pen.

The Watch had the legal authority.

But Cornelius had the truth.

And he would prove it.

Even if he had to do it alone.

# Chapter 4

The rafters smelled of dust and old wood and failure.

Cornelius lay curled on the broad beam that ran the length of the library's western wall, his tail wrapped around his body, his wings folded tight. Below, the main floor stretched empty and silent. The amber light from the dome cast long shadows across the shelves. The reading tables waited, clean and unused.

No patrons had come today.

Word had spread. *Body in the library. Death in the vault. Not safe.*

Cornelius had heard the whispers from the street when he had unlocked the door that morning. A cluster of women at the fountain, glancing toward the entrance and shaking their heads. A merchant pulling his cart away from the square with a deliberate detour.

The library—*his* library—had been marked as unsafe.

And he could do nothing about it.

*You are a dragon who runs a library.*

Theo's voice echoed in his mind for the hundredth time. Flat. Dismissive. Final.

Not a guardian. Not an investigator. Not even a credible witness.

Just a dragon.

Who ran a library.

Cornelius's claws dug into the wood of the beam. The sound was soft, controlled. He would not scar his own rafters with temper. He would not lose composure simply because the entire city Watch had decided his century of service meant less than a healer's three-minute examination and a captain's need for a tidy report.

He had done everything correctly.

He had observed, documented, presented evidence with clarity and precision. He had identified the melted seal, the chemical residue, the burnt almond scent of cyanide. He had connected the missing package to the theft, noted the rope burns on Elias's hands, traced the ventilation access route.

And he had been dismissed.

Worse—he had been *locked out*.

The vault below was chained shut. His key sat in Theo's pocket. The crime scene was being processed by guards who could not tell lapis dust from lamp oil.

Cornelius closed his eyes and pressed his snout against the beam.

The library was supposed to be his sanctuary. His hoard. The one place in the world where order prevailed and chaos remained outside the door.

But chaos had entered.

It had melted his wards, stolen his contents, left a body on his floor.

And when he had tried to respond—when he had tried to *protect*—he had been told to step aside.

Useless.

He was useless.

The thought settled over him like cold stone.

Footsteps sounded on the main floor. Light. Familiar.

"Cornelius?" Zeph's voice drifted up from below. "You still up there?"

Cornelius did not answer.

The footsteps moved toward the spiral stair that led to the rafter access platform. The boy was coming up.

Of course he was.

Zeph did not understand the concept of *leaving someone alone*.

The stairs creaked. A moment later, Zeph's head appeared at the platform edge, his dark hair catching the amber light. He spotted Cornelius and climbed the rest of the way, stepping carefully onto the beam walk.

"Hey," Zeph said. He carried something wrapped in cloth. "Brought you something."

Cornelius opened one eye. "I am not hungry."

"It's not food." Zeph crouched on the beam with the balance of someone who had clearly done this before without permission. He unwrapped the cloth.

Fresh mint. A full bundle, bright green and fragrant.

The scent reached Cornelius immediately—clean, sharp, soothing. Nothing like ozone. Nothing like burnt almonds.

Just mint.

Cornelius lifted his head slightly. "Where did you get that?"

"The herb seller. The one from the Feast market." Zeph set the bundle on the beam between them. "I remembered you liked this kind. The, uh... the curly-leaf one."

"Spearmint," Cornelius corrected automatically. He stared at the bundle. It was a generous amount. Expensive, especially during the Feast when prices doubled. "You purchased this?"

"Yeah." Zeph shrugged, looking away. "Figured you could use it. You know. After... everything."

Cornelius sat up slowly. His tail unwound. His wings shifted, settling into a more comfortable position.

Zeph had bought him mint.

With his own money.

As a... what? An apology? A gesture of solidarity?

A peace offering.

Cornelius reached out and pulled a sprig free from the bundle. He chewed it slowly, letting the flavor settle over his tongue. The sharpness cleared his head. The coolness eased the tightness in his chest.

"Thank you," he said quietly.

Zeph blinked. "Uh. You're welcome?"

They sat in silence for a moment. Below, the library remained still. The shelves stood like sentinels. The vault door—chained and locked—was just visible from this angle, a dark iron wound in the western wall.

"This sucks," Zeph said finally.

Cornelius huffed. "That is an understatement."

"Yeah, well." Zeph picked at the edge of the beam. "I don't have fancy words for it. This just... sucks. You were right. About everything. And they didn't listen."

"No. They did not."

"So what do we do?"

Cornelius glanced at him. "We?"

"Yeah. We." Zeph met his eyes. "You think I'm just gonna go back to shelving books while some murderer walks around free? After they killed a guy in *our* library?"

*Our* library.

The boy had said *our*.

Cornelius looked away, chewing another sprig of mint. His chest felt strange. Tight, but not unpleasantly so.

"I do not know what we do," he admitted. The words came out softer than he intended. "I have documented the evidence. I have filed a formal protest. I have done everything within my authority. And it was not enough."

"Because Theo's an idiot."

"Because I am a dragon who runs a library." Cornelius's claws scraped the wood. "Not a Watch investigator. Not a legal authority. I have no standing. No jurisdiction. No power to compel action."

"That's bureaucratic garbage," Zeph said flatly.

"Perhaps. But it is also reality." Cornelius's tail curled around his feet. "I thought... I believed that evidence and logic would be sufficient. That clarity of observation would matter. But it does not. Not when set against institutional convenience."

"So they're just gonna let it go? Call it natural causes and move on?"

"It would appear so."

"That's—" Zeph stopped. His hands curled into fists. "That's not fair."

"No. It is not."

They sat together on the beam, the bundle of mint between them, and stared down at the library floor.

Cornelius had not expected to feel this. This sense of... companionship. Shared frustration. The boy was sixteen, irreverent, chronically messy, and prone to smuggling pastries into sacred spaces.

But he was here.

And he cared.

"I was scared," Zeph said suddenly. His voice was small. "When you told me about the body. I was really scared."

Cornelius turned to look at him.

Zeph was staring at his hands. "I kept thinking... what if the killer was still here? What if they came back? What if—" He stopped. Swallowed. "I didn't want you to know. Because you're always so... sure. About everything. And I didn't want to look like a coward."

"Fear is not cowardice," Cornelius said. "Fear is rational assessment of danger. You were correct to be frightened. Someone committed murder in this building. That is objectively terrifying."

"Yeah, but you weren't scared."

"I was." The admission surprised Cornelius even as he said it. But it was true. "I *am*. Not of physical harm. But of... failing to protect this place. Of being powerless to stop what has already begun." He looked down at the vault door. "I have spent a century building this sanctuary. And in one night, someone violated it. And I could not stop them."

Zeph was quiet for a long moment.

Then he said, "You didn't fail."

"I did not succeed."

"You *noticed*." Zeph's voice was firm. "You saw all the stuff Theo missed. You figured out the poison, the melted seal, the missing package. You connected the dots. That's not failing. That's... that's being smart."

"Intelligence without authority is merely observation." Cornelius pulled another sprig of mint from the bundle. "I can see the crime. I simply cannot solve it."

"Not alone, maybe." Zeph shifted on the beam. "But you've got me. And we've got all your notes. And the library's still here. So... I don't know. Maybe we just keep looking. Keep watching. Until we find something Theo *can't* ignore."

Cornelius considered this.

The boy was not wrong.

He had evidence. He had observations. He had a detailed incident log documenting every suspicious detail from Elias's arrival to Photine's questionable ruling.

And he had a sixteen-year-old intern who apparently considered himself part of an investigative team.

It was not much.

But it was more than he'd had an hour ago.

"Very well," Cornelius said. He sat up straighter, adjusting his spectacles. "We will proceed independently. Quietly. We will observe, document, and wait for the conspirators to make a mistake."

"Yeah?" Zeph's face brightened. "We're doing this?"

"We are doing *something*." Cornelius folded his wings. "Though I am not yet certain what."

A sound echoed from below. A knock. Sharp and impatient.

Not the front door.

The rear delivery entrance.

Cornelius and Zeph looked at each other.

"You expecting a delivery?" Zeph asked.

"No." Cornelius rose to his feet and moved along the beam toward the access platform. "The library is closed. No one should be using that entrance."

The knock came again. Louder.

Cornelius descended the spiral stair with Zeph close behind. They crossed the main floor and moved through the staff corridor toward the back of the building.

The delivery entrance was a small, iron-banded door set into the western wall. It opened onto a narrow alley used by couriers and suppliers. Cornelius had reinforced the lock himself three years ago.

He approached the door and called through it. "The library is closed. Return tomorrow during operating hours."

"I am not here for the library." The voice was female. Older. Sharp-edged with impatience. "I am here for my package. Eudora of Naxos. I sent correspondence for the Kallistos vault two days ago. I need it back."

Cornelius stopped.

Eudora of Naxos.

The name on the intake form. The sender of the package Elias had delivered.

The package that was now missing.

He glanced at Zeph. The boy's eyes were wide.

Cornelius unlocked the door and opened it just wide enough to see out.

A woman stood in the alley. She was human, perhaps sixty, with gray hair pinned severely back and the kind of posture that suggested a lifetime of giving orders. Her dress was fine linen, dyed deep red. Her hands were bare, and her fingers bore ink stains.

A clerk. Or a merchant. Someone who worked with ledgers.

"Curator." She inclined her head in a perfunctory nod. "I sent a package via courier. Elias of Tyre. It was to be stored in the Kallistos vault for retrieval during the Feast. I require it now."

Cornelius studied her. No grief in her expression. No concern. Just irritation at the inconvenience.

"You hired Elias to deliver the package?" he asked.

"Yes. Through the courier's guild. Standard contract." Eudora's eyes narrowed. "Why? Is there a problem?"

"Elias of Tyre is dead."

The words landed flat and cold in the alley.

Eudora went still. Her expression did not change. "Dead."

"Yes. He was found in the Kallistos vault yesterday morning. The Watch has ruled it natural causes, though the circumstances remain under investigation."

"I see." Eudora's gaze flicked past Cornelius toward the interior of the library, as though she could see through the walls to the vault itself. "And my package?"

Cornelius stared at her.

A man had died.

A courier she had hired.

And her first question—her *only* question—was about her package.

"The package is missing," he said. "It was stolen during the breach of the vault."

"Stolen." Eudora's face tightened. "You allowed it to be stolen."

"I allowed nothing. The vault was breached by unknown parties using sophisticated magical tools. The contents were taken. The Watch has sealed the vault as a crime scene."

"Then you will need to retrieve my property from the Watch." Eudora's voice was ice. "I paid the storage fee. I contracted the courier. The library's failure to secure my goods is not my concern."

Behind Cornelius, Zeph made a small, incredulous sound.

Cornelius's claws dug into the door frame. "A man is *dead*."

"Yes. You mentioned that." Eudora pulled a folded parchment from her belt pouch and held it out. "Here is my receipt. I expect compensation for the lost package, or its immediate return, whichever is faster. You may send word to my office in the north quarter when the matter is resolved."

She turned to leave.

Cornelius stepped through the doorway. "What was in the package?"

Eudora stopped. She did not turn around. "That is private."

"A crime has been committed. A theft and a death. The contents of your package may be material evidence."

"Then the Watch may ask me." Eudora glanced back over her shoulder. "I do not answer to librarians."

She walked toward the mouth of the alley.

And stopped.

A figure stepped into view, blocking her path.

Alexandros Doukas.

Cornelius recognized him immediately. Tall, broad-shouldered, with the kind of controlled stillness that spoke of physical confidence. He wore a dark blue tunic embroidered with the spiral pattern of House Doukas. His hair was black, shot through with silver. His face was handsome in a cold, precise way.

And his hands were covered.

Heavy leather gloves. Despite the warmth of the evening.

"Eudora." Alexandros's voice was smooth. Solicitous. "I heard you were inquiring about storage arrangements. May I be of assistance?"

Eudora's expression shifted. The ice melted slightly, replaced by something almost like relief. "Alexandros. Yes. There has been... an incident. My package was stolen from the Kallistos vault."

"How unfortunate." Alexandros moved toward her with the fluid grace of someone used to command. "You must be quite distressed. Please. Allow me to escort you home. We can discuss the matter privately."

"I need to recover my property."

"Of course. And I will help you do so." Alexandros placed one gloved hand on her shoulder. The gesture was gentle. Paternal. "But the library is in disarray at present. The Watch is involved. It would be best to let the officials handle the matter and pursue restitution through proper channels."

He was steering her. Physically turning her away from the library. Away from Cornelius.

"I just want my package," Eudora said. Her voice had lost its edge. She sounded tired. Uncertain.

"I know." Alexandros guided her toward the alley mouth. "Come. Let us speak somewhere more comfortable."

They walked away together, Alexandros's gloved hand still resting on Eudora's shoulder.

Cornelius watched them go.

The gloves.

Heavy leather. Fitted. Not work gloves. Not riding gloves.

Gloves worn to hide something.

Scars. Burns. Stains.

Or the residue of alchemical work.

Alexandros glanced back just before they turned the corner. His gaze met Cornelius's. For one brief moment, something cold and sharp flickered in his expression.

Then he smiled. Polite. Empty.

And they were gone.

Cornelius stood in the alley for a long moment, the receipt still in his claw.

Behind him, Zeph let out a breath. "Okay. That was weird."

"Yes."

"She didn't even care that Elias was dead."

"No. She did not."

"And Alexandros just... showed up. Like he was waiting." Zeph moved to stand beside Cornelius, staring at the empty alley. "That's suspicious, right? That's not just me?"

"It is not just you." Cornelius turned the receipt over in his claws. The handwriting was precise. The wax seal bore the mark of a Naxos merchant house. Legitimate, on the surface.

But the reaction had been wrong.

Grief, shock, fear—those were normal responses to the news of a hired courier's death.

Eudora had shown none of them.

She had shown only frustration at an inconvenience.

And Alexandros had appeared at exactly the right moment to intercept her. To control the conversation. To steer her away before Cornelius could ask further questions.

Wearing gloves that hid his hands.

Cornelius folded the receipt and slipped it into his pouch.

"We are adding Eudora of Naxos to the list," he said.

"List of what?"

"Suspects. Witnesses. Individuals who bear further observation." Cornelius turned back toward the library. "She hired Elias. She sent the package. And her response to his death was concern for her property, not the man."

"You think she's involved?"

"I think she knows more than she is saying." Cornelius locked the delivery door behind them and moved back through the corridor. "And I think Alexandros Doukas did not want her saying it to me."

They returned to the main floor. The amber light from the dome had deepened, casting long shadows across the shelves. The library felt larger in the quiet. Emptier.

But not abandoned.

Zeph was still here. The mint was still fresh. The ledger was still waiting.

And Cornelius was no longer sitting uselessly in the rafters.

He moved to his desk and pulled out his private incident log.

*Spring Feast, Day Two. Evening.*

*Visitor: Eudora of Naxos. Sender of the stolen package. Claims it contained private correspondence. Showed no grief or concern for Elias's death. Primary concern: recovery of property.*

*Observation: Alexandros Doukas intercepted her in the alley. Wore heavy gloves despite warm evening. Steered conversation away from the library and further inquiry.*

*Hypothesis: Eudora may be connected to the theft. Alexandros may be protecting her—or protecting someone else's interests.*

*Conclusion: Surveillance of House Doukas is warranted.*

He set down his pen.

Zeph leaned over his shoulder, reading. "You really think Alexandros is part of this?"

"I think he is connected." Cornelius tapped the page. "His sister Sophia was seen arguing with Elias the day before the theft. A blue thread matching her dress was found on Sister Photine's sandal. And now Alexandros appears precisely when Eudora attempts to reclaim stolen property."

"That's... a lot of Doukas."

"Yes. It is." Cornelius closed the ledger. "Which suggests either a family conspiracy or a very unfortunate series of coincidences."

"You don't believe in coincidences."

"No. I do not."

Cornelius looked toward the chained vault door. The iron links gleamed dully in the amber light. The lock hung heavy and final.

Theo had the key. The Watch controlled the scene. The official investigation had been closed with a ruling of natural causes.

But Cornelius had his own investigation now.

Quiet. Methodical. Built on observation and documentation.

And he was no longer conducting it alone.

He glanced at Zeph. The boy was staring at the vault with the same expression Cornelius imagined he himself wore—determination mixed with lingering fear.

"We will need to be careful," Cornelius said.

"Yeah. I figured."

"If the conspirators realize we are investigating, we become targets."

"I know."

"You may withdraw from this endeavor at any time. I will not think less of you."

Zeph looked at him. "You're not getting rid of me that easy."

Cornelius felt something in his chest shift. Warm. Unfamiliar.

Not unpleasant.

"Very well," he said. "Then we proceed together."

The library settled into evening quiet around them. The shelves stood witness. The books waited, patient and still.

And somewhere in the city beyond, a killer walked free.

But Cornelius was watching now.

And he would not stop until the truth was written in ink, documented in ledgers, and impossible to ignore.

Even if he had to build the case one careful observation at a time.

# Chapter 5

# Chapter 5

The library was dark.

Cornelius preferred it that way.

He had extinguished the reading lamps an hour ago and locked the front door with the iron bar usually reserved for storm season. The amber light from the dome above had dimmed to a glow barely brighter than coals. Outside, the Spring Feast roared on—drums, laughter, the crash of something heavy hitting cobblestones.

Inside, silence.

Almost.

Cornelius's claws clicked against stone as he paced the length of the main floor. Back and forth. Circulation desk to the History section. History section to the chained vault door. Vault door back to the desk.

His tail lashed with each turn.

*You are a dragon who runs a library.*

Theo's words circled his mind like carrion birds. Dismissive. Final. As though a century of guardianship meant nothing. As though Cornelius's detailed observations, his forensic deductions, his *correct assessment of a murder* could be waved away because he did not wear the armor of the Watch.

He stopped beside his desk and stared at the private ledger lying open in the amber glow.

*Official investigation is compromised or incompetent. Proceed independently.*

He had written that.

But what did "proceed independently" actually mean?

Observe? He had done that. Document? His ledger was full of documentation. Report findings? To whom? Theo had made his position clear. Sister Photine had certified natural causes. The vault was sealed. The case was closed.

And a murderer walked free.

Cornelius's claws dug into the wood of his desk. The grain splintered slightly under the pressure.

Unacceptable.

Someone had violated his sanctuary. Melted his wards. Stolen correspondence. Left a body on his floor.

And the official response was to chain the door, pocket the key, and tell him to *stay out of the way*.

His wings flared.

No.

He would not stay out of the way.

If the Watch would not pursue justice, then he would have to define it himself.

Cornelius moved to the supply cabinet and retrieved a blank ledger sheet, a stick of charcoal, and his sharpest quill. He carried them back to the desk and spread the parchment flat.

At the top, he wrote in careful script: *Suspects and Connections.*

Then he began.

*Sophia Doukas.* He printed her name in block letters on the left side of the page. Beneath it, he listed what he knew:

- Argued with Elias (Day 1, market square).
- Discussed "wards," "sequence," and withheld payment.
- Blue thread from her clothing found on Sister Photine's sandal.

Cornelius drew a line connecting Sophia's name to a second entry: *Sister Photine.*

- Certified "natural causes" despite evidence of poison.
- Checked for specific skin reactions (prior knowledge of toxin type?).
- Recent contact with Sophia or Doukas workshop (blue thread).

A third line extended to *Alexandros Doukas.*

- Intercepted Eudora in the alley (Day 2, evening).
- Wore heavy gloves in warm weather (concealing residue? burns?).
- Steered conversation away from further inquiry.

Cornelius tapped the quill against his snout, thinking.

The Doukas family was everywhere in this. Three separate individuals, three separate encounters, all connected to the theft or its aftermath.

He added a fourth name to the right side of the page: *Eudora of Naxos.*

- Sender of the stolen package.
- Hired Elias as courier.
- Showed no grief for his death; prioritized property recovery.
- Contents of package unknown (declared private).

And then, reluctantly, a fifth: *Petros Kallistos.*

- Vault owner.
- Found drunk in archives with ventilation schematic.
- Admitted discussing vault wards with a stranger at a tavern.
- Description of stranger: large, eastern-accented man.

Cornelius paused. The "large, eastern-accented man" did not yet have a name, but he had a likely candidate.

He added a sixth entry at the top of the page: *Captain Mago Hanno.*

- Orc smuggler.
- Observed watching the library the morning after the crime.
- Known for trafficking in restricted goods.

Cornelius sat back and studied the web of names and lines.

Six people.

Six threads that might connect to the same crime—or to different crimes that overlapped in his library like badly shelved volumes.

But which one had wielded the poison? Which one had stolen the correspondence?

And, most importantly, *why*?

Footsteps sounded on the stairs behind him.

Cornelius turned.

Zeph descended from the archive level, carrying a folded blanket and a waterskin. He stopped when he saw the parchment spread across Cornelius's desk.

"You're making a list," Zeph said.

"I am creating a case structure." Cornelius gestured to the page. "The official investigation may have concluded, but the actual crime remains unsolved. Therefore, I am cataloging all known variables."

Zeph set the blanket on a nearby chair and moved closer. His gaze tracked the names and lines. "That's... a lot of people."

"Six confirmed points of interest. Multiple intersections. Insufficient data to determine primacy." Cornelius tapped Sophia's name. "But this one is the most direct connection to the victim. She argued with Elias the day before his death. She referenced the wards and a 'task.' And she is linked to both Photine and Alexandros."

"So she's the one who planned it?"

"Possibly. Or she is part of a coordinated effort." Cornelius drew another line, this time connecting Eudora to the stolen package. "Eudora sent the package. Elias delivered it. Sophia hired Elias—or pressured him—to complete a 'task' involving the wards. The package likely contained the tool used to breach the seal."

"And Mago?" Zeph pointed to the smuggler's name.

"Unknown." Cornelius's tail curled in frustration. "He was present the morning after, watching the library. He fits Petros's description of the man at the tavern. But I have no direct evidence linking him to the theft itself."

Zeph leaned against the desk, arms crossed. "So what do we do? We can't just walk up to all six of them and ask if they're murderers."

"No. We cannot." Cornelius folded his wings. "But we can observe. We can follow the threads and see where they lead."

"You mean spy on them."

"I mean conduct surveillance and gather corroborating evidence." Cornelius adjusted his spectacles. "If we can establish a clear chain of action—who hired whom, who supplied what, who stood to gain—we can reconstruct the crime and identify the primary actor."

"And then what? Give it to Theo?"

Cornelius's claws scored the wood again.

That was the question, was it not?

Even if he built an airtight case, even if he documented every connection and presented it on a silver platter, would Theo listen? Or would he dismiss it again as the over-reaching of "a dragon who runs a library"?

Cornelius looked down at his ledger. At the careful script and precise lines. At the *Inventory of Truth* he had been building since the first moment Elias had walked through the door with his suspicious package.

Truth mattered.

Evidence mattered.

And if the institutions of the city would not defend them, then he would.

"Then we will present it to someone who cannot ignore it," Cornelius said. His voice was steady. Resolved. "The Council. The Healer's Hall. The families involved. We will make the truth so clear, so thoroughly documented, that dismissing it becomes impossible."

Zeph studied him. "You're really doing this. Going full vigilante librarian."

"I am pursuing justice within the boundaries of observation and documentation. That is not vigilantism. That is scholarship."

"Pretty sure Theo's not gonna see it that way."

"Captain Melas has already demonstrated his position." Cornelius turned back to the parchment. "He believes I should 'stay out of the way.' I intend to do so. Quietly. While conducting my own inquiry parallel to his closed case."

"And if the murderer figures out we're investigating?"

Cornelius met Zeph's eyes. "Then we become targets. I acknowledged that risk yesterday. It has not changed."

"Yeah, but yesterday was theoretical." Zeph's voice was quieter now. "Today you're drawing maps and planning to follow people. That's... real."

"Yes. It is." Cornelius folded his wings tighter. "You may still withdraw. I will not—"

"I'm not withdrawing." Zeph straightened. "I'm just making sure you know what you're getting into. Because once we start this, we can't just stop if it gets scary."

"I am aware."

"And you're still doing it?"

Cornelius looked at the vault door. The iron chains gleamed dully in the amber light. Beyond it, the Spring Feast noise rose and fell like tide—chaotic, uncontrolled, indifferent to his sanctuary.

Someone had brought that chaos inside.

Had melted his wards. Poisoned a man. Stolen what was meant to be protected.

And then the system—the Law, the Watch, the institutions he had believed in—had failed to respond.

He could accept many things. Disorder in the square. Noise during the Feast. Even the occasional patron who dog-eared pages.

But he could not accept a murderer walking free because it was *inconvenient* to investigate properly.

"Yes," Cornelius said. "I am still doing it."

Zeph nodded slowly. "Okay. Then where do we start?"

Cornelius turned back to the parchment and tapped Sophia's name.

"The woman who argued with the dead man," he said. "She is the clearest connection to the crime. She knew the victim. She referenced the wards. She is part of a family with means, motive, and access to alchemical materials." He drew a circle around her name. "We start with Sophia Doukas."

"And do what? Follow her around?"

"Observe her habits. Note her associations. Determine where she goes and whom she meets." Cornelius pulled out a fresh sheet of parchment. "If she orchestrated the theft, she will need to move the stolen correspondence. Sell it. Deliver it. Use it for leverage. That action will require contact with others—a buyer, a client, an accomplice."

"And when she does, we see who it is."

"Precisely." Cornelius began writing a new list: *Observational Objectives—Sophia Doukas.*

- Confirm daily routine (workshop, home, market).
- Identify known associates beyond family.
- Monitor for hand-offs, payments, or suspicious meetings.
- Note any alchemical materials or tools in her possession.

"We will need to be subtle," Cornelius said. "She must not know she is being watched. If she becomes aware, she will alter her behavior or warn her co-conspirators."

Zeph leaned over the page, reading. "You want me to tail a tile-maker through the Feast crowds without her noticing."

"I want *us* to conduct coordinated observation. You will move through the market as a normal patron. I will use elevated vantage points—rooftops, archways—to track her from above." Cornelius tapped the parchment. "We will establish a rotation. Maintain distance. Communicate via pre-arranged signals."

"Signals."

"Yes. If you spot her engaging in suspicious activity, you will... I do not know. Adjust your cap. Tie your shoe. Some innocuous gesture I can observe from a distance."

Zeph stared at him. "You've really thought about this."

"I have been thinking about little else since Theo took my key." Cornelius's claws drummed the desk. "I cannot reclaim the vault. I cannot compel the Watch to reopen the case. But I can observe. I can document. I can build a record that will eventually force action."

"Eventually."

"Justice does not happen instantly. It is a process. A careful accumulation of evidence." Cornelius gestured to his ledger. "I have the beginning here. Now I need the middle. The connections. The proof that turns suspicion into certainty."

Zeph was quiet for a moment. Then he said, "You really think Sophia did it? Personally?"

Cornelius considered the question.

"I think Sophia hired Elias to deliver the tool used to breach the vault. I think she knows who melted the seal and stole the correspondence. Whether she wielded the poison herself..." He paused. "That remains unclear. But she is complicit. And complicity is enough to start."

Zeph nodded. He pulled the blanket off the chair and draped it over his shoulders like a cape. "Okay. So when do we start?"

"Tomorrow. First light." Cornelius began rolling up the parchment. "The Doukas workshop opens early. We will position ourselves in the market before she leaves her home and maintain observation throughout the day."

"All day?"

"As long as necessary."

"What about the library?"

Cornelius stopped. His claws hovered over the parchment.

The library.

His sanctuary. His responsibility.

He had not opened the doors today. Had not allowed patrons in. The building had sat dark and silent while he brooded in the rafters and drafted case notes.

Could he abandon it again tomorrow?

Could he leave it unguarded while he pursued a thief through the Feast crowds?

His tail curled tight.

The library was his hoard. His purpose.

But what good was guarding an empty building when the crime that had violated it went unpunished?

"We will lock it," Cornelius said. His voice was firm. "Post a notice. 'Closed for Inventory.'"

"People are gonna talk."

"People are already talking. They believe the library is unsafe. Let them think I am conducting emergency inspections to restore security." Cornelius finished rolling the parchment and tucked it into his desk drawer. "One day. Two at most. Then we return, and I reopen with full safety certification."

Zeph adjusted the blanket-cape. "And if we don't find anything in two days?"

"Then we expand our search." Cornelius pulled out the full suspect list again. "We move to the next name. And the next. Until we find the thread that unravels the entire conspiracy."

"Or until the murderer finds us."

"That is also a possibility."

Zeph grinned. It was a nervous grin, but genuine. "You're kind of terrifying when you commit to something."

"I am a dragon." Cornelius adjusted his spectacles. "Terrifying is part of the contract."

Zeph laughed. The sound echoed in the dark library, bright and almost reckless.

Cornelius felt something shift in his chest again. That strange warmth he had experienced yesterday when Zeph had brought him mint. When the boy had said *our library*.

This was not just about reclaiming his sanctuary anymore.

It was about proving that truth mattered. That evidence mattered. That a dragon who ran a library could still be a dragon who *defended* it.

Even if he had to do so from the shadows.

Cornelius closed the ledger and moved toward the supply room. "Go home. Sleep. Bring practical clothes tomorrow—something that does not stand out in the market. And eat beforehand. We may be watching for hours."

"Yes, sir." Zeph gave a mock salute, then paused. "Hey, Cornelius?"

"Yes?"

"Thanks. For letting me help."

Cornelius looked at him. The boy was wrapped in a blanket, grinning like this was an adventure instead of a crime investigation. Sixteen years old and willing to chase a murderer through the Feast crowds because he believed his librarian boss was right.

Foolish.

Loyal.

Brave.

"You are welcome," Cornelius said quietly.

Zeph nodded and headed for the front door. He unlocked the iron bar, slipped out into the noise and chaos of the Feast, and pulled it shut behind him.

Cornelius stood alone in the dark library once more.

The amber light from the dome had faded to almost nothing. The shelves rose like walls around him. The chained vault door sat silent and accusing.

He could still feel the prickle at the base of his wings. The hoard-threat instinct that had warned him two days ago.

But it was different now.

Before, it had been a warning of danger approaching.

Now, it was a call to action.

Cornelius returned to his desk and retrieved the parchment with the suspect web. He studied it one more time, committing the names and connections to memory.

Sophia Doukas.

Sister Photine.

Alexandros Doukas.

Eudora of Naxos.

Petros Kallistos.

Mago Hanno.

Six threads.

One crime.

And a dragon with something to prove.

He folded the parchment carefully and placed it inside his private ledger. Then he locked the ledger in the desk drawer and pocketed the key.

Tomorrow, he would leave his sanctuary.

Tomorrow, he would step into the chaos of the Feast and hunt for a murderer among the tile-sellers and sailors and merchants.

Tomorrow, he would prove that a dragon who ran a library could also be a dragon who brought justice.

But tonight, he would prepare.

Cornelius moved through the dark library with fluid, silent grace. He checked the locks on every window. Reinforced the bar on the front door. Ensured the rear delivery entrance was sealed.

Then he climbed the spiral stairs to the archive level and retrieved a small leather satchel from the storage closet. Inside, he placed:

- A notebook and two pencils.
- His private incident log.
- The intake form Elias had signed.
- A vial of mint oil (for focus).
- A pouch of dried cricket (for sustenance).

He returned to the main floor and set the satchel beside his desk.

Outside, the Feast noise began to fade. The drums grew quieter. The laughter turned to murmurs. The city was settling into the late-night lull before dawn.

Cornelius stood in the center of his library and looked up at the amber dome.

The glass panels caught the faint glow of distant lanterns, scattering light across the shelves like scattered stars.

This was his hoard.

Not gold. Not gems.

Knowledge. Order. Silence.

And he would defend it.

Even if it meant becoming something more than a dragon who ran a library.

Even if it meant becoming a dragon who hunted thieves.

Cornelius folded his wings and extinguished the last lamp.

The library fell into complete darkness.

And in that darkness, he made his choice.

Tomorrow, they would begin.

Tomorrow, they would go to House Doukas.

# Chapter 6

# Chapter 6

The Doukas estate smelled wrong.

Cornelius had known it would. Tile workshops always did—clay dust, turpentine, the acrid bite of kiln smoke. But knowing did not make it easier to tolerate. He stood at the iron gates, his wings folded tight against his sides, and resisted the urge to sneeze.

"You okay?" Zeph asked. The boy had dressed in plain cotton today, as instructed. No bright colors. Nothing that would draw attention. He looked like half the other youths in the market district—lanky, ordinary, forgettable.

Perfect.

"I am fine." Cornelius adjusted his spectacles with one claw. "The air quality here is simply... industrial."

"It's a tile workshop. What'd you expect?"

"I expected ceramic production residue. I did not expect to *taste* it." Cornelius's tongue flicked out involuntarily, sampling the air. Clay. Silica. Something sharp and chemical that coated the back of his throat. "No matter. We proceed."

The estate itself was a monument to House Doukas's ambitions. The outer walls were covered in decorative tiles—geometric patterns in blue and white and gold, each piece fitted with such precision that the mortar lines were nearly invisible. The gates bore the Doukas spiral emblem in wrought iron. Beyond them, a courtyard stretched toward a two-story main house, also tiled, also gleaming.

New money, trying very hard to look like old money.

Cornelius had seen this pattern before. The Doukas family had risen in the last two generations on the strength of artistic innovation and aggressive contracts. They produced fewer tiles than the Veneti workshops but commanded higher prices for custom work. Temples. Council chambers. Wealthy homes.

And they *hated* House Kallistos with a passion that was now, very possibly, criminal.

Cornelius approached the gate and pulled the bell cord.

A servant appeared—human, middle-aged, wearing a blue tunic embroidered with the spiral. He looked down at Cornelius with the expression of someone who had been interrupted during important work.

"The workshop is closed to visitors during the Feast," he said.

"I am not a visitor. I am Cornelius Drake, Curator of the Solterra Bay Library. I am here to speak with Sophia Doukas regarding a matter of legal significance."

The servant's expression shifted. Not quite respect, but caution. "Does she expect you?"

"She should." Cornelius kept his voice crisp and formal. "The Watch has opened an inquiry into the death of Elias of Tyre. Sophia Doukas was seen speaking with the deceased the day before his death. I am conducting follow-up interviews on behalf of the investigation."

It was not precisely a lie. He *was* investigating. And Theo *had* opened an inquiry, even if he had then promptly closed it.

The servant hesitated, then unlocked the gate. "Wait in the courtyard. I will see if Mistress Sophia is available."

He disappeared into the main house.

Cornelius stepped through the gate with Zeph close behind. The courtyard was paved in tiles—of course it was—arranged in a spiral pattern that radiated from a central fountain. The fountain itself was dry, its basin filled with ceramic scraps and broken tools.

Even their courtyard was a work-in-progress showcase.

"Fancy," Zeph muttered. He was looking up at the house. "Lot of tile."

"House Doukas believes in advertising their craft." Cornelius moved toward the fountain and studied the broken pieces in the basin. Curved shards. Test glazes in half a dozen colors. The remnants of failed experiments. "They want everyone who enters to see their skill."

"And their money."

"That, too."

Footsteps echoed from the house. Not the servant returning.

Heavier. More deliberate.

Cornelius turned.

Sophia Doukas descended the front steps with the posture of someone walking onto a stage. She was tall for a human woman, perhaps fifty years old, with dark hair streaked with gray and pulled back in a severe braid. Her dress was deep blue linen—the same shade as the thread Cornelius had seen on Sister Photine's sandal—and her hands were stained with glaze residue.

She stopped at the base of the steps and regarded Cornelius with the expression one might use when discovering mold on bread.

"Curator," she said. The title sounded like an insult. "I was told you wished to speak with me."

"I do." Cornelius stepped away from the fountain and faced her directly. "I am investigating the circumstances surrounding the death of Elias of Tyre. I have reason to believe you can provide relevant information."

Sophia's gaze flicked to Zeph, then back to Cornelius. "The Watch already spoke with me. I told Captain Melas everything I know."

"Which was?"

"Very little." She crossed her arms. "Elias was a courier. I hired him once to deliver a sample to a client in the port district. That is the extent of our association."

Cornelius's tail curled. She was lying. Or at minimum, omitting.

"When did you hire him?" he asked.

"Two weeks ago. Perhaps three. I do not track such details."

"And you have not seen him since?"

"No."

Cornelius let the silence stretch. He watched Sophia's face, her posture, the small movements of her hands. She stood very still, but her fingers twitched slightly against her arms.

Nervous.

"That is curious," Cornelius said. "Because you were seen speaking with Elias in the Feast market on Day One. Three days ago. The conversation appeared... heated."

Sophia's jaw tightened. "I do not recall."

"You do not recall arguing with a man in the public square two days before his death?"

"I speak with many people during the Feast. Suppliers. Clients. Guild representatives." Her voice sharpened. "If I had a 'heated conversation,' it was likely about a late shipment or substandard materials. Nothing of criminal significance."

Cornelius tilted his head. "I did not say the matter was criminal."

Sophia's hands clenched. "Elias is dead. You are here asking questions. What else would it be?"

"That is what I am attempting to determine." Cornelius stepped closer. He was small—barely the size of a large cat—but he had learned long ago that size mattered less than certainty. "You argued with a courier. The courier is now dead. The death occurred during a theft at my library. You will forgive me if I find the coincidence... noteworthy."

"I had nothing to do with any theft."

"I did not say you did."

Sophia's face flushed. "Then what are you implying?"

"I am not implying. I am *observing*." Cornelius let his wings unfold slightly, catching the light. "And I observe that you are far more defensive than someone with 'very little' connection to the deceased ought to be."

Behind him, Zeph shifted his weight. Cornelius could feel the boy's attention like a tether, steady and waiting.

Sophia's gaze darted to Zeph again, then back to Cornelius. She was calculating. Deciding how much to say.

Finally, she exhaled. "Fine. Yes. I saw Elias in the market. He owed me money for a prior delivery that he failed to complete. I demanded payment. He refused. We argued. That is all."

"What delivery?"

"A commission to a buyer in the upper city. Elias was supposed to deliver ceramic inserts for a mosaic panel. He claimed the buyer was unavailable and returned the pieces to me. I suspected he simply did not want to make the climb."

"And this argument took place the day before he died."

"Yes."

"And you did not think to mention this to Captain Melas when he interviewed you?"

"Why would I? A financial dispute over a failed delivery has nothing to do with his death." Sophia's voice was ice now. "Unless you are accusing me of murder, Curator, I suggest you take your questions elsewhere."

Cornelius studied her.

The flush in her cheeks. The tightness in her jaw. The way her hands kept clenching and unclenching against her arms.

Anger. Yes.

But also fear.

He had rattled her.

"I am not accusing you of anything," Cornelius said smoothly. "I am simply gathering information. The Watch's investigation was... cursory. I am ensuring no details were overlooked."

"How thorough." Sophia's tone could have frozen wine. "Is there anything else, or may I return to my work?"

Cornelius let his gaze drift deliberately over her appearance. The blue dress. The glaze stains on her hands. The—

He stopped.

There.

Around her neck, a scarf of pale cream linen, knotted loosely at the throat. It did not match the dress. Did not match her aesthetic at all. And it sat strangely, as though covering something.

Bruises? A rash?

Or simply the self-consciousness of someone trying to hide stress?

And lower, at the hem of her dress—

The blue thread.

The same blue thread he had seen on Sister Photine's sandal.

It was fresh. Newly sewn. A line of careful stitches mending a small tear along the hem, the thread chosen to blend with the dress fabric but not quite matching. A rush job. Something done quickly, perhaps early this morning.

The same thread.

The same *exact* thread.

Cornelius's mind raced. Thread was not unique. Many people used blue thread. But this shade—deep cobalt with a slight sheen—was distinctive. And to find it in two places connected to his investigation?

Not a coincidence.

"Your dress is beautiful," Cornelius said. His voice was light, conversational. "House Doukas work?"

Sophia blinked at the sudden shift. "What?"

"The embroidery. The cut. It is clearly a custom piece. I wondered if it was produced in your own workshop or commissioned elsewhere."

"I—" Sophia glanced down at herself. "It is mine. I designed it."

"And the mending?" Cornelius gestured with one claw toward the hem. "The blue thread along the bottom. Was that also your work?"

Sophia's hand moved instinctively to the hem. "I tore it yesterday. Caught it on a kiln grate. I repaired it this morning. Why does that matter?"

"It does not. I simply appreciate craftsmanship." Cornelius adjusted his spectacles. "The thread is quite fine. Imported?"

"Local. From the dyer in the lower market." Sophia's voice had turned wary again. "Curator, if you are finished with your... observations, I really must return to work. The Feast contracts wait for no one."

"Of course." Cornelius inclined his head. "One last question."

"What?"

"Did Elias ever mention why he was at the library the day he died?"

Sophia froze.

It was just a moment. A single heartbeat. But Cornelius saw it—the way her breath caught, the way her shoulders stiffened.

"No," she said. "I told you. I barely knew him."

"But you argued with him. About payment."

"About a failed delivery. Not about the library."

"Yet he died there. In a vault. After delivering a package that has since been stolen." Cornelius kept his tone mild, curious. "You can see why I find your connection to him... interesting."

"There is no connection." Sophia's voice rose. "I hired a courier. The courier failed to complete a job. I demanded payment. That is the beginning and end of my involvement. If he died in your library, that is your problem, not mine."

"Indeed." Cornelius studied her. The flush had spread to her neck now, visible above the cream scarf. Her hands were trembling slightly. "Thank you for your time, Mistress Doukas. You have been very... informative."

Sophia turned and stalked back toward the house. Her steps were fast, tight, controlled.

She was halfway up the stairs when her hand went to her pocket.

And then she stopped.

Turned.

Looked down at the courtyard tiles.

A small square of fabric lay on the ground between where she had been standing and where Cornelius now stood. White linen. Embroidered in one corner.

A handkerchief.

It must have fallen from her pocket when she moved.

Sophia started back down the steps.

Zeph moved first.

"I've got it," he said cheerfully. He strode forward and scooped up the handkerchief before Sophia could reach it. "You dropped this, Mistress."

He held it out.

Sophia snatched it from his hand. "Thank you."

But Cornelius had seen it.

Just for a moment, as Zeph lifted it. The embroidery in the corner.

A monogram.

A single letter, stitched in dark thread.

*P.*

Sophia shoved the handkerchief back into her pocket and disappeared into the house without another word.

The servant reappeared and gestured toward the gate. "If you are finished...?"

"Yes. Thank you." Cornelius turned and walked toward the exit with as much dignity as he could muster while his mind spun in three directions at once.

Zeph followed, silent until they were through the gate and back on the street.

"So," Zeph said. "She's lying."

"Emphatically." Cornelius's claws clicked against the cobblestones as he moved down the street, away from the estate. "She hired Elias. She argued with him. She knows more than she is saying."

"Yeah, but we already knew that. Did we learn anything new?"

Cornelius glanced back at the estate. The tiled walls. The dry fountain. The house where Sophia Doukas was undoubtedly pacing and worrying and wondering what Cornelius had seen.

"Yes," he said. "The thread."

"What thread?"

"The blue thread on her hem. It matches the thread I saw on Sister Photine's sandal during the body examination." Cornelius's tail curled in satisfaction. "They share a thread source. Which means they share a location. Or a supplier. Or—"

"Or Photine mended Sophia's dress," Zeph said.

Cornelius stopped walking. "What?"

"I mean, healers sew, right? Stitches and stuff. Maybe Sophia tore her dress and Photine fixed it. They could be friends."

Cornelius considered this.

It was plausible. Infuriatingly plausible.

But it still meant a connection. Sophia and Photine, linked by thread and proximity. And Photine had certified Elias's death as natural causes despite clear evidence of poison.

"Perhaps," Cornelius said. "But it remains a connection worth noting."

"What about the handkerchief?"

"What about it?"

"The monogram. You saw it, right? The letter?"

"Yes. *P.*" Cornelius resumed walking, his mind already assembling the pieces. "Which could stand for several names. Photine. Or..."

"Or?"

"Petros Kallistos."

Zeph stopped. "Wait. The drunk guy? The one who owned the vault?"

"Yes." Cornelius's wings flared slightly. "Sophia Doukas carries a handkerchief monogrammed with a *P*. Petros Kallistos was found in the library archive with a ventilation schematic he cannot explain. Both are connected to the theft. Both have means and motive."

"You think they're working together?"

"I think it is a hypothesis worth exploring." Cornelius turned down a side street, heading back toward the library. "House Doukas and House Kallistos are rivals. Bitter rivals. But what if that rivalry is a performance? What if they are secretly collaborating?"

"Why would they do that?"

"I do not know yet. But the handkerchief suggests a personal connection. Something beyond business." Cornelius's mind raced. "A romance, perhaps. Or blackmail. Or—"

He stopped.

Turned.

"Zeph. When you picked up the handkerchief. Did you notice anything else about it?"

Zeph frowned. "Like what?"

"A scent. A texture. Anything."

"Uh..." Zeph thought. "It smelled kind of... flowery? And also like paint thinner."

Cornelius's claws dug into the cobblestones.

Flowery.

Lilac.

Petros Kallistos had reeked of lilac water the day they found him in the archive. An expensive scent. The kind worn by wealthy men trying to cover the smell of wine and poor decisions.

And paint thinner—turpentine. The same scent that permeated the Doukas estate.

The handkerchief carried both.

Which meant it had been in contact with both Petros and Sophia.

Cornelius turned and began walking again, faster now. "We are returning to the library."

"Why? What's wrong?"

"Nothing is wrong. Everything is *right*." Cornelius's tail lashed. "The handkerchief links Sophia to Petros. The blue thread links Sophia to Photine. And we already know Petros provided vault information to a stranger at a tavern. The pieces are connecting."

"So what do we do?"

"We document." Cornelius's wings folded tight with satisfaction. "And then we find proof."

"Proof of what?"

"That Sophia Doukas and Petros Kallistos conspired to rob his own family's vault." Cornelius's voice was firm. Certain. "She had the means—access to alchemical materials through her workshop. He had the access—his own family's vault. Together, they planned the theft. Hired Elias as their tool. And when something went wrong, they eliminated him."

"With poison."

"With poison." Cornelius nodded. "Certified as natural causes by a healer who shares Sophia's thread supplier and is therefore likely part of the conspiracy."

Zeph was quiet for a moment. Then he said, "That's... a lot of conspiracy."

"It is a logical chain of evidence." Cornelius adjusted his spectacles. "And I intend to prove every link."

They walked in silence for several blocks, threading through the Feast crowds. The market square was loud today—drums and flutes and the crash of barrels being unloaded at the docks. Cornelius ignored it all. His mind was already back at the library, drafting the new entry in his incident log.

*Sophia Doukas: Confirmed liar. Confirmed connection to Elias. Carries handkerchief monogrammed 'P' (Petros Kallistos?) smelling of lilac and turpentine. Blue thread on dress matches thread observed on Sister Photine's sandal during body examination. Hypothesis: Sophia and Petros are co-conspirators. Photine is complicit in cover-up.*

The pattern was emerging. Clear. Undeniable.

He just needed one more piece of evidence to make it irrefutable.

They reached the library. Cornelius unlocked the front door and stepped into the cool, quiet sanctuary of his domain. The vanilla-and-dust scent settled over him like a balm after the industrial assault of the Doukas estate.

Home.

He moved to his desk and retrieved his private ledger, flipping to the suspect web he had drawn the night before.

Sophia Doukas.

Petros Kallistos.

Sister Photine.

He drew a new line connecting Sophia to Petros. Labeled it: *Handkerchief. Lilac + Turpentine.*

Then another line connecting Sophia to Photine. Labeled it: *Blue thread. Shared supplier or direct contact.*

The web was tightening.

Zeph leaned over his shoulder. "You really think it's them?"

"I think the evidence points in that direction." Cornelius set down his pen. "But evidence is not proof. Not yet. We need something concrete. Something Theo cannot dismiss."

"Like what?"

"Like the stolen correspondence. Or the tool used to melt the vault seal. Or a witness who saw them together." Cornelius tapped the page. "We have fragments. We need the whole picture."

"So we keep watching."

"Yes. We keep watching." Cornelius closed the ledger and locked it in his desk drawer. "But now we know where to watch. Sophia will make a mistake. They always do. And when she does, we will be ready."

Zeph nodded. He looked tired. They had been awake since before dawn, walking to the Doukas estate, conducting the interview, walking back.

"Go home," Cornelius said. "Eat. Rest. Return tonight and we will plan the next phase."

"You sure?"

"Yes. I have documentation to complete. And you have been standing for three hours." Cornelius gestured toward the door. "Go. I will be fine."

Zeph hesitated, then nodded. "Okay. But if anything happens—"

"I will send word."

"Promise?"

"I promise."

Zeph left, pulling the door shut behind him.

Cornelius stood alone in his library, surrounded by shelves and silence.

He moved to the supply cabinet and retrieved his incident log, carrying it back to the desk.

But before he opened it, he reached into his pocket.

His claws closed around a small square of fabric.

White linen. Soft. Expensive.

He had taken it while Sophia was distracted. While Zeph was handing her the decoy handkerchief—the one she had dropped and reclaimed.

This was the real one.

The one Zeph had palmed and passed to Cornelius in the moment Sophia turned away.

The boy was clever. Cornelius would have to remember to praise him for that later.

He spread the handkerchief on his desk and studied the embroidery in the corner.

The monogram was dark blue thread. Precise stitching. Professionally done, not a personal touch.

*P.*

Cornelius lifted the fabric to his face and inhaled carefully.

Lilac. Faint but unmistakable. The same scent Petros had worn.

And beneath it, sharper—turpentine. The chemical bite of Sophia's workshop.

The handkerchief had been in contact with both of them.

Which meant they had been in contact with each other.

Recently.

Cornelius folded the handkerchief and placed it carefully between two blank pages in his incident log. Evidence. Material. Concrete.

He opened the log to a fresh page and began to write.

*Spring Feast, Day Three. Morning.*

*Interview with Sophia Doukas at the Doukas estate. Subject was evasive and defensive. Admitted to arguing with Elias over a failed delivery but denied any connection to his death or the library theft.*

*Physical observations:*

*- Cream scarf worn at throat (unusual for her style; possibly concealing stress marks or injury).*

*- Fresh mending on dress hem using distinctive blue thread, identical to thread observed on Sister Photine's sandal.*

*- Dropped handkerchief bearing monogram 'P' and scents of lilac (associated with Petros Kallistos) and turpentine (workshop chemical).*

*Conclusion: Sophia Doukas and Petros Kallistos are personally connected. The nature of the connection remains unclear (romantic? conspiratorial?) but is materially relevant to the theft and Elias's death.*

*Next steps: Determine the relationship between Sophia and Petros. Identify the source of the 'P' monogram. Locate the stolen correspondence.*

Cornelius set down his pen and leaned back in his chair.

The pieces were falling into place.

Slowly. Methodically. Exactly as they should.

And soon—very soon—he would have enough to present an irrefutable case.

Not to Theo. Theo had already demonstrated his inadequacy.

But to someone who mattered. The Council. The Guild. The families themselves.

Justice would be served.

And Cornelius would prove that a dragon who ran a library could also be a dragon who solved murders.

He folded his wings and looked up at the amber dome, the light filtering through the glass in soft, steady patterns.

Outside, the Feast raged on.

But inside, order was being restored.

One careful observation at a time.

# Chapter 7

# Chapter 7

The docks smelled wrong.

Not wrong the way the Doukas estate had smelled wrong—industrial and chemical and specific. This was a different kind of assault. A *layered* assault.

Salt. Fish guts. Damp wool. The sharp, medicinal bite of anise liquor. Tar. Rope. Sweat. And beneath it all, the wet-stone funk of the harbor itself, where seawater pooled between cobblestones and rotted planks.

Cornelius stopped at the edge of the market district and stared down the sloping street toward the docks.

"You okay?" Zeph asked.

"I am reconsidering the wisdom of this expedition."

"We're already here."

"Yes. Unfortunately." Cornelius's tongue flicked out involuntarily, sampling the air. He regretted it immediately. The taste coated the back of his throat like old fish oil. "I despise the docks."

"You despise everything that's not the library."

"Untrue. I tolerate many things. The archive. The mint vendor. Clean parchment." Cornelius adjusted his spectacles and forced himself to continue down the cobblestones. "I simply prefer environments that do not *assault* the senses."

Zeph grinned. "Yeah, but Mago's ship is down here. And you said he's the guy Petros talked to at the tavern, right? The one who asked about the vault?"

"It is a reasonable hypothesis." Cornelius stepped carefully over a puddle of something he refused to identify. "Petros described a 'large, eastern-accented man.' Mago Hanno fits that description. He was also observed watching the library the morning after the crime. And he is a known smuggler with access to restricted goods."

"Like fireworks."

"Among other things." Cornelius's tail curled. "Fireworks contain accelerants. Accelerants produce the kind of heat necessary to melt iron. Therefore, Mago is a potential source for the tool used to breach the vault."

"Or he's just the guy who bought Elias drinks and asked nosy questions."

"That is also possible." Cornelius sidestepped a coil of rope lying across the walkway. "Which is why we are here. To determine which hypothesis is correct."

The street widened as it approached the harbor, opening onto a broad cobblestone plaza lined with warehouses and taverns. Ships crowded the docks—merchant vessels, fishing boats, sleek trading galleons from the southern ports. The Spring Feast had drawn them all in like moths to flame, and the plaza roared with activity.

Sailors hauled crates. Merchants shouted prices. A trio of gulls fought over something unidentifiable near a stack of barrels.

Cornelius's wings folded tight against his sides.

Too loud. Too chaotic. Too many *people*.

Zeph pointed toward a building near the end of the dock. "That's The Gilded Gull. The bouncer there knows everyone who comes through. If Mago's around, he'll know where."

"How do you know that?"

"My cousin works the fishmonger stall. She says the Gull's where all the captains drink."

Cornelius studied the tavern. It was a squat, two-story structure built directly into the harbor wall, with walls stained dark from years of salt spray. A wooden sign hung above the door—a gull painted in flaking gold leaf, wings spread wide.

"Very well. Lead the way."

Zeph wove through the crowd with the easy confidence of someone who had grown up in these streets. Cornelius followed, staying close and resisting the urge to hiss at anyone who stepped too near.

The Gilded Gull's interior was dim and smelled overwhelmingly of anise. Cornelius's nose wrinkled. Ouzo. The local liquor. It permeated everything—the wooden bar, the tables, even the air itself.

A dozen patrons sat scattered throughout the room. Sailors, mostly. A few merchants. One very tired-looking dockworker slumped over a bowl of soup.

Behind the bar, a broad-shouldered orc woman with graying hair and a scarred jaw wiped down glasses with a rag that had seen better days. She glanced up as Cornelius and Zeph entered, her gaze lingering on Cornelius for a moment before returning to her work.

Zeph approached the bar. "Excuse me. We're looking for Captain Mago Hanno. Is he around?"

The orc woman set down her glass. "Who's asking?"

"We are," Cornelius said. He hopped onto a barstool—it took two tries and was deeply undignified—and met her gaze directly. "I am Cornelius Drake, Curator of the Solterra Bay Library. I need to speak with Captain Mago regarding a matter of legal significance."

The woman's expression did not change. "Library business at the docks. That's new."

"It is a unique situation."

She studied him for a long moment, then jerked her head toward the door. "His ship's the *Erinyes*. Berth seven. Big black hull, red sails. You can't miss it."

"Thank you." Cornelius slid off the stool—also undignified—and turned toward the exit.

"Curator," the woman said.

He stopped.

"Mago don't like surprises. And he *really* don't like people poking into his business." Her gaze flicked to Zeph. "You might want to leave the kid here."

"The 'kid' is my associate. He accompanies me."

The woman shrugged. "Your funeral."

Cornelius did not dignify that with a response. He walked out of the tavern with Zeph close behind.

The docks proper stretched out before them—a maze of wooden piers and mooring posts extending into the harbor. Ships of all sizes bobbed in the water, their masts swaying slightly with the rhythm of the tide.

Berth seven was at the far end, near the harbor wall.

And the *Erinyes* was exactly as described.

The ship was large—a three-masted trading galleon with a black-painted hull and sails the color of dried blood. The name was stenciled across the stern in white letters. On deck, a handful of crew members moved about, securing cargo and adjusting rigging.

And standing at the gangplank, arms crossed and watching their approach, was Captain Mago Hanno.

He was exactly as Cornelius remembered from their brief, silent confrontation two days ago. Tall—easily seven feet. Broad. Scarred. His tusks were capped in silver, and his hair was pulled back in a tight braid threaded with bone beads. He wore a long coat of dark leather, salt-stained and patched in a dozen places.

He looked like a man who had seen violence and was comfortable with it.

Cornelius stopped at the base of the gangplank and lifted his chin. "Captain Mago Hanno."

Mago's gaze shifted from Cornelius to Zeph, then back to Cornelius. "Curator."

"I wish to speak with you."

"So I gathered." Mago's voice was a low rumble, heavily accented—eastern ports, exactly as Petros had described. "You walked all the way down here. You got my attention. Now what?"

"I am investigating the death of Elias of Tyre. I have reason to believe you may have information relevant to the case."

Mago's expression did not change. "You working for the Watch now?"

"I am working independently."

"That a fact." Mago tilted his head slightly. "And what makes you think I got anything to say about some dead courier?"

"You were observed watching the library the morning after his death. You fit the description of a man seen speaking with Petros Kallistos at a tavern shortly before the crime. And Elias was killed during a theft involving materials you are known to traffic." Cornelius kept his voice level. Professional. "I do not believe in coincidences of that magnitude."

Mago stared at him for a long moment. Then, unexpectedly, he laughed. It was a short, sharp sound, more bark than humor.

"You got stones, Curator. I'll give you that." He gestured up the gangplank. "Come on, then. You want to talk, we talk. But not out here where every fishwife can hear."

Cornelius hesitated.

Walking onto Mago's ship meant entering the captain's territory. His domain. A place where the law of the docks—murky at best—held more weight than the law of the city.

Dangerous.

But also necessary.

Cornelius climbed the gangplank. His claws clicked against the wood. Zeph followed, and Cornelius could feel the boy's nervousness in the way he walked—tight steps, hands shoved in his pockets.

The deck of the *Erinyes* was organized chaos. Crates stacked along the rails. Coils of rope. Barrels lashed to the mast. The crew—three orcs and two humans—watched them pass with varying degrees of curiosity and suspicion.

Mago led them toward the stern, stopping near a hatch that led below deck. He turned and leaned against a crate, arms crossed.

"All right. You got your private conversation. Talk."

Cornelius folded his wings. "What was your relationship with Elias of Tyre?"

"He owed me money."

"How much?"

"Enough." Mago's gaze was flat. Unreadable. "Kid had a gambling problem. Dice, cards, anything with odds. He'd bet on whether the tide came in. Lost more than he won."

"And you extended him credit."

"I extend everyone credit. That's how business works." Mago's tusks gleamed faintly in the dim light. "But I also collect. Always."

"Did Elias repay you?"

"He was working on it."

"How?"

Mago studied him. "You already know, don't you? That's why you're here."

"I have a theory. I would prefer confirmation."

"I bet you would." Mago shifted his weight, the crate creaking beneath him. "Fine. Elias said he had a job lined up. Big payout. Enough to clear his debt and then some. He just needed a little more time."

"What job?"

"Didn't say. Didn't ask. Wasn't my business as long as he paid."

"And did he pay?"

Mago's expression darkened. "No. He died before he could."

Cornelius's claws dug into the wood of the deck. "When did he tell you about this 'job'?"

"Two weeks ago. Maybe three. He came to the Gull, nervous as a cat in a kennel. Said he had an opportunity. Something valuable. *Kallistos gold*, he called it."

Cornelius's wings flared slightly.

Kallistos gold.

Not literal gold. The Kallistos vault did not store currency. It stored *correspondence*. Letters. Contracts. Documents.

But to the right buyer, those could be worth more than gold.

Family secrets. Trade agreements. Blackmail material.

"Did he specify what he meant by 'Kallistos gold'?" Cornelius asked carefully.

"No. And I didn't ask. Just told him I wanted my money by the end of the Feast or his luck would run out permanently." Mago's voice was matter-of-fact. "Guess it ran out early."

Zeph shifted beside Cornelius. "So you were gonna kill him if he didn't pay?"

Mago's gaze locked onto Zeph. "I was gonna collect. One way or another. Whether that meant money or knees is a question we didn't get to answer."

Cornelius stepped slightly forward, placing himself between Mago and Zeph. "Elias died in my library. During a theft. The stolen items match what you described as 'Kallistos gold.' You were seen watching the library the morning after. Explain."

"Nothing to explain. I heard a courier died at the library. I knew Elias was working as a courier. I went to see if it was him." Mago shrugged. "It was. So I wrote off the debt and moved on."

"You expect me to believe you had no involvement in the theft?"

"I expect you to believe what you want, Curator. I'm just telling you facts." Mago leaned forward slightly. "Elias owed me money. He promised to pay using something he planned to steal from the Kallistos vault. He died before he could finish the job. I didn't kill him. I didn't hire him. I just gave him a deadline he didn't meet."

Cornelius studied the orc's face. The scars. The flat, unapologetic gaze.

He was telling the truth.

Or at least, a version of it.

Mago had not orchestrated the theft. But he had been the *pressure*. The threat that pushed Elias into desperation.

And desperation made people do dangerous things.

Like agreeing to rob a warded vault.

Like trusting the wrong people.

Like dying on a library floor with poison in their lungs.

"Thank you for your candor," Cornelius said. His voice was cold. Controlled. "That will be all."

"That's it? You're done?"

"I have the information I came for."

Mago laughed again, that short, humorless bark. "You got spine, Curator. I'll give you that. Most people don't walk onto my ship and interrogate me."

"Most people are not investigating a murder in their sanctuary."

"Fair." Mago straightened. "You need anything else, you know where to find me. But next time, maybe send a message first. Showing up unannounced is bad for business."

Cornelius turned toward the gangplank.

And stopped.

Zeph was staring at something near the hatch.

Cornelius followed his gaze.

There, partially visible through the open hatch, was a crate. Wooden. Unmarked except for a single symbol burned into the side—a stylized flame.

And through the slats, Cornelius could see the distinctive red-and-gold wrapping of firework charges.

Illegal fireworks.

The kind banned within city limits because of their volatility and the accelerants used in their construction.

The kind that could melt iron.

Cornelius's mind raced.

Mago trafficked in restricted goods. Fireworks were restricted goods. The vault seal had been melted using an accelerant.

The connection was circumstantial. But it was *there*.

Mago noticed where Zeph was looking. His expression shifted, the casual openness draining into something colder.

"You got a problem, kid?"

Zeph swallowed. "No. Just... looking."

"Look somewhere else."

"We are leaving." Cornelius's voice was firm. He moved toward the gangplank and gestured for Zeph to follow. "Thank you for your time, Captain."

But Mago stepped between them and the gangplank.

He did not move aggressively. Did not draw a weapon. Did not raise his voice.

He just *stood there*.

And somehow, that was more menacing than any overt threat.

"You know," Mago said quietly, "I don't mind questions. Questions are part of doing business. But I *do* mind people poking around my cargo. Especially people who might go running to the Watch about what they see."

"I have no intention of—"

"Sure you don't." Mago's gaze shifted to Zeph. "Kid, you seem smart. Smarter than your boss, maybe. So let me give you some advice. The docks are dangerous. Accidents happen. Cargo shifts. People fall off piers. You understand?"

Zeph's face went pale.

Cornelius's wings flared.

"Do not," Cornelius said, his voice dropping into a register he rarely used, "threaten my apprentice."

Mago's gaze snapped to him. "That wasn't a threat. That was friendly advice."

"It was a threat. And I do not tolerate threats against those under my protection." Cornelius stepped forward, placing himself directly between Mago and Zeph. He was small—barely cat-sized—but he drew himself up to his full height and let the hoard-guardian instinct blaze in his chest. "You may be a captain on your ship. But Zeph is *mine*. And I do not share."

The air between them crackled.

Not literally. Cornelius had no breath weapon he could safely use in close quarters, no magic that could stop an orc smuggler.

But he had *presence*. The primal, territorial fury of a dragon whose hoard had been threatened.

And Mago, to his credit, recognized it.

The orc tilted his head slightly, reevaluating. Then, slowly, he stepped aside.

"You're braver than you look, Curator."

"And you are exactly as dangerous as I expected." Cornelius kept his wings spread, his gaze locked on Mago. "We are leaving now. If you have further business with me, you may visit the library during normal operating hours."

"I'll keep that in mind."

Cornelius descended the gangplank with measured, deliberate steps. Zeph followed close behind, not speaking, not looking back.

They walked the length of the dock in silence.

Past the warehouses.

Past The Gilded Gull.

Past the market plaza.

Only when they reached the street leading back toward the library district did Zeph finally speak.

"He was gonna hurt me."

"Yes."

"And you stopped him."

"Yes."

Zeph was quiet for a moment. Then, quieter: "Thanks."

Cornelius's wings folded against his sides. The adrenaline was fading now, leaving behind a faint tremor in his claws and a hollow feeling in his chest.

He had just challenged an armed smuggler on his own ship.

With nothing but posture and pride.

Idiotic.

Reckless.

Necessary.

"You are my apprentice," Cornelius said. His voice was steady, even if his claws were not. "Threatening you is the same as threatening my hoard. I do not tolerate either."

Zeph grinned. It was shaky, but genuine. "I'm part of your hoard now?"

"Do not let it go to your head."

"Too late."

They walked in silence for another block. The noise and chaos of the docks faded behind them, replaced by the quieter sounds of the market district—vendors packing up their stalls, the distant clatter of cart wheels on cobblestones.

Finally, Cornelius said, "We have the motive."

"Debt," Zeph said. "Elias owed Mago a fortune. Needed to pay it off or get his knees broken. So he agreed to steal from the vault."

"Precisely. Which means Elias was not simply a courier caught in the wrong place. He was an active participant. Willing or coerced, he planned to rob the Kallistos vault and use the stolen correspondence to pay his debt."

"But he didn't finish the job."

"No. He died before he could deliver the stolen goods." Cornelius's tail curled. "Which raises the question: who killed him? And why?"

"Maybe Sophia found out he was planning to sell the letters to Mago instead of giving them to her."

"Possible. Or perhaps the theft went wrong and his co-conspirators eliminated him to cover their involvement." Cornelius adjusted his spectacles. "Either way, we now know *why* Elias was in the vault. Greed. Desperation. The same motives that have driven criminals since the beginning of recorded history."

"And Mago?"

"Mago is a smuggler and a lender of last resort. Unpleasant, yes. Dangerous, absolutely. But not our murderer." Cornelius glanced back toward the docks. "He wanted his money. Dead couriers do not pay debts."

"He's got fireworks, though. The restricted kind."

"I noticed."

"You think he sold the accelerant to whoever melted the vault?"

"It is plausible. But we have no proof. And after that encounter, I suspect Captain Mago will be far less cooperative if we attempt to question him further." Cornelius's wings twitched. "We will note the fireworks in the log and proceed with our existing leads."

"Sophia and Petros."

"Yes. The handkerchief. The blue thread. The connections we can prove." Cornelius turned down the street toward the library, his mind already moving ahead to the next steps. "Mago gave us the *why*. Now we need the *who* and the *how*."

Zeph nodded. He was still pale, but his steps were steadier now.

They walked the rest of the way in companionable silence.

And when the library finally came into view—its amber dome rising above the rooftops, solid and familiar and *safe*—Cornelius felt the tightness in his chest begin to ease.

Home.

His hoard.

Intact.

For now.

# Chapter 8

# Chapter 8

The library steps felt wrong beneath Cornelius's claws.

Not the steps themselves. Those were the same sun-bleached limestone they had always been, worn smooth by centuries of feet. Solid. Familiar. *His*.

What felt wrong was standing on them looking *up* at locked doors instead of standing inside looking out.

"Maybe they just closed early for the Feast," Zeph said. He was squinting at the main entrance, hands shoved in his pockets. "You know. Because nobody's been coming in anyway."

"The library does not close early." Cornelius climbed another step, his tail lashing behind him. "I am the Curator. I decide the hours. And I did not authorize closure."

"Then why's the door barred?"

That was the question, was it not?

Heavy iron bars had been fitted across both main doors—the same storm-season bars normally stored in the basement. Someone had retrieved them, hauled them up three flights of stairs, and installed them across the entrance with the kind of thoroughness that suggested they were not meant to be removed quickly.

Cornelius's wings flared.

"This is unacceptable," he said. His voice was clipped. Controlled. Absolutely *furious*. "Someone has sealed my library without authorization. Without notification. Without—"

"Uh, Cornelius?"

"—without the slightest regard for procedure or—"

"Cornelius."

"*What?*"

Zeph pointed.

A figure was walking across the plaza toward them. Tall. Broad-shouldered. Wearing the dark blue tunic of the city Watch.

Captain Theo Melas.

Cornelius's claws scored the limestone.

Theo climbed the steps with the expression of a man who had already decided this conversation would be unpleasant and was determined to get through it as efficiently as possible. He stopped two steps below Cornelius and Zeph, pulled a rolled parchment from his belt, and held it out.

"Curator Drake. I need you to review this."

Cornelius did not take the parchment. "What is it?"

"Official notice. By order of the Council, the Solterra Bay Library is closed to all access pending completion of the Watch investigation into the death of Elias of Tyre and the related theft from the Kallistos vault. This includes custodial staff, family representatives, and—" Theo glanced at the parchment, "—the Curator."

The world narrowed.

Cornelius heard the words. Understood them individually. But strung together, they made no sense.

"Closed," he repeated.

"That's correct."

"My library."

"The city's library," Theo corrected. "Maintained under civic charter. Which means the Council has authority to restrict access during an active criminal investigation."

"You *closed* your investigation. You certified the death as natural causes. You sealed the vault and confiscated the key." Cornelius's voice rose slightly despite his best efforts to control it. "There *is* no active investigation."

"There's an incomplete investigation," Theo said. "I reopened the case this morning after receiving new testimony suggesting the death may not have been accidental."

Cornelius's wings snapped open. "I *told* you it was not accidental. Two days ago. In explicit detail."

"You gave me a theory. Now I have corroboration from a second source. Which means I need to conduct a proper investigation. Which means I need the building secured and undisturbed until my people can complete a full survey of the scene."

"I have not disturbed anything."

"You've been conducting your own investigation. Interviewing witnesses. Visiting suspects." Theo's expression was flat. Professional. "You went to the Doukas estate yesterday. You boarded Captain Mago Hanno's ship this morning. You've been asking questions all over the city about a case I explicitly told you to stay out of."

Cornelius's tail coiled. "I am gathering information relevant to a crime that occurred in my library. That is not interference. That is diligence."

"That's obstruction. And it stops now." Theo held out the parchment again. "You're banned from the library until the investigation is complete. No access. No exceptions. If you attempt to enter the building, you'll be arrested for tampering with a crime scene."

"You cannot do this."

"I can. I am." Theo's voice gentled slightly. "Look, I know you're upset. But you need to step back and let the Watch handle this. That's what we're trained for."

"You are trained to accept convenient explanations and close cases before the Feast crowds get nervous." Cornelius's claws dug into the stone. "I am trained to *observe*. To *document*. To find truth in details you dismiss as irrelevant."

"And I appreciate that. I do. But this is a murder investigation now. Not a library inventory project." Theo gestured at the barred doors. "You've done your part. You reported the crime. You preserved the scene. Now let me do mine."

"How long?"

"What?"

"How long will the library remain closed?"

Theo hesitated. "Until the end of the Feast. Maybe a few days after. Depends on what we find."

"A *week*."

"Could be less—"

"You are banning me from my own sanctuary for a week. During the largest trade event of the year. When the Council will be watching to see if the library is a *safe* place to store valuable materials." Cornelius's voice shook. "You are destroying the institution's reputation to protect your investigation. An investigation you would not even be conducting if I had not forced you to reopen it."

"I'm doing my job."

"You are doing the *minimum*." Cornelius stepped forward. He was small—barely the size of a large cat—but he put every ounce of draconic fury into his posture. "You certified a poisoning as natural causes. You dismissed evidence. You confiscated my vault key and sealed a crime scene without conducting a proper investigation. And now, when I have spent two days doing the work *you* should have done from the beginning, you ban me from my own library and claim authority you have not earned."

Theo's jaw tightened. "You want to file a complaint, you can take it up with the Council. But right now, you need to step away from the building. This is not a negotiation."

Cornelius stared at him.

At the parchment in his hand. The iron bars across the doors. The flat, bureaucratic certainty in Theo's eyes.

The Watch was not here to solve the crime.

They were here to *contain* it.

"Fine," Cornelius said. His voice was ice. "I will step away. But understand this, Captain: when your investigation fails—and it *will* fail—I will ensure the Council knows exactly why."

He turned and descended the steps with as much dignity as a small, furious dragon could muster.

Zeph followed, glancing back at Theo with an unreadable expression.

They did not speak until they had crossed the plaza and turned down a side street, out of sight of the library and the Watch guard Theo had left posted at the doors.

Only then did Cornelius stop walking.

He stood in the middle of the narrow street, wings folded tight, tail coiled, every line of his body radiating controlled fury.

"Breathe," Zeph said quietly.

"I am breathing."

"You're vibrating."

Cornelius exhaled slowly. The boy was correct. His scales were trembling with the effort of not screaming.

"He barred my library," Cornelius said. His voice was very quiet. Very controlled. "He sealed the doors. Posted a guard. Banned me from my own sanctuary."

"Yeah."

"I cannot access my records. My ledgers. My incident log. The correspondence catalogs that would prove Elias was planning to steal Kallistos documents." Cornelius's claws flexed. "Everything I need to build a case is inside that building. And Theo has locked me out."

"So what do we do?"

"I do not know."

It was the first time Cornelius had admitted that aloud.

The first time he had acknowledged that the institutional power he had always relied on—the authority of the library, the sanctity of his role—meant *nothing* when the Watch decided to exercise their legal prerogative.

He was a dragon who ran a library.

And Theo had just made it very clear that "running a library" did not grant him the power to investigate a murder.

Zeph was quiet for a moment. Then he said, "What if we went in anyway?"

Cornelius looked at him. "The building is barred. There is a guard at the door."

"At the *front* door. Yeah." Zeph shifted his weight. "But there are other ways in."

"The rear entrance is certainly also secured—"

"I'm not talking about doors."

Cornelius's tail uncurled slightly. "What are you talking about?"

Zeph reached into his pocket and pulled out a folded piece of parchment. It was creased and slightly torn, the ink smudged in places from being handled too many times.

Cornelius recognized it immediately.

The schematic.

The ventilation map they had found in Petros Kallistos's lap the morning of the murder.

"Why do you still have that?" Cornelius asked.

"Because I've been looking at it." Zeph unfolded the parchment carefully. "You said it was proof Petros knew how to get into the vault. That he gave the map to whoever broke in."

"Yes."

"But I don't think it's a map. I think it's a schedule."

Cornelius tilted his head. "Explain."

Zeph pointed to the notations along the margins. "See these? They're not routes. They're dates. Maintenance cycles. 'South archive grate cleaned third Sixthday of spring.' 'Upper reading room vent checked first Secondday of summer.' It's a log. Someone's been tracking when the vents get serviced."

Cornelius stared at the parchment.

He had seen those notations. Had dismissed them as irrelevant detail. His focus had been on the *layout*—the branching network of shafts and grates that connected every room in the library.

But Zeph was right.

This was not a thief's map.

This was a *maintenance schedule*.

Which meant—

"Petros was not planning the theft," Cornelius said slowly. "He was tracking when the vents would be accessible. When they would be *open*."

"Yeah. And look." Zeph pointed to a specific notation near the vault chamber. "South vault vent. Last serviced two weeks ago. Next service scheduled for end of summer."

"Two weeks ago." Cornelius's mind raced. "Before Elias delivered the package. Before the theft."

"So someone knew the vent would be clean. No dust to disturb. No cobwebs. Easy access if you knew where to climb." Zeph folded the parchment. "And if Petros had this schedule, he could've told whoever he was working with exactly when and where to enter the building without being seen."

Cornelius's wings flared.

It fit.

The drunken confession about discussing the vault with a stranger at a tavern. The schematic found in his possession. The ventilation grate removed in the south archive.

Petros had not been a grieving vault owner.

He had been an *informant*.

Providing the technical details necessary to bypass the library's physical security.

And now that same ventilation system—the system Cornelius had dismissed as peripheral infrastructure—was sitting in front of him. Documented. Mapped. *Open*.

"You are suggesting we break into the library," Cornelius said.

"I'm suggesting we use the route the thief used. The vents." Zeph tapped the parchment. "If we can get into the south archive, we can access the main floor. Get the records we need. Get out before the Watch even knows we were there."

"That is illegal."

"Yeah."

"Theo explicitly banned me from the building."

"I know."

"If we are caught, we will be arrested. You could lose your Academy placement. I could lose my position as Curator."

"I know," Zeph said again. He met Cornelius's gaze. "But if we don't do this, Theo's gonna spend a week poking around the library, not find anything useful, and close the case again. And whoever killed Elias gets away with it."

Cornelius stared at the boy.

At the folded parchment in his hands. The nervous determination in his eyes. The way he stood—weight forward, shoulders set—like someone who had already decided and was just waiting for permission.

When had Zeph become this?

Not the careless intern who brought pastries into the reading room.

Not the boy who needed to be told which shelves to dust.

This was someone who saw a problem and proposed a *felony* as the logical solution.

And the worst part was, Cornelius could not find a flaw in the reasoning.

He needed the library records. The correspondence logs. The intake forms. The private ledger locked in his desk.

All of it was inside the building.

And the only way to retrieve it was to commit a crime.

Against his own sanctuary.

Cornelius's claws flexed.

"The south archive grate," he said. "The one removed during the theft. Is it replaced?"

"I checked when we found Petros. It was loose. Just sitting in the frame. Anyone could lift it out."

"And the route from the grate to the main floor?"

Zeph studied the schematic. "Looks like a straight shot through the lower vent shaft. Comes out behind the circulation desk."

"That vent is narrow. I can fit. You cannot."

"I don't need to fit all the way through. I just need to get into the archive and hand you what you need from the other side."

"And if the Watch is patrolling inside the building?"

"Then we wait until they're not. Theo's got, what, six guards? Maybe eight? They can't watch every room all night." Zeph's voice was steady. Certain. "We go in after dark. Stay quiet. Get what we need. Get out."

Cornelius closed his eyes.

This was madness.

This was *necessary* madness.

"We would need tools. A pry bar for the grate. A light source. A way to signal if one of us is discovered."

"I can get tools. My cousin's got a toolbox at the fish stall."

"And if we are caught?"

"Then we tell the truth. That we needed records from your own library to solve a murder Theo's not even trying to solve." Zeph's jaw set. "It's not like we're robbing the place. We're just... retrieving evidence."

"That is not how the law works."

"Yeah, well, the law just locked you out of your own home. So maybe the law can stuff it."

Cornelius's wings twitched.

The boy had a point.

A deeply, fundamentally illegal point.

But a point nonetheless.

He opened his eyes and looked at the library rising above the rooftops in the distance. The amber dome catching the late afternoon light. The stone walls that had stood for three hundred years.

His sanctuary.

His hoard.

Now barred to him by bureaucracy and institutional cowardice.

Theo thought sealing the building would force Cornelius to step aside.

To accept his place as a mere custodian. A dragon who ran a library and nothing more.

But Theo had made a critical miscalculation.

Cornelius was not just the Curator.

He was the *guardian*.

And guardians did not ask permission to defend their hoard.

"Tonight," Cornelius said. His voice was quiet. Firm. "We will need darkness and silence. The second watch rotation ends at midnight. The guard will be tired. Inattentive."

Zeph's eyes widened. "You're serious."

"I am always serious." Cornelius adjusted his spectacles. "You will acquire the tools. I will plan the route. We will meet at the south wall of the library one hour after midnight. Wear dark clothing. Bring nothing that makes noise."

"Okay. Yeah. I can do that."

"And Zeph?"

"Yeah?"

Cornelius met his gaze. "If we are discovered, you will claim I coerced you. That I threatened your Academy placement. That you were following my orders under duress."

"I'm not gonna—"

"You *will*." Cornelius's voice was iron. "I am the Curator. I have tenure and Guild protection. You are a sixteen-year-old intern. If this fails, I can survive the professional consequences. You cannot. Do you understand?"

Zeph swallowed. "Yeah. I understand."

"Good." Cornelius turned and began walking toward the lower district. "Go home. Eat. Rest. Gather what we need. And do not speak of this to anyone. Not your cousin. Not your friends. No one."

"Where are you going?"

"To my quarters. To prepare." Cornelius glanced back. "Tonight, we commit a felony. I intend to ensure we commit it *competently*."

Zeph nodded, a small, nervous smile tugging at the corner of his mouth.

Then he turned and jogged toward the market district, disappearing into the Feast crowds.

Cornelius stood alone in the narrow street, the noise of the city buzzing around him like static.

He looked at the library one more time.

At the iron bars. The posted guard. The locked doors.

Theo had made this necessary.

The Council had made this inevitable.

And Cornelius would be damned if he let institutional incompetence destroy everything he had built.

He folded his wings tight and walked toward his small rented room above the bookbinder's shop.

There was work to do.

Plans to make.

Evidence to retrieve.

And a murderer to catch.

Even if he had to become a criminal to do it.

# Chapter 9

# Chapter 9

The ventilation grate came away with barely a whisper.

Cornelius watched from the shadows of the alley as Zeph's hands worked the edges, lifting the metal frame free and setting it carefully against the library's stone wall. The boy moved with surprising quiet for someone whose usual interaction with furniture involved tripping over it.

"Clear," Zeph breathed.

Cornelius crossed the gap between the hedge and the wall in three quick movements, his wings folded tight, his claws silent on packed earth. The opening gaped before him—a dark rectangle leading into the ventilation shaft. Narrow. Very narrow.

Perfect.

He glanced up at Zeph. "Remember the signals."

"Two taps if you need me to pull you back. Three if you're coming out. One long scratch if there's a guard." Zeph's voice was steady despite the way his hands trembled slightly on the grate. "I got it."

"And if we are discovered—"

"You threatened my Academy placement. I was coerced. Yeah, yeah." Zeph made a shooing motion. "Go. Before the next patrol loop."

Cornelius adjusted his spectacles, took a breath that tasted of old stone and metal, and climbed into the vent.

The shaft swallowed him immediately.

Cold. Dark. The metal walls pressed close on all sides, and the air carried the particular staleness of a space that had not been opened to the outside in weeks. Exactly as the maintenance schedule had indicated.

Cornelius's claws found purchase on the seams between panels. He pulled himself forward, wings tucked so tight they ached, tail trailing behind like a rope. The schematic had shown a straight path—twenty feet horizontal, then a vertical drop of eight feet into the lower archive corridor.

Twenty feet had never felt so long.

The metal creaked softly beneath his weight. Dust—ancient, undisturbed dust—coated everything. It tickled his nostrils and made his eyes water behind his spectacles. He resisted the urge to sneeze. Barely.

*Narrow. Dark. Enclosed.*

This was the opposite of everything the library represented. The opposite of high ceilings and open reading rooms and light filtering through amber glass.

This was the space *between* the sanctuary.

The hidden infrastructure that made order possible.

And someone had used it to commit murder.

Cornelius's claws dug harder into the metal.

The shaft turned downward.

He braced his wings against the sides and let gravity pull him into the vertical drop, controlling his descent with pressure against the walls. Eight feet. The schematic had been precise.

His hindclaws touched stone.

The vent opened into a narrow maintenance corridor behind the archive shelves—exactly where the map had indicated. Cornelius squeezed through the opening and dropped the final six inches to the floor.

Silence.

The kind of silence that only existed in libraries after hours. Heavy. Expectant. The weight of thousands of books holding their breath.

*Home.*

Cornelius stood motionless, letting his eyes adjust to the darkness. Faint moonlight filtered through the high windows of the main hall, enough to cast the archive into a patchwork of shadow and dim geometry. Rows of shelves stretched away in both directions. Stone floor. Stone walls. The smell of old parchment and leather bindings and dust.

His sanctuary.

Locked away from him by bureaucratic cowardice.

But not inaccessible.

Never truly inaccessible to someone who knew its bones.

Cornelius moved deeper into the archives, his claws silent on stone worn smooth by centuries of footsteps. The correspondence files were three rows east, second tier, organized by family name and date range.

Kallistos. K. Second shelf.

He found the section quickly—his own cataloging system made navigation effortless even in near-darkness. The Family Vault Correspondence Log sat precisely where it should, a leather-bound ledger thick with decades of intake records.

Cornelius pulled it from the shelf and carried it to a reading table near the window, where the moonlight was strongest.

The ledger opened with a soft creak.

He flipped to the most recent entries, running his claw down the page until he found what he needed.

*Elias of Tyre. Courier. Package received Third Fourthday, Spring. Contents declared: Sentimental correspondence. Sender: Eudora of Naxos.*

Cornelius had written that entry himself three days ago. Neat, precise script. Every word carefully chosen. Every detail logged.

But it was the intake form—the original document Elias had filled out—that Cornelius needed now.

He turned to the back of the ledger where the physical forms were stored in chronological order, found Elias's form, and pulled it free.

The handwriting was immediately recognizable. Cramped. Uneven. Letters slanting in different directions as though each word had been written by a slightly different hand. The "E" in "Elias" listed awkwardly to the right. The "o" in "Naxos" was barely closed.

Terrible penmanship.

The handwriting of someone who wrote rarely and resented the effort.

Cornelius studied it carefully, committing the distinctive slant and spacing to memory. Then he set the form aside and moved to the next shelf.

The Kallistos family business correspondence—non-vault material—occupied an entire row. Contracts. Trading agreements. Receipts. Tax records.

All signed by Petros Kallistos.

Cornelius pulled three documents at random and carried them back to the table.

The moonlight caught the signatures.

Petros's handwriting was… distinctive.

Aggressive. Sloppy. Words crammed together as though parchment were a finite resource he resented wasting. Letters crushed and irregular, the ink heavy in some strokes and nearly invisible in others.

But the slant was identical to Elias's intake form.

The same rightward list. The same uneven pressure. The same barely-closed loops on the "o" and "a."

Cornelius's wings flared slightly.

Petros had not *hired* Elias.

Petros *was* Elias.

No.

That made no sense. They were clearly different people. Cornelius had *seen* them both.

But the handwriting—

He forced himself to slow down. To think.

Elias had filled out the intake form under Petros's direction. Petros had dictated the information. Elias, nervous and semi-literate, had written it in his own terrible hand.

That explained the match.

But it also meant Petros had been directly involved in the package delivery. Had known exactly what was being placed in the vault. Had likely *arranged* for Eudora to send it.

Cornelius's tail curled.

The pieces were aligning.

Petros owned the vault. Petros had the access codes. Petros had been found drunk in the archives with a ventilation schematic in his lap. Petros had admitted to discussing the vault with a stranger at a tavern.

And now, Petros's handwriting connected him directly to the fraudulent intake form.

Cornelius turned back to the vault records and flipped through the older entries, looking for any prior correspondence between Petros and Eudora.

Nothing.

The package had been the first item Eudora ever sent to the Kallistos vault.

Which meant it had been arranged specifically for this theft.

A tool. A key. Something designed to bypass the wards and melt the vault seal.

Delivered by a desperate courier who owed money to a smuggler and needed one big score to clear his debts.

Opened by Petros, who had access to the vault and knowledge of the wards.

And then—

What?

Had Elias betrayed Petros? Tried to steal the correspondence for himself?

Or had Petros betrayed Elias, using him to commit the theft and then poisoning him to eliminate the witness?

Cornelius tapped his claws against the table.

The handwriting evidence pointed to Petros.

The ventilation schematic pointed to Petros.

The tavern conversation pointed to Petros.

But something still felt incomplete.

The poison. The method. The efficiency of the vault breach.

Petros was a drunk. A careless, privileged man who could not even remember how he had ended up in the archives. That did not suggest the kind of meticulous planning required to melt a warded vault seal and deploy an inhaled toxin without leaving trace evidence.

Unless—

Cornelius's gaze drifted to the ventilation schematic, still tucked in his pocket.

He pulled it out and unfolded it on the table beside the handwriting samples.

The schematic's notations were precise. Clean. Each letter carefully formed, each date written in a steady, controlled hand.

Nothing like Petros's aggressive scrawl.

Nothing like Elias's cramped slant.

This had been written by someone with training. Someone who valued clarity and accuracy.

Someone like a tile maker, perhaps, accustomed to drafting architectural plans and calculating measurements.

Sophia.

Cornelius's claws flexed.

Sophia Doukas had argued with Elias in the marketplace. Sophia's blue thread had been found on Sister Photine's sandal. Sophia's handkerchief—monogrammed with a "P"—smelled of both lilac and turpentine.

Lilac. Petros's scent.

Turpentine. The Doukas workshop.

A connection between Sophia and Petros. Hidden. Personal.

And this schematic, written in a careful, professional hand, had ended up in Petros's possession.

Because Sophia had given it to him.

Cornelius's mind raced through the logic.

Sophia had access to alchemical materials through the tile workshop. She had the technical skill to plan a vault breach. She had argued with Elias about payment and a failed "task."

But she did not have access to the vault itself.

Petros did.

They had worked together.

Sophia provided the plan, the tools, the technical expertise.

Petros provided the access, the codes, the inside knowledge.

And Elias—poor, desperate, doomed Elias—had been the courier. The expendable piece. The one who delivered the package, opened the vault, and then became a liability.

Cornelius's tail lashed.

The case was solving itself.

He just needed proof.

He turned back to the archive shelves and began pulling files. Business correspondence. Tax records. Anything with Petros's handwriting that might contain additional evidence of his involvement.

Three files in, he found it.

A small scrap of parchment, folded and tucked between two unrelated documents in the tax folder. The kind of thing that might have been used as a bookmark and then forgotten.

Cornelius unfolded it carefully.

Four lines of text. Written in the same aggressive, sloppy hand as Petros's signatures.

*Vault Code: 4-4-9*
*Delivery: Third Fourthday, dawn*
*Payment on completion*
*Burn this*

Cornelius's wings snapped open.

The vault code.

Written in Petros's own hand.

With instructions to burn the note.

Which meant Petros had written this for someone else. Had provided the code—his own family vault's code—to a co-conspirator.

To Sophia.

Or to Elias.

Or to both.

Cornelius read the note again, his claws trembling slightly against the parchment.

This was it.

The physical evidence linking Petros directly to the crime.

He had written down the vault code. Had arranged the delivery timing. Had planned to destroy the evidence.

And he had failed to destroy it, because he had been too drunk or too careless or too stupid to follow through.

Just like he had failed to destroy the ventilation schematic.

Just like he had failed to keep his mouth shut at the tavern.

Petros Kallistos was the insider. The access point. The weak link in his own family's security.

And he had sold that access for—what?

Money? A promised cut of the stolen correspondence's value?

Or something else?

Cornelius thought of Sophia's handkerchief. The lilac scent. The monogrammed "P."

Not something else.

*Someone* else.

Sophia and Petros. Working together. Conspirators and perhaps more.

The rival families, locked in public competition, conducting a private alliance.

It fit.

Every piece fit.

Cornelius carefully folded the note and tucked it into his inner pocket alongside the intake form. Evidence. Proof. The documentation that would unravel Petros's lies and force Theo to reopen the investigation properly.

He returned the files to their shelves, erasing any sign of his presence. The ledger went back to its place. The contracts were reshelf in chronological order.

The archives looked exactly as they had when he entered.

Except now, Cornelius carried the truth.

He moved back through the shadows toward the ventilation corridor, his mind already composing the report he would write. The evidence he would present. The careful, methodical dismantling of Petros's manufactured innocence.

The vent shaft loomed before him.

Cornelius paused at the entrance and looked back at the archives one last time.

His sanctuary. His hoard.

Violated by greed and betrayal.

But not lost.

Never lost.

He climbed into the shaft and began the journey back toward the surface, pulling himself through the narrow metal passage with steady, determined movements.

The case was solved.

Petros had provided the vault code. Sophia had provided the plan and tools. Elias had been their courier and fall guy.

And when Elias had failed—or betrayed them—they had eliminated him.

Poison in the vault. A body on the floor. A convenient lie about natural causes, supported by Sister Photine's compromised examination.

All of it orchestrated by two people who thought themselves clever enough to steal from a warded library and escape consequences.

They had underestimated the Curator.

Cornelius's claws found the horizontal shaft. Twenty feet to the exit. Twenty feet to fresh air and Zeph's worried face and the next phase of the investigation.

He moved faster now, confidence overriding caution.

The evidence was secured. The truth was clear.

All that remained was presenting it to authorities who could not ignore documentation this thorough.

Not Theo. Theo had already proven himself compromised or incompetent.

But the Council. The Guild. The family representatives who would demand answers when confronted with proof of Petros's betrayal.

Cornelius would bypass the Watch entirely.

Go directly to the powers that could force a real investigation.

And he would do it with the meticulous, irrefutable documentation that was his specialty.

Let Theo complain about procedure.

Let the Watch protest jurisdiction.

Cornelius had the evidence. The handwriting samples. The vault code in Petros's own hand.

The truth.

And truth, properly documented, could not be dismissed.

He reached the exterior grate. Moonlight filtered through the metal slats. Zeph's silhouette shifted in the darkness beyond.

Cornelius tapped three times against the shaft wall.

The signal. Coming out.

The grate lifted away.

Cool night air rushed into the shaft, cutting through the stale metallic taste. Cornelius emerged into the alley, wings spreading automatically to shake off the cramped confinement.

Zeph replaced the grate with quick, practiced movements, then turned to Cornelius with wide eyes.

"You get it? The records?"

"I got more than records." Cornelius's voice was steady. Certain. The voice of someone who had solved an impossible puzzle through pure intellectual rigor. "I found proof."

"Proof of what?"

"Petros wrote down the vault code. Gave it to his co-conspirators. I have the note in his own handwriting." Cornelius adjusted his spectacles, which had gone slightly askew during the climb. "Along with handwriting samples that tie him directly to Elias's intake form."

Zeph's face lit up. "So he's the one who—"

"He and Sophia. Working together. She provided the technical expertise and materials. He provided access to the vault." Cornelius began walking toward the street, keeping to the shadows. "Elias was their courier. When he failed to complete the theft—or attempted to steal the correspondence for himself—they poisoned him."

"holy shit." Zeph hurried to keep pace. "You actually solved it. In like, twenty minutes."

"The evidence was always there. The Watch simply lacked the intellectual rigor to assemble it properly." Cornelius's tail swished with satisfaction. "Petros's drunken carelessness left a trail even a moderately competent investigator could follow. I merely had to access the documentation."

"So what now? We take this to Theo?"

"No. Theo has demonstrated his inadequacy repeatedly. We will bypass him entirely." Cornelius turned down a side street, away from the library and toward his rented room. "Tomorrow, I will draft a formal report to the Council, the Curator's Guild, and the Kallistos family representatives. I will include the handwriting evidence, the vault code note, and a complete timeline of Petros's involvement."

"They'll have to reopen the case."

"They will have no choice. The evidence is conclusive." Cornelius felt a warm sense of vindication spreading through his chest. The satisfaction of a puzzle solved. A mystery unraveled. Order restored through pure logical deduction. "Petros will be arrested. Sophia will be questioned. Sister Photine's complicity will be investigated. And the library will be cleared of all suspicion."

Zeph grinned. "You're kind of terrifying when you're right, you know that?"

"I am *always* right. People simply fail to recognize it until I provide documentation."

They walked in silence for another block. The Feast crowds had thinned at this hour, leaving the streets mostly empty except for the occasional late-night reveler stumbling home from a tavern.

Cornelius's mind was already drafting the report. The precise language he would use. The way he would structure the evidence to make refusal impossible.

*Timeline of Events: Petros Kallistos conspires with Sophia Doukas to rob his own family vault...*

*Evidence Item One: Vault access code written in Petros's distinctive hand...*

*Evidence Item Two: Handwriting analysis connecting Petros to fraudulent intake documentation...*

*Evidence Item Three: Ventilation schematic in professional hand, indicating Sophia Doukas's involvement in planning...*

It would be perfect.

Irrefutable.

The kind of documentation that ended careers and sent criminals to trial.

Cornelius's wings rustled with satisfaction.

"You should get some sleep," he told Zeph as they reached the intersection where their paths diverged. "Tomorrow will be a long day. I will need you at the library—legally, through the front door—once the Council forces Theo to lift the closure."

"You think they'll do it that fast?"

"Once they see my report, they will have no choice." Cornelius adjusted his spectacles one final time. "The evidence speaks for itself. Petros is the killer. And I can prove it."

Zeph's grin widened. "Guess you really are a detective, huh? Not just a librarian."

"I am a Curator. Detection is simply another form of cataloging." Cornelius turned toward his building. "Go home. Rest. Tomorrow, we end this properly."

"Yeah. Okay." Zeph hesitated, then added quietly: "Thanks. For... you know. Letting me help."

"You are my apprentice. Helping is your function." But Cornelius's voice had softened slightly. "You performed adequately tonight."

"Wow. High praise."

"Do not let it go to your head."

Zeph laughed and headed off toward the lower district, his footsteps fading into the night.

Cornelius stood alone in the empty street, the weight of the stolen evidence warm against his chest.

The case was solved.

Petros Kallistos had betrayed his own family.

Had conspired with a rival house.

Had murdered a desperate courier to cover his crimes.

And Cornelius Drake, Curator of the Solterra Bay Library, had documented every step.

He climbed the stairs to his small room, his mind already composing the opening paragraph of his report.

By morning, the Council would know the truth.

By afternoon, Petros would be in custody.

And by evening, the library would be cleared, reopened, and restored to its rightful role as the sanctuary of knowledge and order.

Cornelius settled at his desk, pulled out fresh parchment, and began to write.

The truth, properly documented, was unstoppable.

And he had never been more certain of anything in his life.

# Chapter 10

# Chapter 10

The Golden Amphora smelled of spilled ale and fried fish.

Cornelius stood in the doorway, wings folded tight against the press of bodies, and resisted the urge to turn around and leave immediately. The tavern was *loud*. Voices layered over voices in a cacophony of trading gossip and Feast business. Someone in the back corner was playing a badly tuned lyre. The floor was sticky.

This was the opposite of his sanctuary.

This was chaos given architectural form.

But Petros Kallistos was inside—Zeph had spotted him through the front window ten minutes ago—and Cornelius had not come this far to retreat simply because the venue was aesthetically offensive.

"You sure about this?" Zeph asked quietly. He was pressed against Cornelius's side, trying to look casual despite the way his eyes kept darting around the crowd. "I mean, accusing him in front of all these people?"

"I am always sure." Cornelius adjusted his spectacles and stepped into the tavern. "Public accountability makes denial impossible. Once I present the evidence, Petros will have no choice but to confess or be exposed as a liar in front of his peers."

"And if he just... lies anyway?"

"Then I will document his lies and add them to my report." Cornelius's tail swished with satisfaction. "But he will not. The evidence is too conclusive. He will recognize that resistance is futile and surrender to the inevitable."

Zeph did not look convinced, but he followed anyway.

The crowd parted reluctantly as Cornelius moved through it. People glanced down, did double-takes at the small dragon navigating between their legs, and shuffled aside with varying degrees of grace. A few muttered greetings. Most simply stared.

Cornelius ignored them all.

His focus was on the corner table where Petros Kallistos sat slumped over a cup of wine, looking exactly as miserable as a man who had betrayed his own family vault deserved to look.

Perfect.

Cornelius crossed the final stretch of sticky floor and stopped directly in front of Petros's table.

"Petros Kallistos," he said. His voice cut through the ambient noise with the precision of a carefully thrown knife. "We need to speak."

Petros looked up slowly. His eyes were red-rimmed and unfocused. Wine stained the front of his tunic. He blinked at Cornelius with the confusion of someone who could not quite remember how he had ended up in a tavern at ten in the morning.

"Dragon," Petros said. His voice was thick. Slurred. "Library dragon. What're you doing here?"

"I am here because you committed a crime." Cornelius's wings flared slightly. "And I have proof."

The conversations around them began to quiet.

People were listening now. Turning toward the corner table. Setting down their cups and leaning in to hear what the dragon was saying to one of the Kallistos scions.

Excellent.

An audience made this better. More official. More *final*.

Cornelius reached into his inner pocket and pulled out the folded parchment—the note he had found tucked in Petros's tax records. He set it on the table with deliberate precision, smoothing the creases so the text was clearly visible.

"Do you recognize this?" Cornelius asked.

Petros stared at the parchment. His bloodshot eyes moved slowly across the words. Then he looked back at Cornelius with an expression that might have been confusion or guilt or simply exhaustion.

"Where did you get that?"

"From your files. In the library archive." Cornelius tapped the parchment with one claw. "Your handwriting. Your vault code. Instructions to burn the note. Written for your co-conspirators."

Petros's face went pale.

The tavern had gone almost silent now. Even the badly tuned lyre had stopped.

Cornelius felt a surge of vindication. This was it. The moment when the careful documentation and logical deduction paid off. When the criminal realized he had been caught by someone smarter, more thorough, more *competent* than the investigators who had dismissed the case as natural causes.

"You gave the vault code to Sophia Doukas," Cornelius continued. His voice was steady. Certain. "You arranged for Elias of Tyre to deliver a package containing the tools necessary to breach the vault wards. You conspired to steal your own family's correspondence—probably to sell it or use it for blackmail. And when Elias failed to complete the theft properly, you poisoned him to eliminate the witness."

Someone in the crowd gasped.

Petros just stared at him.

"You were found drunk in the archives with a ventilation schematic in your lap," Cornelius said. "You admitted to discussing the vault with a stranger at a tavern. Your handwriting matches the intake form Elias signed. And this note—" He tapped the parchment again, "—proves you provided the access code to your co-conspirators. The evidence is conclusive. You are guilty."

The silence stretched.

Petros looked at the note. At Cornelius. At the crowd of people watching with wide eyes and open mouths.

Then he started laughing.

It was not the laugh of a man caught and trying to bluster his way out.

It was the laugh of someone so exhausted and broken that the absurdity of the accusation had pushed him past anger into something darker.

"You think I killed Elias," Petros said. His voice was ragged. Bitter. "You think I robbed my own vault."

"The evidence—"

"The evidence is shit." Petros pushed the parchment back across the table. "Yeah, I wrote that note. Elias asked me to. Three weeks ago. Said he needed the code to check on a package his client was sending. Said it was important. Time-sensitive. I was drunk. I wrote it down for him." He laughed again, sharper this time. "Told him to burn it after. Guess he didn't."

Cornelius's tail stilled. "That is a convenient excuse—"

"It's the *truth*." Petros leaned forward, elbows on the table, wine-cup forgotten. "You want to know where I was the night Elias died? I was in the Watch drunk tank. Got hauled in for pissing in the Council fountain at sunset. Spent the whole night in a cell. Didn't get released until after sunrise."

The world tilted.

Cornelius's claws flexed against the table edge. "You are lying."

"Ask Captain Melas. Ask any of the Watch guards. They had me locked up from dusk to dawn." Petros's expression was hollow. Defeated. "I didn't kill anyone. I didn't steal anything. I'm just a drunk idiot who trusted the wrong courier and wrote down my vault code because I was too plastered to think straight."

No.

No, that could not be correct.

The evidence pointed to Petros. The note. The handwriting. The schematic. The tavern confession.

It all *fit*.

"The ventilation map," Cornelius said. His voice sounded strange in his own ears. Tight. "You had it in your possession. You gave the maintenance schedule to—"

"I woke up with it." Petros rubbed his face. "Don't know how it got there. Don't remember anything after the fourth cup of wine at the Laughing Gull. I sure as hell didn't plan a robbery. I can barely plan my own breakfast."

Someone in the crowd snickered.

Cornelius's wings trembled.

The alibi was ironclad. If Petros had been in the Watch drunk tank during the theft and murder, he could not have physically committed the crime. Could not have opened the vault. Could not have poisoned Elias.

Which meant—

Which meant the entire theory was wrong.

Petros had not conspired with Sophia.

Petros had been *used*.

Tricked into writing the vault code by Elias weeks before the theft. Plied with alcohol and manipulated into discussing the wards at a tavern. Planted with a ventilation schematic while unconscious.

Elias had not been the expendable courier.

Elias had been the *planner*.

And Cornelius had missed it entirely.

"You accused me of murder," Petros said quietly. His voice was flat now. Empty. "In front of half the merchant district. Based on a note I wrote when I was drunk and a map I don't even remember seeing."

Cornelius opened his mouth. Closed it.

The documentation had been perfect. The logical chain had been sound. Every piece of evidence had pointed to Petros as the insider, the access point, the weak link.

But the conclusion had been *wrong*.

"I..." Cornelius's tail coiled tight. "I was following the evidence."

"You were following your own assumptions." Petros picked up his wine cup and drained it in one long swallow. "You decided I was guilty and found evidence to match. That's not investigation. That's... I don't even know what that is."

The crowd was murmuring now. Voices rising in agreement. Someone near the bar said something about "foreign dragon" and "Kallistos honor." Someone else muttered about "accusations" and "proof."

The mood was shifting.

Cornelius felt it like a physical change in the air. The curiosity and shock that had followed his accusation was curdling into something uglier.

Anger.

Directed at him.

"You should leave," Petros said. He was not looking at Cornelius anymore. Just staring into his empty cup. "Before someone decides you've insulted the family badly enough to do something about it."

"I was attempting to solve a murder—"

"You were showing off." Petros's voice was bitter. "Playing detective. Trying to prove you're smarter than the Watch. And you picked the easiest target. The drunk. The failure. The embarrassment to House Kallistos." He finally looked up, and his eyes were hard. Cold. "Well, congratulations. You embarrassed yourself instead."

The murmuring grew louder.

Someone near the door stood up. A broad-shouldered man wearing Kallistos house colors. His expression was not friendly.

Zeph's hand closed around Cornelius's wing. "We should go. Like, right now."

Cornelius could not move.

His mind was racing, trying to salvage the theory, trying to find a way the evidence could still point to Petros despite the alibi, but every angle led back to the same conclusion.

He had been wrong.

Catastrophically, publicly wrong.

"Cornelius." Zeph's voice was urgent now. "They're getting up."

More people were standing. Moving toward the corner table. Their faces angry. Protective of the Kallistos name and the drunk scion who had just been humiliated by an outsider.

By a dragon who ran a library and thought he could play investigator.

Cornelius's wings snapped open.

The sudden movement startled the nearest people back half a step—just enough space for Cornelius to turn and bolt toward the door.

Zeph was right behind him.

They hit the street at a run, Cornelius's claws scrabbling on cobblestones, Zeph's longer legs eating distance in awkward, gangly strides.

Behind them, the tavern door slammed open.

Voices shouted. Angry. Insulted.

But Cornelius did not look back.

He ran.

Down one street. Around a corner. Through an alley that smelled of fish and brine. Another turn. Another street.

Only when they had put three full blocks between themselves and the Golden Amphora did Cornelius finally stop, wings heaving, claws aching from the sprint across rough stone.

Zeph collapsed against a wall, breathing hard. "Holy shit. Holy *shit*. I thought they were gonna throw bottles at us."

Cornelius said nothing.

He stood in the middle of the empty street, trembling, the weight of his failure pressing down like a physical thing.

The evidence had been real. The handwriting match. The vault code. The schematic.

But the conclusion had been wrong.

He had built a perfect logical structure on a foundation of incorrect assumptions.

And he had presented it publicly. With absolute certainty. With *smugness*.

In front of witnesses.

Including the man he had falsely accused.

"So, uh." Zeph straightened, still breathing hard. "What now?"

Cornelius could not answer.

Because he did not know.

The case was not solved. Petros was not the killer. The evidence that had seemed so conclusive was just... fragments. Pieces of a puzzle he had assembled incorrectly.

And now he had no theory at all.

Just a library he could not access, a murderer still free, and the certainty that half the merchant district would be talking about the foreign dragon who had accused a Kallistos scion of murder based on a drunk's scribbled note.

His wings folded tight.

His tail coiled around his hindclaws.

And for the first time since the investigation began, Cornelius Drake did not know what to do next.

"He was in jail," Cornelius said finally. His voice was quiet. Hollow. "The entire time. He could not have committed the crime."

"Yeah." Zeph shifted his weight. "I heard."

"Which means Elias planned the theft himself. Manipulated Petros into providing the code. Used him as a source of information and access without Petros even realizing he was being used."

"Sounds like it."

"Which means my entire reconstruction of events was fundamentally flawed." Cornelius's claws scraped against stone. "I followed the evidence to the wrong conclusion. Mistook the tool for the actor. Accused an innocent man of murder."

Zeph did not argue.

The silence stretched between them.

Cornelius had been so *certain*. So convinced that his intellectual rigor and careful documentation had cut through the Watch's incompetence to find the truth.

But he had been wrong.

And everyone knew it.

"We should..." Zeph trailed off. "I mean, maybe we go back to the library? Check if Theo's lifted the closure yet? We could—"

"No." Cornelius's voice was flat. "The library is still sealed. I am still banned. And I have just demonstrated precisely why Captain Melas was correct to exclude me from the investigation."

"That's not—"

"I humiliated myself. Publicly. In front of witnesses who will ensure the story spreads through every tavern and trading house in the city." Cornelius turned away from Zeph, unable to meet his eyes. "I proved that I am exactly what Theo said I was. A dragon who runs a library. Not an investigator. Not a detective. Just a Curator who overestimated his own competence."

"You were trying to solve a murder—"

"I was trying to prove I was clever." The admission tasted bitter. "And I failed."

The Spring Feast crowds moved past them on the main street, oblivious to the small dragon and his apprentice standing frozen in the alley.

Cornelius's mind replayed the scene in the tavern. Petros's hollow laugh. The crowd's shifting anger. The way his perfect theory had disintegrated under a single piece of contradictory evidence.

He had been so sure.

And he had been so wrong.

"What do we do now?" Zeph asked quietly.

Cornelius folded his wings tighter.

"I do not know," he said.

And it was the truest thing he had said all morning.

# Chapter 11

# Chapter 11

The book belonged on the third shelf, not the fourth.

Cornelius pulled it free and carried it to its proper location, sliding it into place with a soft *thunk* of leather against leather. The alignment was perfect now. Spines flush. Heights descending from left to right in precise increments.

Order.

He moved to the next shelf.

This section cataloged maritime trade agreements from the previous century. Someone—probably a patron during the Feast—had reshelf a volume on fishing rights between two volumes on harbor taxes. The error made his wings itch.

Cornelius removed all three books, arranged them properly on the floor, and began replacing them in correct chronological order.

His claws moved with mechanical precision. Lift. Place. Align. Check.

The rhythm was soothing.

The rhythm did not require thinking about the Golden Amphora.

Did not require remembering Petros's hollow laugh or the crowd's shifting anger or the way his perfect theory had disintegrated like wet parchment under a single contradictory fact.

Lift. Place. Align. Check.

The books did not care that he had humiliated himself publicly. The books did not whisper about foreign dragons who played detective and accused innocent men of murder. The books simply existed in their proper places, waiting to be shelved correctly.

Cornelius finished the maritime section and moved to the next row.

Philosophy. Ethics. Moral treatises from the Third Reformation.

Two volumes were backwards. Spines facing the wall instead of the aisle.

Unacceptable.

He pulled them free, turned them around, and reshelf them with the same mechanical care. The texture of old leather under his claws was familiar. Safe. Predictable.

Unlike evidence.

Unlike witnesses.

Unlike his own catastrophically flawed deductions.

Cornelius's tail lashed.

The motion knocked a small stack of reference cards off the shelf. They scattered across the floor in a spray of cream-colored parchment.

He stared at them.

Disorder.

His fault.

Always his fault when things fell apart.

He gathered the cards carefully, checking each one for damage, and restacked them in alphabetical order by subject heading. The edges aligned perfectly. He set the stack back on the shelf and adjusted it until it sat at a precise right angle to the shelf edge.

Better.

But the next shelf was a mess too. Books leaning at odd angles. Gaps where volumes had been removed and never replaced. Dust coating the upper corners.

How had he let it get this bad?

How had he let *anything* get this bad?

Cornelius pulled every book from the shelf and began again.

Alphabetical by author. Then chronological within each author's works. Then checked for damage. Then reshelf with spines aligned and heights descending.

The process took fifteen minutes.

It should have taken five.

But his claws kept trembling.

"Okay, that's it."

Zeph's voice cut through the mechanical rhythm like a badly tuned lyre string.

Cornelius did not look up from the shelf. "I am working."

"You're hiding." Footsteps approached across the stone floor. "You've been in here for like three hours."

"I am cataloging. The stacks were in disarray. Proper archival maintenance requires—"

"You're freaking out."

Cornelius's wings flared. "I am *organizing*. There is a difference."

"Yeah? What shelf are you on?"

Cornelius glanced at the label. "Political Theory. Subsection: Governance Models. Third Era."

"And what was the last shelf you did?"

"Maritime Trade. Subsection: Fishing Rights and Harbor—" Cornelius stopped.

That shelf was four rows away.

In a completely different section.

With an entirely different cataloging system.

He had been moving randomly through the stacks, fixing whatever caught his eye, with no systematic plan or logical progression.

The realization made his scales itch.

"You skipped like six whole sections," Zeph said quietly. "You're just... grabbing whatever's closest and making it perfect. Over and over."

Cornelius set down the book he was holding. His claws left small indentations in the leather cover. "The library was in disorder. I was correcting the errors."

"The library's fine. You're the one who's a mess."

The words hit harder than they should have.

Cornelius turned away, focusing on the next shelf. More philosophy. A gap where someone had removed a volume on ethical frameworks and never returned it. He could check the circulation log. Track down the borrower. Demand the book's return.

Except the library was sealed.

And he was not supposed to be inside.

And the circulation logs would not change the fact that he had publicly accused an innocent man of murder based on incomplete evidence and arrogant certainty.

His tail coiled tight around his hindclaws.

"I made an error," Cornelius said. His voice sounded strange. Flat. "A significant error. In public. With witnesses. I followed a logical chain to an incorrect conclusion and presented it as irrefutable fact."

"Yeah." Zeph leaned against the shelf. "You did."

"I humiliated myself. Damaged my credibility. Proved Captain Melas correct in his assessment that I am merely a librarian overstepping my competence." Cornelius's claws flexed against the stone floor. "I demonstrated precisely the kind of intellectual arrogance that leads to catastrophic failure."

"Okay, but—"

"I accused Petros Kallistos of conspiracy and murder when he was physically incapable of committing the crime. I ignored the possibility of alternate explanations. I constructed a theory that confirmed my own assumptions and dismissed evidence that contradicted it." The words tumbled out faster now. Harsher. "I behaved like an amateur. Like someone playing at investigation without understanding the discipline required. Like—"

"Like someone who's scared he screwed up so bad nobody'll ever trust him again?"

Cornelius went very still.

Zeph pushed off from the shelf and moved closer. "Look. You messed up. Yeah. It was bad. But you're not the first person to follow evidence to the wrong place. Happens all the time. You just... gotta step back and look at it different."

"I was *certain*." Cornelius's voice cracked slightly on the word. "The handwriting matched. The note was in Petros's hand. The schematic was in his possession. Every piece of evidence pointed to him as the insider providing access to co-conspirators. The logical chain was sound."

"Except it wasn't."

"Except it was not." Cornelius's wings drooped. "Which means my methodology is flawed. My deductive process is unreliable. I cannot trust my own conclusions."

"Or maybe you just missed something." Zeph crouched down until he was at eye level with Cornelius. "You told me once that the point of documentation is to catch errors. To have a record you can check when your memory's wrong. Right?"

Cornelius nodded slowly.

"So check it." Zeph gestured back toward the main library. "You got all the evidence written down. All the stuff you found. Go back and look at it like you're reading someone else's notes. See what you missed."

"I do not wish to relive my failure in exacting detail."

"Too bad. You're doing it anyway." Zeph stood and held out a hand. "Come on. Before you reorganize the entire philosophy section for no reason."

Cornelius stared at the offered hand.

Then at the stacks around him. Shelves in perfect order. Books aligned with geometric precision. Everything controlled. Everything safe.

Everything meaningless if he could not solve the case that had violated his sanctuary.

He placed his claw in Zeph's palm.

The boy pulled him to his feet and led him out of the stacks, past the reading tables, toward the circulation desk where Cornelius's private ledger sat tucked in the bottom drawer.

The library felt different now. Quieter. Emptier.

Or perhaps that was just the weight of failure pressing down on everything.

Cornelius retrieved his ledger and carried it to the nearest table. The leather cover was worn smooth from handling. Inside, pages of careful notes documented every step of the investigation.

He opened to the first entry.

*Spring Feast, Day One. Dread Level: Moderate.*

It felt like a lifetime ago.

Zeph pulled up a chair and sat backwards on it, arms folded over the back. "Okay. Start from the beginning. What did you actually know? Not what you thought. What did you *see*?"

Cornelius forced himself to focus on the words instead of the shame.

"Elias arrived with a package. Nervous. Sweating. The package smelled of lapis lazuli powder and machine oil. He claimed it contained sentimental correspondence from Eudora of Naxos."

"Evidence of lying?"

"The smell. Lapis and oil are consistent with alchemical reagents or locksmithing materials. Not correspondence."

"But you don't know what was in the package."

"No. It was stolen before I could examine it." Cornelius turned the page. "Later, I observed Sophia Doukas arguing with Elias in the market. She referenced wards, a sequence, and withheld payment until a task was completed."

"So she hired him for something."

"That was my assumption." Cornelius's claw traced the words. "But the conversation could also be interpreted as her *pressuring* him about a task someone else had hired him for. Or negotiating terms for a separate commission entirely."

Zeph leaned forward. "What else?"

"The blue thread on Sister Photine's sandal matched the thread on Sophia's dress hem. I concluded they were connected through shared resources or direct interaction." Cornelius paused. "But thread is not unique. Multiple tailors likely use the same suppliers. The connection is circumstantial."

"Keep going."

Cornelius flipped to the next page. The entry about the handkerchief.

"Sophia carried a handkerchief monogrammed with 'P' that smelled of lilac and turpentine. I interpreted this as evidence of a personal connection to Petros Kallistos, since lilac is his preferred scent."

"And the turpentine?"

"Doukas workshop. Tile glazes and cleaning solutions." Cornelius's tail twitched. "I assumed the dual scents meant Sophia and Petros had been in close physical proximity. Possibly romantic involvement."

"But?"

"But a handkerchief can be borrowed. Stolen. Found. The monogram could belong to someone else entirely. Photine's name begins with P." Cornelius's claws tightened on the ledger edge. "I saw what I expected to see. A secret alliance between rival houses. A conspiracy. I constructed a narrative that fit my assumptions."

Zeph was quiet for a moment. Then: "Okay. But some of that stuff's still true, yeah? Elias *was* lying about the package. Sophia *did* argue with him. The vault *was* robbed."

"Yes."

"So the evidence isn't wrong. Just your explanation of how it connects."

Cornelius turned to the page about the vault code note.

*Vault Code: 4-4-9. Delivery: Third Fourthday, dawn. Payment on completion. Burn this.*

Written in Petros's distinctive, sloppy hand.

"This note was the keystone of my theory," Cornelius said. "Proof that Petros had provided the vault access to co-conspirators. Clear evidence of premeditation and conspiracy."

"Except Petros said Elias asked him to write it."

"While Petros was drunk. Weeks before the theft." Cornelius stared at the words. "I assumed Petros wrote it for Sophia. But what if Elias *solicited* it? What if Elias was the one planning the robbery, and he manipulated Petros into providing the code?"

Zeph's eyes widened. "Holy shit."

"Elias owed money to Mago. Needed a big score. Told Mago he had a 'Kallistos gold' job lined up." Cornelius's mind was moving faster now. Pieces rearranging. "What if Elias was not the expendable courier? What if he was the *planner*?"

"But then who killed him?"

Cornelius turned to a blank page and began writing.

"Assume Elias planned the theft. He needed access to the vault—obtained by manipulating Petros into writing the code. He needed tools to breach the wards—obtained by having Eudora send the package to the vault under false pretenses. He needed a map of the ventilation system—obtained from... whom?"

Zeph frowned. "The schematic was in Petros's lap when we found him."

"Planted there. While he was unconscious." Cornelius wrote faster. "Someone wanted us to think Petros was involved. Wanted the Watch to investigate him instead of the actual conspirators."

"So Elias had a partner."

"Yes." Cornelius's tail uncurled slightly. "Someone with technical expertise. Someone who could draft a detailed ventilation schematic. Someone who knew enough about the library's wards to plan a bypass."

"Sophia?"

"Possibly. She has access to alchemical materials through the tile workshop. She argued with Elias about a task and payment. The timeline fits." Cornelius tapped his claw against the page. "But there is another possibility."

"Who?"

"Alexandros Doukas." Cornelius flipped back to his earlier notes. "Observed at the rear delivery alley, wearing heavy leather gloves in warm weather. Intercepted Eudora when she came to inquire about the package. Steered her away from further questions."

Zeph leaned over the ledger. "You think he and Elias were working together?"

"I think Elias approached someone who could provide technical expertise and alchemical materials. Someone who needed access to the Kallistos correspondence for political or financial leverage. They planned the theft together." Cornelius wrote the names in two columns. "Elias obtained the vault code and delivery access. His partner provided the tools and the plan. They split the stolen documents."

"And then what? The partner killed Elias?"

"Or Elias got greedy. Tried to renegotiate the split. Threatened to expose his partner unless he received a larger share." Cornelius's claws moved across the page, connecting lines between pieces of evidence. "The partnership soured. One of them deployed the poison. The other ended up dead in the vault."

Zeph whistled softly. "Okay. So... how do we prove it?"

Cornelius stared at the diagram he had sketched. Names. Connections. Question marks where evidence was thin.

It was not perfect.

But it was not *wrong*.

Not built on assumptions and arrogance.

Built on documented observations and alternate possibilities.

"We need to know what was in the package," Cornelius said finally. "Eudora sent it. She knows what it contained. If we can determine the nature of the tool used to breach the vault, we can trace it back to whoever provided it."

"Eudora wouldn't talk to you before."

"Because I approached her as an investigator. Asking questions she refused to answer." Cornelius's wings rustled. "But she *did* express concern about the package's value. She wanted compensation."

"So?"

"So we approach her as a fellow victim. Someone who lost valuable property in the theft." Cornelius closed the ledger carefully. "We offer information about the investigation in exchange for information about the package. A trade. Mutual benefit."

Zeph grinned. "You want to *gossip* with her."

"I want to conduct a strategic exchange of relevant intelligence."

"That's gossip."

Cornelius's tail swished with irritation, but there was no real heat behind it. The frantic, spiraling shame had receded. Replaced by something cooler. Clearer.

Purpose.

"If Eudora hired Elias to deliver the package, she may know who else Elias was working with. Financial records. Correspondence. Witnesses to their interactions." Cornelius stood, gathering the ledger against his chest. "She is the connection between Elias and whoever provided the vault-breaking tool. If we can convince her to share that information—"

"We find the partner," Zeph finished. "And the partner's probably the killer."

"Precisely."

Zeph pushed back from the table and stood. "So we're doing this? Going back to talk to the person who already told you to screw off once?"

Cornelius adjusted his spectacles. "I am doing this. You may remain here if you prefer. After my public failure at the Golden Amphora, I would understand if you wished to distance yourself from—"

"Dude. Shut up." Zeph crossed his arms. "I don't care if you messed up. You're still gonna solve this thing. You just gotta stop being so sure you're right before you actually prove it."

The words should have stung.

Instead, they settled like a weight Cornelius had been carrying without realizing. Heavy. But not crushing.

True.

"I will endeavor to maintain appropriate skepticism regarding my own conclusions," Cornelius said carefully.

"Great. Now let's go bug Eudora until she tells us what was in that package." Zeph headed toward the rear delivery entrance, the same route they had used to sneak in. "You think she's still in town? Or did she bail after the theft?"

"She demanded compensation. She will not leave until she receives it or confirms its impossibility." Cornelius followed, ledger tucked securely under one wing. "Merchants do not abandon potential profit easily."

They reached the rear door. Zeph cracked it open and checked the alley.

"Clear."

They slipped out into the narrow space between buildings. The Spring Feast crowds were audible in the distance—voices and music and the clatter of commerce. But here, in the shadowed gap behind the library, the world was quiet.

Cornelius paused at the threshold and looked back at the stone wall.

His sanctuary. His hoard.

Still sealed by the Watch. Still technically forbidden to him.

But no longer a place of retreat and shame.

A place to think. To organize. To find the patterns hidden in chaos.

He had been wrong about Petros.

But he was not wrong about everything.

Someone had stolen from the library. Someone had killed Elias. Someone had violated the sanctuary and thought they could escape consequences.

And Cornelius Drake, Curator and Guardian, was going to prove exactly who that someone was.

With documentation.

With evidence.

And this time, with appropriate epistemic humility.

He turned away from the library and followed Zeph into the alley, toward the harbor district and the merchant houses where Eudora of Naxos kept her offices.

The case was not solved.

But it was not over either.

# Chapter 12

# Chapter 12

The market square was *loud*.

Cornelius stood at the edge of the Loggia and resisted the urge to turn around and retreat to the library's silent stone sanctuary. The Spring Feast had transformed the orderly plaza into a riot of color and noise. Merchants shouted over each other. Musicians competed for attention from opposite corners. The smell of frying dough and roasted meat hung thick in the air.

And somewhere in this chaos, Eudora of Naxos was conducting business.

"There." Zeph pointed toward a fabric merchant's stall near the fountain. "Blue dress. Carrying the leather case."

Cornelius's eyes followed the direction. Yes. Eudora stood at a pigment seller's table, examining small clay jars with the focused intensity of someone evaluating expensive merchandise.

"She is purchasing supplies," Cornelius observed. "Interesting."

"Why's that interesting?"

"Because she claimed her missing package was irreplaceable. Yet here she is, replacing it." Cornelius adjusted his spectacles and started forward. "Come. We have questions."

The crowd pressed close as they moved through the square. Bodies jostled. Feet stomped dangerously near Cornelius's tail. Someone's basket caught on his wing and he had to pull free with a sharp tug that left his scales bristling.

This entire festival was a violation of proper spatial organization.

They reached the pigment seller's stall just as Eudora was handing over a small purse of coins. The merchant—a weathered woman with blue-stained hands—wrapped three clay jars in cloth and placed them carefully in Eudora's leather case.

"Eudora of Naxos," Cornelius said.

The woman turned. Her expression shifted from neutral transaction mode to cold recognition in the space of a heartbeat.

"You." She closed the leather case with a sharp *snap*. "I told you I would speak only to the Watch."

"And I have new information that may assist in recovering your property." Cornelius kept his voice level. Professional. "Specifically regarding Elias of Tyre's final movements before his death."

Eudora's hand tightened on the case handle. "I am busy."

"This will take only a moment. Unless you prefer I share my findings with Captain Melas first, and allow him to draw his own conclusions about your involvement?"

It was a bluff. Cornelius had no intention of returning to Theo with incomplete information and risking another public humiliation. But Eudora did not know that.

Her jaw tightened. "One moment. Not here."

She gestured toward a quieter corner of the square, away from the main flow of foot traffic. Cornelius followed, Zeph trailing behind.

When they were out of immediate earshot of the crowd, Eudora stopped and turned to face them. "What do you want?"

"I want to know what was in the package you sent to the Kallistos vault."

"I already told you—"

"You told me it was private. You demanded compensation. You showed no grief when I informed you Elias was dead." Cornelius's tail swished. "But you did not tell me what the package actually contained. And I believe that information is relevant to determining who killed your courier."

Eudora's expression flickered. Something that might have been fear or calculation or simply exhaustion.

"Why should I tell you anything?" she asked. "You are not the Watch. You have no authority."

"No. But I am the Curator of the library where your courier died. And I have access to records and observations Captain Melas does not." Cornelius folded his wings carefully. "I know Elias was in debt to Mago Hanno. I know he told Mago he had a 'Kallistos gold' job that would clear his debts. I know he delivered your package to the vault the day before he died."

Eudora went very still.

"What I do not know," Cornelius continued, "is what you paid him to deliver. Or why it was valuable enough to justify the risk of placing it in a warded vault."

The silence stretched between them. Market noise swirled around the quiet corner but Eudora's attention was fixed entirely on Cornelius now.

"It was not valuable," she said finally. Her voice was flat. Defeated. "Not the way you think."

"Explain."

Eudora glanced at Zeph, then back to Cornelius. "If I tell you, it stays between us. Not the Watch. Not the Council. Not House Kallistos."

"I cannot promise—"

"Then we are done." She turned to leave.

"Wait." Cornelius's claws scraped against stone. He hated bargaining. Hated dealing in conditional truths and partial disclosures. But he needed this information. "I will keep your confidence unless it directly implicates you in Elias's death or the vault theft."

Eudora studied him for a long moment. Then her shoulders sagged slightly. "It was a formula. A glaze formula."

Cornelius's wings rustled. "For tiles."

"Yes. Kallistos blue. The exact combination of lapis, copper oxide, and flux that gives their tiles that specific color. Their grandfather developed it forty years ago and they have kept it locked in the family vault ever since." Eudora's hand tightened on the leather case. "I paid Elias to steal it for me."

The market noise seemed to fade slightly. Cornelius's mind raced, cataloging implications.

Industrial espionage.

Not blackmail. Not political leverage. Not family secrets.

*Tile glaze*.

"You hired him to commit theft," Cornelius said carefully.

"I hired him to retrieve a formula that should never have been locked away in the first place." There was heat in Eudora's voice now. Bitterness. "House Kallistos has controlled the luxury tile market for decades because of that blue. They price their work at triple what anyone else can charge. They refuse to license the formula. They strangle competition."

"So you decided to steal it."

"I decided to *acquire* it through an independent contractor and level the market." Eudora lifted her chin. "Elias said he had a contact who could get him into the vault. Someone who owed him a favor. He promised me the formula by sunset on Thirdday. I was to meet him at the Broken Mast tavern and pay him the second half of his fee."

"But he never arrived."

"No. He did not." Eudora's expression hardened. "I waited three hours. Then I heard the rumors about a body in the library vault. I assumed he had been caught. Arrested. I did not know he was dead until you told me."

Cornelius's claws flexed against stone. The timeline was tightening. Elias had died sometime between delivering the package on Secondday afternoon and the scheduled sunset meeting on Thirdday.

"The package you sent," Cornelius said. "What did it contain?"

"Payment. Half up front, as agreed. Fifty silver crescents sewn into the lining of a correspondence folder." Eudora's voice was bitter. "Marked for the Kallistos vault to avoid suspicion. Elias was supposed to retrieve the formula, take his payment from the package, and bring me the documents."

"But the package was stolen along with the Kallistos correspondence."

"So I lost both my money and my formula." Eudora's hand moved to the leather case at her side. "Which is why I am buying lapis from a market stall instead of commissioning proper pigment from Naxos. Because I spent my capital on a failed theft and now I am trying to reverse-engineer the damn formula myself."

The pieces were rearranging in Cornelius's mind. Not a conspiracy between rival houses. Not Petros and Sophia working together.

Eudora hiring Elias to steal the Kallistos glaze formula.

Elias promising her success and taking half the payment up front.

Elias dying before he could complete the delivery.

"Who was his contact?" Cornelius asked. "The person who was supposed to help him access the vault?"

"He never told me. Said it was safer if I did not know." Eudora shook her head. "I assumed it was someone in House Kallistos. A servant with access to the vault codes. Or maybe one of the junior family members who needed money."

Cornelius thought of Petros slumped in his chair at the Golden Amphora. Drunk. Broken. Insisting he had only written the vault code because Elias asked him to while he was too plastered to think straight.

Was that the truth? Or had Petros been lying about the extent of his involvement?

No.

Petros had been in the Watch drunk tank the night of the theft. Captain Melas could verify that alibi with a single records check.

Which meant Elias's "contact" was someone else.

Someone who had access to the vault system. Knowledge of the wards. The technical skill to breach the seals.

Someone who had killed Elias when the partnership went wrong.

"The jars you just purchased," Cornelius said, gesturing toward the leather case. "Lapis pigment?"

"And copper oxide and silica flux." Eudora's voice was tired. "I am trying to replicate the formula through experimentation. It will take months. Maybe years. And I will never achieve the exact shade. But it is all I have left."

"You are committing the same theft. Simply using a different method."

"I am conducting research." Eudora's eyes were hard. "House Kallistos does not own the *concept* of blue glaze. Only their specific formulation. If I develop my own variant through independent testing, there is no theft."

It was a technical distinction. A legal fiction.

But Cornelius could not argue with her underlying point. Knowledge locked in vaults and hoarded by families *was* a perversion of how information should flow.

He just wished it had not resulted in murder.

"If you think of anything else about Elias's contact," Cornelius said, "any detail he mentioned about how he planned to access the vault—"

"I will tell the Watch." Eudora adjusted her grip on the case. "Not you. I have already said too much to a dragon with no legal authority and a reputation for public accusations."

The words hit harder than they should have.

Cornelius's wings folded tight against his back. "I am attempting to solve a murder."

"You are attempting to salvage your pride." Eudora's voice was not unkind. Just matter-of-fact. "I understand the impulse. But I will not risk my business or my freedom on your amateur investigation. If you discover the killer, bring your evidence to Captain Melas. Let the Watch do their job."

She turned and walked back toward the market crowds, leather case held close to her side.

Cornelius stood frozen. The noise of the Feast pressed in around him. Vendors shouting. Musicians playing. Laughter and argument and the constant shuffle of feet across stone.

Amateur investigation.

Salvaging pride.

Public accusations.

His claws scraped against the ground.

"Well," Zeph said from beside him. "That was... something."

Cornelius forced himself to move. To think. To process the new information instead of dwelling on Eudora's assessment of his competence.

"She hired Elias to steal the glaze formula," he said. His voice sounded clipped even to his own ears. "Industrial espionage. Not political blackmail or family secrets. Simply a trade formula."

"Yeah. I got that part." Zeph shifted his weight. "So... what now?"

"Now we determine who Elias's contact was. The person who actually committed the vault breach." Cornelius's mind was already racing through possibilities. "Someone with technical knowledge. Access to alchemical materials. Familiarity with the library's ward system."

"The Doukas family?"

"Possibly. Sophia has the workshop access. Alexandros has demonstrated suspicious behavior." Cornelius started walking back toward the main square, thoughts churning. "We need to cross-reference their movements against the timeline. Determine who had opportunity during the critical window between—"

"Whoa. Hey. Cornelius."

Cornelius stopped. Turned.

Zeph was not following. He stood at the edge of the quieter corner, hands shoved in his pockets, expression uncertain.

"What is wrong?" Cornelius asked.

"Nothing's *wrong*. Just... we've been running around all day. Chasing down Eudora. Cataloging evidence. Rebuilding theories." Zeph gestured vaguely toward the Feast crowds. "Can we maybe take a break? Like, five minutes to just... exist?"

"This is a murder investigation. There is no time for—"

"There's musicians over there." Zeph pointed toward the fountain where a group of performers had set up drums and string instruments. "And I haven't eaten anything except those dry rolls you packed this morning. And the Feast only happens once a year and I'm supposed to be enjoying it, not spending every second being your assistant."

The words stung.

Cornelius's tail coiled. "I did not realize my investigation was such an imposition."

"That's not what I meant—"

"You are free to leave at any time. I have never forced you to participate in this inquiry." Cornelius's wings rustled with irritation. "If you would prefer to spend your afternoon listening to badly tuned lyres and eating fried dough, I will not stop you."

Zeph's expression hardened. "You know what? Fine. Yeah. I'll do that."

"Excellent. I will continue pursuing actual leads while you indulge in frivolous—"

"God, do you even *hear* yourself?" Zeph's voice rose slightly. Not quite shouting but loud enough that a few passersby glanced over. "You're doing it again. Acting like you're the only one who cares about solving this. Like everyone else is just stupid or lazy for wanting to take five minutes to breathe."

"I am simply maintaining focus on the relevant—"

"You're obsessing. Same as when you were reorganizing the stacks for three hours." Zeph crossed his arms. "You mess up once and now you're trying to prove you're the smartest person in the room by working yourself into the ground. And you're dragging me with you."

"I am not dragging anyone. You chose to—"

"I chose to help because I thought we were partners. Not because I wanted to be your errand boy while you chase down the next theory that's probably gonna fall apart just like the Petros thing."

The market noise seemed very loud suddenly.

Cornelius stood perfectly still, wings folded, tail coiled tight around his hindclaws.

"If you have so little faith in my investigative abilities," he said quietly, "then perhaps you should not waste your time assisting me further."

Zeph stared at him. Something that might have been hurt flickered across his face before hardening into anger.

"You know what? You're right. I'm gonna go waste my time somewhere else." He turned and started walking toward the fountain where the musicians were playing. "Have fun solving the case all by yourself."

"Zeph—"

But the boy was already gone, swallowed by the crowd of Feast-goers clustered around the performers.

Cornelius stood alone at the edge of the square.

People flowed around him. Merchants hawked their wares. The scent of fried pastries and grilled meat hung thick in the air. Someone nearby was arguing about the price of silk. A child laughed. A dog barked.

The world continued its chaotic spin, indifferent to the small dragon standing frozen in the middle of it all.

He should go after Zeph. Apologize. Explain that he was not trying to be dismissive or controlling, he was simply—

Simply what?

Terrified of failing again?

Desperate to prove he was competent despite the humiliation at the Golden Amphora?

Using the investigation as a way to avoid thinking about how thoroughly he had misjudged Petros and exposed his own arrogance?

Cornelius's claws flexed against stone.

Zeph was right. He was obsessing. Chasing leads without pause. Treating every interaction as another step toward vindication instead of... what? Collaboration? Partnership?

He should apologize.

He turned toward the fountain, scanning the crowd for Zeph's distinctive bronze-sheened hair.

There. Near the musicians. Standing with a small group of teenagers who were clapping along to the drumbeat.

Zeph's shoulders were relaxed. He was smiling. Laughing at something one of the other kids said.

He looked lighter. Happier.

Free of the weight of Cornelius's obsessive investigation.

Cornelius watched him for a long moment. Then turned away.

Zeph deserved a break. Deserved to enjoy the Feast like a normal teenager instead of being dragged through markets and interrogations and the meticulous reconstruction of murder timelines.

And Cornelius could continue the investigation alone. He had done it for days before bringing Zeph more officially into the inquiry. He could manage a few more hours.

He would apologize later. After he had made real progress. After he had something concrete to show for all the running around and questioning.

After he had proven that his methods *worked*.

Cornelius adjusted his spectacles and started walking.

Not toward the library—still sealed by the Watch.

Not toward the Doukas estate—he had already questioned Sophia and learned what he could from that angle.

Toward his small rented room above the cartographer's shop. Where his private ledger waited. Where he could sit and think and organize the new information without the chaos of the Feast pressing in around him.

The walk took fifteen minutes through crowded streets and narrow alleys. The noise faded gradually as he moved away from the main square. By the time he reached the quiet side street where the cartographer's shop sat wedged between a bookbinder and a pottery merchant, the only sound was the distant murmur of the Feast crowds and the soft *tap tap tap* of his claws on cobblestones.

He climbed the exterior stairs to his second-floor room. Unlocked the door with the small key he kept on a chain around his neck. Stepped inside.

The room was exactly as he had left it this morning. Narrow bed with precisely tucked corners. Writing desk positioned beneath the window for optimal natural light—not that he cared about sunlight, but the position allowed for good air circulation. Bookshelf organized by subject and author.

Order.

Quiet.

*Empty*.

Cornelius closed the door behind him and moved to the writing desk. He pulled out his private ledger and opened it to a blank page.

*New Information: Eudora of Naxos hired Elias to steal the Kallistos glaze formula. Payment was fifty silver crescents hidden in the correspondence folder. Elias promised delivery by sunset, Thirdday. He never arrived for the meeting.*

Cornelius's claw traced the words.

So. Not blackmail. Not political leverage.

Industrial espionage.

A tile formula locked in a family vault.

Elias promising to steal it. Taking payment up front. Recruiting a contact who could actually breach the wards.

And then dying before he could complete the delivery.

Which meant either the contact had killed him and taken the formula for themselves, or Elias had died in the vault breach itself and the contact had fled.

Or—

Or Elias had never intended to split the profits. Had planned to cut out his contact and sell the formula to Eudora alone. And the contact had discovered the betrayal and responded with poison.

Cornelius added another line to his notes.

*Possible motive: Elias double-crossing his partner.*

It fit. Elias had gambling debts. Needed money desperately. Eudora was offering enough silver to clear his debt to Mago and leave him with a comfortable surplus.

What if Elias had decided he did not need to share that windfall?

What if he had planned to take the formula and disappear, leaving his contact with nothing?

And what if the contact had learned of the betrayal and taken preemptive action?

Cornelius stared at the page.

It was logical. Internally consistent. Supported by the evidence.

But it was also unfalsifiable without knowing the identity of Elias's contact.

Which brought him back to the same question he had been circling since the beginning.

*Who had the technical knowledge to breach the vault wards?*

Sophia Doukas.

Alexandros Doukas.

Someone else entirely.

Cornelius's claws tapped against the desk.

He needed more information. Needed to verify Sophia's movements during the critical timeframe. Needed to confirm whether Alexandros had access to alchemical materials and vault-breaking expertise.

Needed—

Needed Zeph.

The thought arrived unbidden and unwelcome.

Zeph, who could move through crowds without drawing attention. Who had family connections throughout the merchant district. Who could ask casual questions without triggering the defensive suspicion that a small dragon investigator provoked.

Zeph, who was currently at the Feast square, enjoying music and fried dough and the company of people who were not obsessively cataloging evidence.

Cornelius closed the ledger.

The room felt very quiet suddenly.

Very empty.

He had been alone before. Preferred it, even. Solitude was conducive to focus. To deep thought. To the kind of intellectual work that required freedom from distraction.

But this felt different.

This felt like isolation.

Cornelius stood and moved to the window. From here he could see a sliver of the harbor district. Ships at anchor. The distant movement of dockworkers loading cargo.

Somewhere beyond his line of sight, the Feast continued. Music and laughter and the joyful chaos of a city celebrating spring.

And somewhere in that chaos, Zeph was probably having a good time. Making friends. Being a normal teenager instead of an amateur investigator's reluctant assistant.

Cornelius's wings folded tight against his back.

He should not have snapped. Should not have dismissed Zeph's desire for a break as frivolous. Should not have framed the investigation as more important than Zeph's legitimate need to simply *exist* for a few minutes without the weight of murder and theft and failure pressing down.

He would apologize.

Tomorrow.

After he had made progress. After he had something to show for pushing forward alone.

After he could prove that his obsessive focus was not just pride but professionalism.

Cornelius turned away from the window and returned to the desk.

He opened the ledger again and began writing. Organizing. Cataloging every piece of evidence he had gathered. Every observation. Every deduction.

Building a case that would withstand scrutiny. That would prove beyond doubt who had killed Elias of Tyre and stolen from the Kallistos vault.

Building it alone.

In the quiet.

Where no one could see him fail again.

# Chapter 13

# Chapter 13

The walk back from the market square took Cornelius past the public baths.

He had not intended to go this route. The direct path to his rented room led through the merchant quarter, not the bath district. But the merchant quarter meant crowds. Meant vendors who might recognize him from the Golden Amphora incident. Meant the possibility of encountering Petros Kallistos or his house guards or simply more people who would see a small dragon walking alone and remember his very public failure.

So Cornelius had taken the long way. The quiet way.

The side streets near the baths were nearly empty. Most citizens were still at the Feast. The few who were not had retreated indoors for evening meals or early rest. The stone beneath Cornelius's claws was smooth here. Old. Worn down by centuries of foot traffic leading to and from the bath complex.

He moved carefully, tail lifted to avoid dragging across the uneven surfaces.

The alley between the bath's south wall and a row of shuttered shops was darker than he had expected. The buildings blocked most of the ambient light from the market district. Only a single oil lamp flickered near the bath entrance, casting long shadows that shifted with each gust of wind from the harbor.

Cornelius paused at the alley's mouth.

His scales prickled.

Not the deep, instinctual *hoard-threat* warning he had felt at the vault. Something different. Smaller. The physical sensation of being watched.

He scanned the alley. Empty. Just stone walls and closed doors and the faint steam rising from the bath's ventilation grates.

Paranoia. He was being paranoid.

A natural reaction after the humiliation at the Golden Amphora. After the argument with Zeph. After spending hours alone in his room, cataloging evidence and building theories with no one to check his work or point out the flaws in his reasoning.

He was jumpy. Anxious. Seeing threats where none existed.

Cornelius forced himself forward into the alley.

His claws clicked against stone. The sound echoed off the walls. Too loud. Too obvious.

He was halfway through when the figure stepped out from the recessed doorway.

Cornelius froze.

The man was tall. Well-dressed. Dark hair pulled back from a face that was handsome in the sharp, careful way of someone who had never lacked for wealth or status.

Alexandros Doukas.

"Curator Drake." The voice was smooth. Pleasant. "Walking alone this evening?"

Cornelius's wings pressed tight against his back. His mind raced through options. The alley was narrow. Stone walls on both sides. The only exits were behind him—back toward the market square—or ahead, past Alexandros, toward the residential quarter.

"Alexandros." Cornelius kept his voice level. Professional. "I was not aware we had an appointment."

"We do not." Alexandros moved forward two steps. Not aggressive. Just... present. Filling the space. "I simply happened to see you pass and thought we might have a brief conversation."

"About?"

"Your investigation."

The word hung in the air between them.

Cornelius's claws flexed against stone. "I am not conducting an investigation. The Watch has jurisdiction over Elias of Tyre's death and the vault theft. I have cooperated fully with their inquiries."

"Have you?" Alexandros tilted his head slightly. The gesture was curious. Almost friendly. "Because I have heard otherwise. I have heard you have been asking questions. Making inquiries. Approaching members of prominent families with rather pointed accusations."

Petros. He meant the scene at the Golden Amphora.

Or Eudora. Who had probably spoken to someone after their market square confrontation.

Or Sophia, who had certainly told her family about Cornelius's visit to the Doukas estate.

"I am attempting to recover stolen property from my library," Cornelius said carefully. "That is within my authority as Curator."

"Your *sealed* library." Alexandros's smile did not reach his eyes. "The one Captain Melas has declared a crime scene. The one you are legally barred from entering."

"Temporarily."

"Ah. Temporarily." Alexandros took another step forward.

Cornelius became acutely aware of the size differential.

Alexandros was not a large man by human standards. Average height. Lean build. But he was still a *man*. Adult. Fully grown.

And Cornelius was a dragon the size of a house cat.

Twelve pounds of scales and wings and claws that were sharp enough to draw blood but not strong enough to stop a determined human from simply picking him up and snapping his neck.

The realization sent a cold spike of fear through his chest.

"I think we both know," Alexandros continued, "that you are not simply waiting for the Watch to conclude their work. You are pursuing your own theories. Building your own case. Playing detective."

Eudora's words. Almost exactly.

*You are attempting to salvage your pride.*

Cornelius's tail coiled tighter. "I am ensuring that the library's security has not been compromised. That is my responsibility."

"Your responsibility is to catalog books." Alexandros's voice was still pleasant. Still calm. "Not to harass merchants. Not to interrogate members of established houses. Not to make wild accusations about theft and murder based on circumstantial evidence and your own overinflated sense of intellectual superiority."

The words hit like physical blows.

Cornelius forced himself not to step backward. Not to show weakness.

"If you have concerns about my conduct," he said stiffly, "I suggest you bring them to the Curator's Guild or the Council. I answer to both."

"Do you?" Alexandros moved again. Closer. "Because from where I stand, you answer to no one. You are a foreign dragon with a Guild charter who has been given entirely too much autonomy and entirely too much undeserved respect."

*Foreign dragon.*

The phrase echoed the mutters from the Golden Amphora. The dismissive glances from merchants who saw him as an outsider. An interloper. Someone who did not truly belong in Solterra Bay despite his years of service to the library.

"The Charter grants me—"

"The Charter grants you custodial authority over a civic institution. It does not grant you investigative powers. It does not make you an agent of the law." Alexandros stopped less than two body-lengths away. "And it certainly does not give you the right to interfere in family business."

Cornelius's scales prickled again. Harder now.

The hoard-threat instinct was screaming at him. Not because his books were in danger. Because *he* was in danger.

"I have interfered in nothing," Cornelius said. His voice came out steadier than he felt. "I have asked questions relevant to a crime committed in my library. That is all."

"You have made yourself a nuisance." Alexandros's pleasant expression did not change. "And nuisances have a way of experiencing unfortunate accidents. Especially during the Feast when the city is crowded and the Watch is stretched thin."

The threat was delivered in the same calm, conversational tone Alexandros might use to discuss the weather or the price of tiles.

Cornelius's wings flared involuntarily. A defensive posture. Instinctive. Useless against someone Alexandros's size.

"Are you threatening me?" Cornelius asked.

"I am offering friendly advice." Alexandros spread his hands. The gesture was open. Unthreatening. "You are a valued member of the community, Curator Drake. It would be terrible if something happened to you. A fall from a high shelf, perhaps. Or an unfortunate encounter with a drunk sailor in a dark alley. These things happen during festivals. Chaos breeds accidents."

Cornelius's mind catalogued the words. The phrasing. The specificity.

*A fall from a high shelf.*

The library. His sanctuary. Alexandros was implying access. Implying the ability to reach Cornelius even in the place he should be safest.

*An unfortunate encounter with a drunk sailor in a dark alley.*

This alley. This moment. A demonstration that Cornelius was vulnerable outside the library's wards.

"I have no intention of abandoning my inquiry," Cornelius said. His claws scraped against stone. "Elias of Tyre was murdered in my library. The Kallistos vault was breached. I will not allow those violations to go unanswered simply because you find my questions inconvenient."

Alexandros's expression shifted. The pleasant mask dropped for just a moment. What remained was cold. Calculating.

Dangerous.

"Then you are a fool," he said quietly.

He moved.

Not a strike. Not violence.

Just a single step forward and a hand that shot out and closed around Cornelius's neck.

The grip was not tight enough to choke. Not painful.

Just *there*. Controlling. Demonstrating exactly how easy it would be to squeeze.

Cornelius went absolutely still.

Every instinct screamed at him to fight. To claw. To bite. To do *something*.

But he was twelve pounds. And Alexandros could crush his windpipe with a casual flex of fingers.

"Drop this," Alexandros said. His face was very close now. Close enough that Cornelius could see the flecks of amber in his dark eyes. "Walk away. Go back to your books and your cataloging and your comfortable little existence. Forget about Elias. Forget about the vault. Forget you ever thought to play investigator."

Cornelius could not speak. Could barely breathe around the pressure on his throat.

But he could smell.

And Alexandros smelled *wrong*.

Not the turpentine and clay dust Cornelius associated with the Doukas workshop.

Something else. Faint but unmistakable.

Ozone.

Sharp and acrid, like the air before a lightning storm.

The same scent that had filled the library vault the morning after the breach.

And beneath it, barely perceptible but present: burnt almond.

Not cyanide. Not poison.

The smell of high-heat alchemical accelerants. Kiln compounds. The specific chemical signature of the reagents used to melt metal at temperatures far beyond what normal fire could achieve.

The exact scent Cornelius had catalogued in his notes from the vault door.

The vault seal had been melted with alchemical fire. Someone had used kiln accelerants—compounds that smelled of burnt almond when burned—combined with a magical catalyst that left the sharp tang of ozone.

And Alexandros Doukas smelled of both.

The realization cut through Cornelius's fear like a blade.

Alexandros had not just hired someone to breach the vault.

He had *been there*. Had wielded the accelerant himself. Had burned through the iron seal with his own hands.

That was why he had worn the heavy leather gloves in the alley days ago. To hide the burns. The stains. The residue that would mark him as someone who worked with dangerous chemicals and high magic.

"I see you understand," Alexandros said softly.

He had noticed Cornelius's nostrils flaring. Had seen the moment of recognition.

"You cannot—" Cornelius's voice was strangled. Weak.

"I can." Alexandros's grip tightened fractionally. Just enough to make breathing difficult. "And I will. If you do not walk away right now, you will join Elias as another unfortunate casualty of the Spring Feast. A small dragon, found dead in an alley. Perhaps crushed by falling debris. Perhaps poisoned by contaminated fish from a market stall. Tragic. But these things happen."

Cornelius's vision was starting to blur at the edges.

He tried to speak. To protest. To do *anything*.

But his body would not respond. He was frozen. Prey in the grip of a predator.

"Servants are replaceable," Alexandros continued. His voice was almost gentle now. "Couriers. Interns. Librarians. The city will mourn you for a week. Then they will appoint a new Curator and life will continue. No one will remember the foreign dragon who thought he could challenge his betters."

The pressure released.

Cornelius staggered backward, gasping. His wings scraped against the stone wall. His claws scrabbled for purchase on the uneven ground.

Alexandros straightened his sleeve. Adjusted his collar. The pleasant mask returned as if it had never left.

"Good evening, Curator Drake," he said. "I trust we will not need to have this conversation again."

He turned and walked away.

Not hurrying. Not looking back.

Just striding calmly out of the alley toward the residential quarter as if he had done nothing more threatening than discuss the weather.

Cornelius stood frozen against the wall.

His throat ached. His scales felt too tight across his chest. His wings trembled with adrenaline and unspent fear.

He had been *so stupid*.

Walking alone through empty streets. Focused on his pride and his theories and his desperate need to prove himself competent. Not thinking about physical safety. Not considering that the person who had killed Elias might view Cornelius as an equal threat.

He had thought being small made him insignificant.

Instead it made him *easy*.

Cornelius's legs shook as he forced himself to move. One step. Then another. Toward the far end of the alley. Away from where Alexandros had disappeared.

He needed to get somewhere safe. Somewhere public. Somewhere with witnesses and light and people who would notice if a small dragon was attacked.

He needed—

He needed *Zeph*.

The thought arrived with brutal clarity.

Zeph, who had been watching his back for days. Who had spotted threats Cornelius missed. Who could move through crowds and talk to people and provide the kind of backup that made a twelve-pound dragon feel less like prey and more like an investigator.

Zeph, whom Cornelius had driven away with his obsessive focus and dismissive arrogance.

Zeph, who was currently at the Feast market, laughing with friends, finally free of Cornelius's relentless demands.

Cornelius reached the end of the alley and stumbled out into a wider street. Oil lamps flickered in wall sconces. A few people walked past, heading toward evening destinations. None of them looked at the small dragon pressed against the corner of a building, trying to catch his breath.

He was alone.

Truly, completely alone.

And Alexandros Doukas—the man who had killed Elias, who had breached the vault, who had stolen the Kallistos correspondence and probably sold it for profit or leverage—had just threatened to kill him.

Not someday. Not eventually.

*Soon*.

If Cornelius did not stop investigating.

If he did not walk away and pretend he had learned nothing.

If he did not abandon his library and his hoard and his responsibility to the sanctuary that had been violated.

Cornelius's claws scraped against stone.

He thought of the vault. The melted seal. The stolen documents. Elias's body crumpled on the floor.

He thought of Alexandros's calm, pleasant voice delivering death threats as casually as weather predictions.

He thought of Zeph's face during their argument. The hurt and anger and frustration.

*You're doing it again. Acting like you're the only one who cares about solving this.*

Cornelius had been wrong about Petros. Wrong about Sophia. Wrong about so many connections and assumptions.

But he was not wrong about this.

Alexandros Doukas had killed Elias of Tyre.

And if Cornelius walked away now, Alexandros would never face consequences.

Would continue moving through the city. Wealthy. Respected. Untouchable.

While Elias's body moldered in whatever unmarked grave the city provided for debtors and criminals.

While the library remained sealed and violated and unsafe.

While Cornelius lived with the knowledge that he had been threatened into silence by someone who treated murder as a minor inconvenience.

His wings stopped trembling.

His breathing steadied.

The fear was still there. Cold and sharp in his chest.

But beneath it, something else was building.

*Anger*.

Cornelius pushed away from the wall and started walking.

Not toward his rented room. Not toward the library.

Toward the market square.

Where the Feast continued. Where Zeph was probably still enjoying music and fried dough and the company of people who did not treat every interaction as part of an obsessive investigation.

Cornelius owed him an apology.

A real one. Not qualified by pride or delayed until after he had made progress.

And then—assuming Zeph was willing to forgive him—they needed to talk.

Because Cornelius now knew exactly who had killed Elias.

And he had the scent evidence to prove it.

But solving a murder was very different from surviving the murderer long enough to present that proof to someone with actual authority.

For that, he needed help.

He needed his apprentice.

He needed his *friend*.

Cornelius's claws clicked steadily against the cobblestones as he walked toward the distant sound of drums and lyres and celebration.

His throat still ached where Alexandros had gripped it.

But his mind was already cataloging. Organizing. Planning the conversation he would have with Zeph. The apology he owed. The evidence he had gathered.

The case he would build.

Not alone.

Not anymore.

# Chapter 14

# Chapter 14

The library steps were empty.

Cornelius stood at the base of the wide stone staircase and stared up at the iron-banded doors. Still sealed. Still barred. The heavy storm-season locks Captain Melas had installed gleamed dully in the lamplight from the street sconces.

His library. His sanctuary. His *hoard*.

Locked against him.

Cornelius's throat ached. The bruises from Alexandros's grip had settled into a persistent, throbbing pain that sharpened every time he swallowed. He had walked the long way back from the market square—through crowded side streets where witnesses could see him, avoiding dark alleys and quiet corners—and his legs trembled with exhaustion.

The market had been nearly empty when he arrived. The Feast musicians packing up their drums. Vendors closing stalls. The crowds already dispersing toward home and bed.

And no sign of Zeph.

Cornelius had searched. Had circled the plaza twice. Had even asked a bored-looking stall keeper if he had seen a tall, gangly boy with bronze-sheened hair.

"Lots of kids here tonight," the man had said, shrugging. "All look the same after a while."

So Cornelius had given up and come here. To the only place that felt remotely safe despite the Watch seals and his forced exile.

He mounted the steps slowly. One at a time. Claws clicking against stone worn smooth by centuries of foot traffic.

Halfway up, he spotted the bundle.

Not a bundle.

A person.

Curled against the library's left pillar where the overhang created a small sheltered alcove. Dark clothes blending into shadow. Knees drawn up. Head pillowed on folded arms.

Zeph.

Cornelius stopped. His wings rustled involuntarily.

The boy was *asleep*. Here. On the cold stone steps. In clothes that were clearly inadequate for spending the night outdoors.

Why?

Cornelius approached carefully. Quietly. His investigator's eye catalogued details automatically: the way Zeph's shoulders rose and fell with deep, even breaths. The smudge of what might be pastry sugar on his collar. The scuffed knees of his trousers from kneeling or sitting somewhere rough.

He looked young. Unbearably young.

Sixteen. Still a child by human standards, even if he pretended otherwise.

And Cornelius had yelled at him. Had dismissed his very reasonable request for rest. Had treated him like an obstacle instead of a partner.

Had driven him away.

And yet here Zeph was. Sleeping outside the sealed library like a faithful hound waiting for its master to return.

Cornelius's chest hurt. Not from the bruises. From something else entirely.

He should wake the boy. Should apologize. Should—

"He has been here since sunset."

Cornelius spun, wings flaring defensively.

A figure stood in the deeper shadows near the library's side entrance. Tall. Slender. Moving forward into the lamplight with the unhurried grace of someone who had all the time in the world.

Imelda Kassiani. Head Librarian.

Cornelius's wings folded immediately. "I did not hear you approach."

"You were focused elsewhere." Imelda's voice was calm. Measured. The kind of voice that could soothe panicked students during exam season or silence rowdy children with a single raised eyebrow. She moved to stand beside Cornelius, looking down at Zeph's sleeping form. "He came here looking for you. When I told him you had not returned, he said he would wait."

"On the steps?"

"I offered him my office couch. He refused." Imelda's silver braids gleamed faintly in the lamplight. Her ink-stained hands were clasped loosely in front of her. "He said he wanted to be where you would see him first. In case you came back worried."

The words landed like small stones in still water.

*In case you came back worried.*

Zeph had been waiting. Not because Cornelius had ordered him to. Not because it was his job.

Because he cared.

Cornelius swallowed. The movement sent a fresh spike of pain through his bruised throat.

Imelda's gaze sharpened. "You are hurt."

"It is nothing."

"Cornelius."

The single word carried the weight of nearly two centuries. Imelda had been Head Librarian when Cornelius first established his hoard in Solterra Bay. Had helped him navigate the city's bureaucratic maze to secure the Curator position. Had taught him which families to court and which to avoid.

She was the only human whose authority he respected without reservation.

"I had an encounter," Cornelius said carefully. His voice came out rougher than intended. "With Alexandros Doukas. He made his position regarding my investigation quite clear."

Imelda's expression did not change. But something shifted in her eyes. A cooling. A hardening.

"I see." She gestured toward the side entrance. "Come. We should talk before you wake the boy."

Cornelius glanced at Zeph. Still sleeping. Still curled against the pillar.

"He will be safe," Imelda said. "The Watch patrol passes every twenty minutes. And I will keep watch from the alcove window."

Cornelius followed her to the side door. She produced a key—her own, distinct from the master Cornelius had surrendered—and unlocked the smaller entrance that led to the staff corridors.

The library's interior was dark. Silent. The familiar vanilla-and-dust scent wrapped around Cornelius like a blanket.

*Home.*

He had not realized how desperately he had missed it until this moment.

Imelda did not light the lamps. She moved through the corridors with the confidence of someone who knew every stone and corner by heart. Cornelius followed, his night vision more than adequate for the dim space.

They stopped in the narrow hall outside the administrative offices. Close enough to the alcove window that Imelda could keep her promise about watching Zeph. Far enough from the sealed vault that Cornelius did not feel the immediate prickle of violation.

"Tell me," Imelda said.

So Cornelius told her. Not everything. Not the full timeline of his investigation or the humiliating failure with Petros. Just the relevant parts.

Eudora hiring Elias to steal the Kallistos glaze formula.

Elias promising delivery and dying before he could complete the job.

Cornelius's theory about industrial espionage and tile-market competition.

And then, more quietly, Alexandros Doukas. The threat in the alley. The grip on his throat. The scent of ozone and burnt almond that marked the man as the vault-breaker and Elias's killer.

Imelda listened without interruption. When Cornelius finished, she was silent for a long moment.

Then she said, "The Kallistos correspondence. You believe it contained the glaze formula?"

"Eudora was quite specific. She paid Elias fifty silver crescents to retrieve it from the family vault."

"Mm." Imelda's fingers drummed once against her forearm. A considering gesture. "And you have operated under the assumption that the vault contained House Kallistos's proprietary trade secrets?"

"Yes. Recipes. Ratios. Manufacturing processes. Anything that would give a competitor an advantage in the luxury tile market."

"I see." Imelda tilted her head slightly. "May I offer an alternative interpretation?"

Cornelius's wings rustled. "Please."

"The Kallistos vault does not contain tile recipes." Imelda's voice was gentle. Patient. The tone she used when correcting a student's fundamental misunderstanding. "It contains letters. Personal correspondence dating back forty years."

The words took a moment to process.

Letters.

Not business documents. Not manufacturing secrets.

*Letters.*

"I do not understand," Cornelius said slowly.

"The old patriarch—Petros's grandfather—kept a mistress. A merchant's daughter from one of the smaller islands. Very beautiful. Very scandalous." Imelda's expression was neutral. Archival. "He wrote to her frequently during the years of their affair. She wrote back. When she died, the letters were purchased by House Kallistos to prevent their circulation. They have been locked in the family vault ever since."

Cornelius stared at her.

His entire theory. The industrial espionage framework. The tile-market competition.

*Wrong.*

"But Eudora said—"

"Eudora was told what Elias wanted her to believe." Imelda's ink-stained hands gestured slightly. "Think, Cornelius. If you were planning to steal valuable correspondence and needed funding, would you tell your patron the truth? Or would you offer them something they desperately wanted?"

The glaze formula.

Eudora had been desperate for it. Willing to pay handsomely. Willing to overlook the legal and ethical problems of commissioning theft.

Elias had used that desperation.

Had lied about what he was actually planning to steal.

"He sold her a fiction," Cornelius said. His mind was racing. Reorganizing. "Made her believe she was funding industrial espionage when in fact—"

"He was stealing blackmail material." Imelda nodded. "Love letters from a powerful family's patriarch. Written proof of an affair that would embarrass House Kallistos even now, decades after the principals' deaths. That kind of leverage is worth far more than a tile recipe."

"But who would pay for such letters?"

"Anyone with a grievance against House Kallistos. Anyone seeking political advantage. Anyone who trades in secrets and reputation." Imelda's gaze was steady. "Mago Hanno, for instance, deals in more than smuggled fireworks. Information is a very liquid currency in the harbor district."

Cornelius's claws scraped against stone.

Not industrial espionage.

*Blackmail.*

Elias had planned to steal the letters. Had recruited someone with technical skill—Alexandros—to breach the vault. Had intended to sell the correspondence to the highest bidder.

And something had gone wrong.

A betrayal. A double-cross. A partnership that collapsed into murder.

"How do you know this?" Cornelius asked. "About the letters?"

"I have been Head Librarian for sixty-three years." Imelda's voice was dry. Amused. "I know what is stored in every vault in this building. It is my job."

Of course she did.

Cornelius felt a familiar prickle of embarrassment. He had been so focused on his own investigation. So caught up in proving his competence after the Petros debacle. That he had not thought to simply *ask* the person who actually managed the vault records.

"I should have consulted you earlier," he said stiffly.

"Yes. You should have." But Imelda's tone was not unkind. "You are a brilliant cataloguer, Cornelius. And you have a dragon's instinct for protecting your hoard. But you are not a detective by training. And you do not always recognize when you need help."

The words stung because they were true.

Cornelius's tail coiled. "Alexandros Doukas killed Elias. I am certain of it. The scent evidence—"

"Will not be sufficient for Captain Melas without corroborating proof." Imelda cut him off gently but firmly. "You know this. Scent is not admissible in a Council trial unless verified by an alchemist. And Alexandros has the resources to dispute any chemical analysis."

"Then what do I do?"

Imelda regarded him for a long moment. Then she smiled. It was a small expression. Warm.

"You do what you have always done best. You document. You organize. You build an airtight case from observable facts." She gestured toward the depths of the library. "And you let your friends help you."

Friends.

The word settled around Cornelius like a cloak.

He glanced toward the alcove window. Through the glass he could just make out the shape of Zeph still curled against the pillar outside.

"I was unkind to him," Cornelius said quietly. "Earlier. At the market. He asked for a break and I dismissed him as frivolous."

"I know. He told me." Imelda's voice was matter-of-fact. "He also told me you have been working yourself into exhaustion trying to solve this case alone. Trying to prove you are competent after the incident with Petros Kallistos."

Cornelius's wings folded tight. "I do not wish to discuss—"

"You were wrong about Petros. You are allowed to be wrong, Cornelius." Imelda's tone gentled. "Being wrong once does not make you incompetent. It makes you fallible. Like the rest of us."

The words should have been humiliating.

Instead they felt oddly... liberating.

Cornelius had spent so much energy these past days trying to prove he was infallible. Trying to force the evidence into neat patterns that demonstrated his brilliance.

What if he simply accepted that he had made mistakes? That he needed help? That solving this case mattered more than protecting his pride?

"Go wake your apprentice," Imelda said. "Apologize properly. Then come inside and work together. I will make tea."

She turned and walked deeper into the library, silver braids swaying.

Cornelius stood alone in the corridor.

Then he moved back toward the side entrance. Out onto the steps.

Zeph was still sleeping. His breathing had gotten slightly irregular. The kind of shift that suggested he was close to waking naturally.

Cornelius approached carefully. Sat down on the stone step beside the boy's curled form.

Up close, he could see the smudge of pastry sugar more clearly. Could see the faint dark circles under Zeph's eyes. The way his hands were tucked under his chin for warmth.

He had waited here. For hours. In the cold.

Because he cared.

Cornelius reached out and gently tapped Zeph's shoulder with one claw.

The boy jerked awake immediately. Eyes flying open. Body tensing.

"Easy," Cornelius said. His rough voice came out softer than intended. "It is only me."

Zeph blinked. Oriented. Focused on Cornelius's face.

Then he scrambled upright, nearly banging his head on the pillar. "Cornelius! Where were you? I went back to the square and you were—" He stopped. His gaze sharpened. "What happened to your throat?"

Cornelius's wing moved instinctively to cover the bruises. "I am fine."

"You're not fine. There are *finger marks*." Zeph leaned closer, expression shifting from sleepy confusion to sharp alarm. "Who grabbed you?"

"Alexandros Doukas." No point in lying. Zeph would extract the truth eventually. "He intercepted me in an alley near the baths. Made it quite clear that continued investigation would result in unfortunate accidents."

Zeph's hands curled into fists. "That—he can't just—you need to tell Captain Melas!"

"And say what? That a respected artisan-merchant spoke to me in a public alley? That I *smelled* chemicals on him?" Cornelius shook his head. "Theo already considers me an obstruction. Without proof, an accusation would only make things worse."

"So he just gets away with it?"

"No. We build a case he cannot dispute." Cornelius met Zeph's eyes. "But I cannot do that alone. And I should not have tried."

Zeph went very still. "What?"

"I was wrong. Earlier. At the market." The words came with difficulty. Cornelius was not practiced at apologies. "You asked for a reasonable accommodation. A brief rest during a festival. And I dismissed you as frivolous because I was too focused on proving my own competence after the Petros incident."

"I mean, yeah. You were kind of a jerk about it." But Zeph's voice had lost its sharp edge. "I figured you were just stressed."

"Stress does not excuse poor behavior. You are not my errand boy. You are my apprentice. My partner in this investigation." Cornelius's tail swished once. "And I owe you an apology. I am sorry."

Zeph stared at him for a long moment.

Then the boy's face split into a tired but genuine grin. "Thanks. That... actually means a lot."

"You were also correct that I have been obsessing. Using the investigation to avoid thinking about my failures." Cornelius forced himself to continue. "I do not like being wrong. It makes me feel incompetent. So I try to prove I am always right, which leads to poor judgment and—" He gestured vaguely. "This."

"Getting choked in an alley?"

"Among other things."

Zeph's grin faded into something more serious. "So what do we do now?"

*We.*

Not *you*. Not Cornelius alone against the world.

*We.*

Cornelius felt something in his chest unclench.

"Now we go inside. Imelda has offered her office and is making tea. And we organize what we know." He stood, offering Zeph his wing in a steadying gesture. "Starting with the fact that I have been operating under a completely incorrect assumption about the stolen correspondence."

Zeph hauled himself to his feet, joints popping. "What do you mean?"

"The Kallistos vault does not contain tile recipes. It contains love letters from the old patriarch to his mistress. Forty years of personal correspondence that would severely embarrass the family if made public."

Zeph's eyes went wide. "Wait. So Elias wasn't stealing business secrets?"

"No. He was stealing blackmail material. And he lied to Eudora about what he was actually after to secure her funding." Cornelius started toward the side entrance. "Which reframes the entire motive structure."

"Because love letters are worth more than tile recipes?"

"In the right hands, yes. Reputation and honor are currencies just as valuable as silver." Cornelius pushed open the door. The library's familiar scent washed over him. "And someone was willing to kill to keep those letters."

Zeph followed him inside. "Alexandros."

"Almost certainly. But we still need to establish how and why Elias's partnership with Alexandros collapsed into murder."

They walked through the dark corridors toward the glow of lamplight spilling from Imelda's office. The Head Librarian had indeed made tea. The scent of mint and honey filled the small space.

Imelda gestured them to the chairs arranged around her desk. "Sit. Drink. Then we work."

Cornelius climbed onto the chair—specially reinforced to hold a small dragon's weight—and accepted the cup Zeph handed him. The warm ceramic felt good against his claws.

He sipped. The mint was not quite as fresh as the bundle Zeph had brought him days ago, but it was still soothing.

Zeph gulped his tea like someone who had spent hours in the cold and desperately needed warmth.

"All right," Cornelius said. Setting his cup down carefully. "Let us organize what we know. Fact-by-fact. No assumptions."

"Elias delivered a package to the Kallistos vault," Zeph offered. "We saw him do it."

"Correct. The package smelled of lapis lazuli powder and machine oil. Residue consistent with lock-picking tools or alchemical reagents."

"The vault was breached the next night," Imelda added. "The iron seal melted by high-heat accelerants."

"And Elias died inside the vault." Zeph's voice was quieter now. "Poisoned."

Cornelius nodded. "I smelled burnt almond near his body. I initially catalogued it as cyanide."

"But?" Zeph prompted.

Cornelius's claws tapped against his teacup. "But when Alexandros grabbed me tonight, he smelled of burnt almond *and* ozone. The exact scent profile from the vault breach."

"So he was there. Physically there." Zeph leaned forward. "That proves—"

"It proves proximity. Not necessarily guilt." Cornelius held up a claw. "We must be precise. The scent tells us Alexandros handled high-heat alchemical compounds recently. The same compounds used to melt the vault seal."

Imelda's fingers drummed once on her desk. "Burnt almond. Not cyanide?"

"I thought it was cyanide initially. But cyanide leaves other markers. Skin discoloration. Specific tissue damage. Sister Photine checked for those signs and ruled them out."

"So what smells like burnt almond but is not cyanide?" Zeph asked.

Cornelius's mind turned the question over. Cataloguing. Cross-referencing against his extensive knowledge of library preservation and—

No.

Not library knowledge.

*Tile-making* knowledge.

He had researched the Doukas family workshop when investigating Sophia. Had read about their kiln processes. Their specialized glazes. Their high-temperature firing techniques.

Tile kilns used accelerants to achieve the extreme heat required for certain finishes.

Those accelerants were alchemically treated compounds. Mixed with metal filings and reagents that—

Cornelius went very still.

"What?" Zeph was watching him. "You just got your 'I figured something out' face."

"Tile kiln accelerant," Cornelius said slowly. "It is an alchemical compound used to boost kiln temperatures beyond what natural fire can achieve. It smells of burnt almond when it burns. And it leaves ozone residue when combined with a magical catalyst."

"So Alexandros used kiln accelerant to melt the vault seal," Imelda said. Not a question. A confirmation.

"Yes. The exact tool of his trade. Something he would have ready access to. Something he would know how to handle safely." Cornelius's claws flexed. "And if Elias inhaled those fumes in a confined space—"

"The vault is small," Zeph said. "No ventilation except that one grate."

"Exactly. Alexandros melts the seal. The accelerant burns. The fumes fill the vault." Cornelius could see it now. The sequence of events clicking into place. "Elias is inside, waiting. He inhales the fumes. They are toxic in concentrated doses."

"So it wasn't murder-murder," Zeph said slowly. "It was like... accidental?"

"Or deliberate negligence." Imelda's voice was cold. "If Alexandros knew the fumes were lethal and chose to use the accelerant anyway."

Cornelius thought of the melted seal. The careful, controlled burn. The precision of the breach.

Alexandros had known exactly what he was doing.

Had known the fumes would fill the vault.

Had either not warned Elias, or had not cared.

"It was not cyanide," Cornelius said quietly. His throat ached. His wings were folded tight. "It was fire."

# Chapter 15

The tea had gone cold.

Cornelius stared at the cup sitting on Imelda's desk. The mint leaves had settled to the bottom, forming a dark sediment against the white ceramic. The surface was still. Undisturbed.

How long had they been sitting here? An hour? Two?

The Head Librarian had excused herself twenty minutes ago. Something about checking the staff entrance locks and ensuring the Watch patrol had not altered their route. Her office felt larger without her presence. Emptier.

Cornelius sat in the reinforced chair, claws resting on the desk's edge. His throat ached. The bruises from Alexandros's grip had settled into a persistent throb that sharpened whenever he swallowed or turned his head.

Across from him, Zeph was sprawled in the second chair. The boy had his long legs stretched out, heels braced against the floor. His arms were crossed. His expression was the particular kind of frustrated that came from staring at a puzzle with missing pieces.

"Okay," Zeph said. Not for the first time. "So we know Alexandros killed Elias. We know *how* he killed him. Kiln accelerant, magical catalyst, toxic fumes in a sealed vault."

"Correct." Cornelius's voice came out rougher than intended. He cleared his throat carefully. The motion sent another spike of pain through the bruised tissue.

"And we know Eudora hired Elias to steal what she *thought* was a glaze formula, but was actually blackmail letters."

"Yes."

"But Elias lied to her about what he was stealing."

"Apparently."

Zeph's fingers drummed against his bicep. "So who was Elias *really* working for? Like, who wanted the letters?"

Cornelius's tail swished once. A slow, thoughtful motion.

He had been asking himself the same question since Imelda's revelation. The glaze formula had been a fiction. A story Elias sold to Eudora to secure funding. But if Elias had been planning to steal blackmail material all along, he must have had a buyer.

Someone willing to pay for forty years of scandalous correspondence.

Someone with a grudge against House Kallistos or an interest in political leverage.

"The letters themselves are valuable," Cornelius said slowly. "Personal correspondence from the old patriarch would damage the family's reputation. Proof of infidelity. Proof of illegitimate children, perhaps. Depending on the content."

"So Elias steals them and sells them to... who? Someone who hates the Kallistos family?"

"Or someone who brokers in secrets." Cornelius thought of Mago Hanno. The orc smuggler who dealt in more than fireworks and restricted cargo. "Information has value in the harbor district. Leverage can be sold or traded."

Zeph nodded. "Okay. So Elias plans the heist. He gets Eudora to fund it by lying about the glaze formula. He gets Petros drunk and tricks him into writing down the vault code. He hires Alexandros to actually crack the wards and melt the seal."

"And then something went wrong."

"Yeah. But what?"

Cornelius's claws tapped against the desk. A rhythmic pattern. Organizing his thoughts.

The sequence of events. Start from the beginning.

Elias delivers the package to the vault. The package contains Eudora's payment—fifty silver crescents hidden in a correspondence folder.

The wards accept the package because it is addressed to the Kallistos vault. Legitimate. Expected.

The next night, someone breaches the vault.

The iron seal is melted with kiln accelerant and magical fire.

Elias is inside the vault when the accelerant burns. He inhales the fumes. Dies.

His body is found the following morning along with the broken seal and missing correspondence.

Cornelius's wings rustled.

"What?" Zeph leaned forward. "You just twitched."

"The timeline," Cornelius said. His mind was moving faster now. Cataloguing. Cross-referencing. "Elias delivered the package on Secondday. The vault was breached that night or early the next morning. His body was discovered at dawn when I opened the library."

"Right. So?"

"So the breach happened quickly. Within hours of the package delivery." Cornelius's tail coiled. "Why the rush? If Elias had been planning this for weeks—recruiting Alexandros, gathering tools, manipulating Petros—why execute the theft immediately after delivering the payment?"

Zeph frowned. "Maybe he was worried someone would notice the package? Like, get suspicious and check the vault early?"

"Possible. But the package was logged as legitimate correspondence. No one had reason to inspect it." Cornelius's claws flexed. "Unless Elias feared his partnership with Alexandros was unstable."

"You think they were already fighting?"

"I think Elias may have realized he had made a dangerous ally." Cornelius remembered the argument Zeph had witnessed in the market square. Sophia Doukas and Elias. The tension. The mention of wards and sequences and withheld payment.

Sophia Doukas. Alexandros Doukas.

House Doukas.

"Sophia hired Elias," Cornelius said. The pieces were aligning. Clicking into place with the satisfying weight of properly shelved books. "She wanted the Kallistos letters to damage their reputation. To level the tile market by destroying their family's honor."

Zeph's eyes widened. "The handkerchief. With Petros's monogram. You said it smelled like lilac and turpentine."

"Petros and the Doukas workshop. Yes." Cornelius's mind raced ahead. Following the thread. "Sophia seduced Petros or simply cultivated a relationship with him. Close enough to acquire his handkerchief. Close enough to learn about the vault and its contents."

"She used him."

"As Elias used him. Petros was a tool. Drunk. Careless. Easy to manipulate." Cornelius felt a pang of guilt. He had accused Petros publicly. Had treated him as a conspirator when in fact the man had simply been prey for more calculating minds.

Zeph was nodding. Fitting the pieces together. "So Sophia hires Elias. Elias brings in Alexandros because he needs someone who can actually crack the wards and melt the seal. They plan the job together."

"But then Elias grows nervous. Or greedy." Cornelius's tail lashed once. "He has Eudora's fifty silver crescents. He has access to valuable blackmail material. Why share the profit with Alexandros and Sophia when he could take everything for himself?"

"He tried to double-cross them."

"Yes."

The word settled in the small office like a stone dropping into still water.

Elias had planned to betray his partners. Had intended to steal the letters and disappear. Sell them to Mago Hanno or another broker. Keep Eudora's payment *and* the proceeds from the blackmail sale.

But Alexandros had discovered the betrayal.

Had followed Elias to the vault.

Had melted the seal as planned.

And then had killed him.

Not with poison. Not with a blade.

With fire. Alchemical fire that filled the small vault with toxic fumes while Elias was trapped inside.

Cornelius's wings pressed tight against his back.

"That is why Alexandros smelled of burnt almond and ozone when he grabbed me," he said quietly. "He had been handling kiln accelerant recently. Either destroying evidence or—"

He stopped.

His claws went still against the desk.

A new thought. Sharp and cold.

"Or?" Zeph prompted.

"Or he has not yet completed his task." Cornelius's voice was barely above a whisper. His mind was moving very fast now. Racing through implications. "Elias is dead. The vault is breached. The correspondence is missing."

"Right. Alexandros took the letters."

"Did he?"

Zeph blinked. "What do you mean? Of course he did. The vault was empty when you checked it."

"The shelf was empty. Yes." Cornelius's tail began to coil. Slow. Deliberate. "But if Alexandros successfully removed the letters from the building, why did he threaten me in the alley? Why risk drawing attention to himself by assaulting a Curator?"

Zeph opened his mouth. Closed it. "Because... you were investigating?"

"I was asking questions, yes. But I had no proof. No admissible evidence. Captain Melas had already closed the case." Cornelius's claws tapped faster now. The rhythm of thoughts aligning. "Alexandros could have simply ignored me. Let the Watch's ruling stand. Let the Spring Feast end and the city return to normal routine."

"But he didn't."

"No. He intercepted me in an empty alley and made explicit threats. He wanted me to stop investigating. Immediately." Cornelius's wings rustled. "Why?"

Zeph leaned forward. His elbows braced on his knees. "Because he's worried you'll figure something out."

"Yes. But what?" Cornelius's mind turned the question over. Examining it from every angle. "I already know he killed Elias. The scent evidence proves his involvement in the vault breach. But scent is not admissible without corroboration. He has no reason to fear my investigation unless—"

The thought hit him like a physical blow.

Unless the crime was not yet complete.

Unless there was still evidence to find.

Unless—

"The letters are still here," Cornelius said.

The words came out flat. Certain. The kind of certainty that came not from assumption but from the slow, methodical elimination of alternatives.

Zeph stared at him. "What?"

"The Kallistos correspondence. The blackmail material. It never left the library." Cornelius stood. His chair scraped against the floor. His wings spread slightly. An unconscious gesture. The beginning of a hunt. "Alexandros could not remove it."

"But—why not? He killed Elias. He melted the seal. He had access to the vault."

"Access, yes. But not *exit*." Cornelius's claws clicked against the floorboards as he paced. Small, tight circles. His mind was racing now. Cataloguing. Organizing. "The library's wards are not just protective barriers against intrusion. They are *inventory controls*."

Zeph's face screwed up in confusion. "What does that mean?"

"Every item stored in the private vaults is logged. Tagged by the ward structure. The magic recognizes each piece of correspondence, each artifact, each ledger as belonging to a specific family." Cornelius's tail lashed. "The wards will allow authorized deposits and withdrawals. But if someone attempts to remove an item without proper authorization—"

"The wards go off," Zeph finished. His voice was quiet. Awed. "Like an alarm."

"Exactly." Cornelius stopped pacing. Turned to face Zeph fully. "Alexandros melted the physical seal. But the *magical* protections remained active. If he tried to leave the building carrying the Kallistos correspondence, the wards would have registered the theft."

"So he couldn't take the letters with him."

"Not without triggering an immediate response from the Watch. Not without announcing to the entire city that the vault had been compromised." Cornelius's claws flexed. "He killed Elias. Took the correspondence from the shelf. And then realized he was trapped."

Zeph stood. His hands were clenched into fists. "So what did he do?"

"The only thing he could do. He hid them." Cornelius's voice was steady now. The fear from the alley had burned away. What remained was focus. Purpose. The particular clarity that came from solving a puzzle. "Somewhere in this building. Somewhere he could retrieve them later, after the wards were lifted or after he arranged a legitimate reason to access the library."

"But the wards aren't lifted. The library is still sealed."

"Yes. Which means Alexandros cannot retrieve his prize. Cannot complete the theft." Cornelius's wings rustled. "And if I continue investigating—if I begin searching the building systematically—I might find the letters before he can claim them."

"That's why he threatened you." Zeph's voice was tight. Angry. "He needs you to back off until he figures out how to get the letters out."

"Correct."

They stood in Imelda's office. The cold tea. The scattered notes. The lamplight casting long shadows across the worn floorboards.

Cornelius felt the hoard-threat instinct prickling between his scales. Not a warning this time. A *call*. The same sensation he felt when a misshelved book disrupted the catalog. When disorder invaded his sanctuary.

Something that belonged to the library's inventory was hidden. Misplaced. Wrong.

And he was going to find it.

"Where would he hide them?" Zeph asked. He was already moving toward the door. Energy humming through his lanky frame. "The vault is sealed by the Watch. The main floor is locked. Where in this whole building could you stash a bunch of old letters without someone finding them?"

Cornelius's mind cycled through the library's layout. Three floors. Dozens of rooms. Thousands of shelves and alcoves and storage spaces.

But Alexandros had been pressed for time. Had needed to hide the correspondence quickly. Before the library opened. Before Cornelius arrived at dawn and discovered Elias's body.

"Somewhere accessible," Cornelius said. His claws tapped against his thigh. A thinking gesture. "Alexandros entered through the ventilation system. The same route the thieves used. So he exited the same way."

"The south archive grate."

"Yes. Which means he moved through the maintenance corridors. The spaces behind the walls." Cornelius's tail coiled. "Spaces that are not regularly patrolled or inventoried."

Zeph's eyes lit up. "Like the vent shafts themselves."

"Possibly. But the vents are narrow. Difficult to access without tools. And Alexandros is not a small man." Cornelius paced again. Faster now. "He would have needed somewhere close to his exit route. Somewhere he could reach quickly and without attracting attention if he returned during the day."

"The archives?"

"Too public. Too well-trafficked." Cornelius's mind raced through possibilities. Eliminating. Narrowing. "The storage annexes. The bindery. The cleaning closets off the main corridors."

"That's still a lot of places to search."

"Yes. But we have an advantage." Cornelius stopped pacing. Looked at Zeph directly. "Alexandros does not know the library the way I do. He would have hidden the letters somewhere that seemed secure to an outsider. But not somewhere truly hidden to someone who knows every shelf and cupboard."

Zeph grinned. It was sharp. Fierce. The expression of someone ready to hunt. "So we search. Start with the maintenance corridors and work outward."

"We search methodically. Room by room. Shelf by shelf." Cornelius moved toward the door. His wings were half-spread now. The posture of a dragon defending his hoard. "And we do not stop until we find what was stolen."

They left Imelda's office. Moved through the dim corridors toward the library's heart.

The building was silent around them. No patrons. No footsteps. Just the faint creak of old wood settling and the distant murmur of the Spring Feast outside.

Cornelius led the way. His claws clicked softly against stone. His senses were sharp. Focused.

Somewhere in this sanctuary—his hoard, his responsibility—forty years of scandalous correspondence lay hidden.

Letters that had cost Elias his life.

Letters that Alexandros Doukas had killed to possess.

Letters that would prove, once and for all, exactly who had breached the vault and why.

Cornelius's throat ached. His wings trembled with barely suppressed energy.

But his mind was clear.

The puzzle was not yet solved. But the final piece was close.

And he was going to find it.

"Where do we start?" Zeph asked. His voice was quiet. Tense.

Cornelius stopped at the junction where the administrative corridor met the main archive hall. To the left, the reading rooms. To the right, the storage annexes and maintenance access.

He closed his eyes. Let his hoard-sense extend. Searching for the particular wrongness that came from misplaced inventory.

There.

Faint. But present.

A prickle along his spine. A pull toward the eastern wing.

"This way," Cornelius said.

He opened his eyes and started walking.

Behind him, Zeph followed without question.

The hunt had begun.

# Chapter 16

# Chapter 16

The Intake Chute dominated the library's eastern wall like a brass monument to civic efficiency.

Cornelius stood before it, neck craned back, studying the mechanism he had walked past thousands of times without truly *seeing* it.

The chute itself was a vertical shaft. Wide enough to accommodate bundled correspondence or small parcels. Lined with polished brass that had dulled to a warm patina over decades of use. At street level—two stories above the main reading floor—there was a reinforced deposit slot where patrons could drop materials for processing after hours.

Gravity did the rest.

Items slid down the angled chute and landed in the collection bin at the bottom. A heavy bronze receptacle with a hinged lid. Designed to hold overnight deposits until the morning shift could sort and catalog them.

The bin sat in the Shadow Zone.

That was what the staff called the triangular pocket of space where the curved eastern wall met the main circulation desk. A place where lamplight never quite reached. Where dust accumulated despite regular sweeping. Where the architecture created a natural blind spot from most vantage points in the dome.

Perfect for hiding stolen correspondence.

Perfect for an ambush.

Cornelius's tail coiled tight. His wings pressed against his back. The hoard-sense prickle that had led him here was stronger now. Sharper. Like standing too close to a misshelved restricted grimoire.

Something that belonged to the Kallistos vault was inside that bronze bin.

He was certain.

"That thing is huge," Zeph said from behind him. The boy's voice was quiet. Tense. "How long has it been there?"

"Since the library's founding. Two hundred and eighteen years." Cornelius's claws clicked against the floor as he circled the bin. Examining. Cataloging. "The original architects designed it as a convenience for merchants who conducted business after library hours. They could deposit contracts or correspondence for vault storage without waiting for morning."

"So it is basically a giant mailbox."

"Functionally, yes." Cornelius stopped circling. Stared at the hinged lid. It was locked. A simple mechanism. Designed to prevent casual theft but easy enough to pick with basic tools. "And it has not been used in decades. The Council installed proper vault-transfer drawers when they modernized the security systems. This chute became obsolete."

"But it still works?"

"The mechanism is sound. The chute remains clear." Cornelius's mind was already moving ahead. Calculating. "Alexandros would have known that. Would have researched the building's layout before attempting the breach."

Zeph crouched beside the bin. Ran his fingers along the bronze surface. "You really think he stuffed a bunch of old letters in here?"

"I think he had very limited options." Cornelius's tail swished. "He melted the vault seal. Killed Elias with accelerant fumes. Took the correspondence from the shelf. Then realized the wards would not allow him to leave the building with stolen property."

"So he panicked."

"Or adapted quickly. Which is worse." Cornelius studied the bin's proportions. Large enough to hold several decades of correspondence easily. "He needed somewhere to cache the letters until he could arrange legitimate access. Somewhere obscure. Somewhere the morning staff would not check."

"The Shadow Zone." Zeph straightened. His expression was grim. "Smart."

"Unfortunately, yes." Cornelius turned away from the bin. Scanned the dome's interior. The reading floor stretched before them. Honey-colored stone. Rows of heavy tables. The circulation desk forming a semicircle at the room's heart.

And above, ringing the dome's perimeter, the Index Shelves.

Cornelius's specialty. His domain. Twenty feet of vertical shelving accessible only by the sliding ladder system that ran on brass rails bolted into the wall.

He had maintained those ladders for fifteen years. Knew every quirk of their movement. Every sticky rail section. Every point where momentum built or stalled.

Index Physics, the junior archivists called it. The particular skill set required to navigate the high shelves safely and efficiently.

Cornelius was about to weaponize that knowledge.

"We cannot simply wait for Alexandros to return and hope Captain Melas arrives in time," he said. His voice was steady. Clinical. The tone he used when explaining complex cataloging procedures to new staff. "Alexandros is larger than me. Stronger. He has already demonstrated willingness to use lethal force."

"So what do we do?" Zeph's hands were curling into fists. Uncurling. A nervous gesture. "We can't fight him."

"*I* cannot fight him. Not in any conventional sense." Cornelius's claws tapped against the floor. Organizing his thoughts. "But I can control the environment. I can use the library's infrastructure to neutralize his advantages."

"You mean like... traps?"

"Tactical disadvantages." Cornelius gestured toward the main aisle. The broad corridor between the reading tables that led from the entrance to the circulation desk. "The floor is polished stone. Excellent for acoustics and durability. But the surface can be made dangerously slippery with the proper application of—"

"Bookbinder's wax," Zeph interrupted. His eyes widened. "You want to grease the floor."

"Not the entire floor. Just the primary approach vector." Cornelius was already moving toward the Preservation Workroom. A small annex off the eastern wall where damaged volumes were repaired and rebound. "If Alexandros enters through the main doors—which is the most direct route to the Intake Chute—he will need to cross that aisle."

The Workroom was dark. Cornelius nudged the door open with his snout and slipped inside. The familiar scents of leather and paste and beeswax wrapped around him.

Home.

He located the wax tin by touch. A broad ceramic container filled with the pale yellow compound used to seal book spines and protect leather covers. It was slippery. Persistent. Exactly what was needed.

Zeph appeared in the doorway. "That is a lot of wax."

"We will need most of it." Cornelius gripped the tin's handle in his teeth. Dragged it out into the dome. The ceramic scraped against stone with a sound that made his scales itch.

They worked quickly. Cornelius directed. Zeph executed.

The boy used a wide brush from the Workroom to spread wax across the aisle in a broad stripe. Not obvious. Not thick enough to be immediately visible in lamplight. But sufficient to turn polished stone into a treacherous skating rink.

Cornelius watched the progress with a mix of satisfaction and horror.

He was deliberately creating disorder. Mess. A *hazard* in his pristine library.

The same library where he had once treated Zeph's pastry crumbs like a biohazard incident.

His claws flexed against the floor.

Priorities had shifted.

"Done," Zeph said. He set the brush down and stepped back. The aisle gleamed faintly. Innocent. Deadly. "What else?"

"The ladders." Cornelius turned his attention upward. To the sliding mechanisms that allowed access to the Index Shelves. "They run on rails. Momentum-based. If properly positioned and released, they can be turned into projectiles."

Zeph followed his gaze. "You want to drop a ladder on him?"

"I want to create multiple hazards that force him into a contained space." Cornelius moved to the nearest ladder. Gripped the frame with his claws and tested the slide. Smooth. Well-maintained. "If he crosses the waxed floor and survives that, the ladders provide secondary obstacles. Confusion. Barriers."

"And then what? We just... hope he trips and knocks himself out?"

"No. Then we lock him inside until the Watch arrives." Cornelius released the ladder. Turned to face Zeph fully. "This is not about defeating Alexandros in combat. It is about *containing* him. Preventing escape. Forcing a confrontation he cannot win through physical strength alone."

Zeph's expression was tight. Worried. "And if it doesn't work?"

"Then we use the emergency whistle to summon Captain Melas and we run." Cornelius's tail coiled. "But I do not intend to run."

They spent the next twenty minutes positioning ladders. Cornelius calculated angles. Weight distribution. The physics of momentum and gravity applied to brass and wood.

Three ladders. Staged at intervals along the Index rails. Each one balanced at a precise point where a single hard shove would send it sliding fast along the rail toward the circulation desk.

Mobile barricades.

Zeph climbed. Adjusted. Tested each ladder's balance under Cornelius's sharp-eyed supervision.

When the boy descended the final time, his hands were shaking slightly.

"This is insane," Zeph said. But he was grinning. The nervous, wild grin of someone committed to a terrible plan. "We are actually setting booby traps in the library."

"We are applying tactical principles to environmental control." Cornelius inspected the nearest ladder. Nodded once. "There is a difference."

"Sure. Totally different." Zeph wiped his palms on his trousers. "So what is my job? Where do I hide?"

Cornelius went very still.

He had been avoiding this part. The part where he had to assign Zeph a role in what could become a lethal confrontation.

The boy was sixteen. Gangly. Brave but untrained.

And Cornelius had already watched one young man die in this library.

"You are not hiding," Cornelius said slowly. Each word carefully weighted. "You are going to the staff entrance. You will wait outside with the emergency whistle. If you hear sounds of struggle or if Alexandros attempts to flee, you signal the Watch."

Zeph stared at him. "You want me to *leave*?"

"I want you safe."

"That is the same thing as leaving." Zeph's hands clenched into fists again. "I am not running away while you—what, fight a murderer alone? Are you serious?"

"I am not fighting. I am containing. There is a—"

"Difference. Yeah. I heard." Zeph's voice was tight. Angry. "But you still need someone inside. Someone to trigger the ladders or call for help if things go wrong."

"Zeph—"

"You said I was your partner. Your apprentice." The boy stepped closer. His expression fierce. Stubborn. "Partners do not abandon each other when things get dangerous."

Cornelius's wings rustled. The argument stuck in his throat.

Because Zeph was right.

They were partners. Not master and servant. Not Curator and disposable assistant.

Alexandros had called Zeph a servant. Had implied servants were replaceable. Expendable.

Cornelius would not repeat that cruelty.

"All right," he said quietly. His tail coiled tight. "But you follow my instructions exactly. No improvisation. No heroics."

"Deal."

"And if I tell you to run, you run."

Zeph's jaw tightened. But he nodded. "Okay."

They moved back to the Shadow Zone. To the bronze Intake bin and the dark pocket of space where lamplight did not reach.

Cornelius oriented himself. Calculating sightlines. Approach vectors. The distance from the main doors to the circulation desk was forty feet. The waxed aisle covered the first twenty. The ladder hazards controlled the next fifteen.

That left five feet of open floor directly in front of the bin.

Close quarters. No room to maneuver.

Perfect.

"You will hide behind the circulation desk," Cornelius said. He gestured with one wing toward the heavy wooden structure. "Stay low. Stay quiet. If Alexandros arrives and moves toward the bin, you wait for my signal."

"What signal?"

"You will know it when you hear it." Cornelius's claws flexed. "When I give the signal, you release the nearest ladder. Send it down the rail as hard as you can."

"And then?"

"Then you use the whistle. Three short blasts. The Watch will recognize that as an emergency summons."

Zeph pulled the small brass whistle from his pocket. The one Imelda had pressed into his hand before leaving to check the patrol routes. "Three blasts. Got it."

They positioned themselves. Zeph crouched behind the desk. Out of sight from the main entrance. Close enough to reach the ladder release but far enough back that he would not be immediately visible.

Cornelius climbed onto the Intake bin itself. The bronze surface was cold under his claws. He settled into a crouch. Wings folded. Tail coiled beneath him.

From this vantage point he could see the entire dome. The main doors. The waxed aisle. The staged ladders. The dark approach to the Shadow Zone.

His hoard.

His sanctuary.

Turned into a battlefield.

The hoard-sense prickle was still there. Stronger than ever. The stolen correspondence was inside the bin directly beneath him. He was certain now. Could almost feel the wrongness through the bronze lid.

Forty years of letters. Blackmail material. The reason Elias of Tyre had died choking on alchemical fumes.

Soon Alexandros would come to claim his prize.

And Cornelius would be waiting.

"How long do you think until he shows up?" Zeph whispered from behind the desk.

"I do not know. He cannot access the building during daylight without drawing attention. But the Spring Feast creates opportunities. Noise. Distraction. Crowds." Cornelius's claws tapped against the bronze. A soft, rhythmic sound. "He will come when the Watch patrol rotation leaves this section unmonitored."

"So we just... wait?"

"We wait."

The library settled into silence around them.

Cornelius's acute hearing picked up the distant sounds of the Feast. Drums. Laughter. The calls of vendors closing their stalls for the night. All of it muffled by thick stone walls.

Inside the dome, there was only the quiet.

The particular quality of stillness that came from a space designed to amplify whispers and footsteps. Where every sound mattered. Where silence was a presence rather than an absence.

Cornelius's breathing slowed. Deepened. His training as a Curator included long hours of motionless observation. Waiting for patrons to leave so he could reshelf. Listening for the particular rustle of someone mishandling a fragile manuscript.

Patience was a skill he had honed over fifteen years.

But this patience felt different.

Sharper. Tense.

He was not waiting to correct a cataloging error.

He was waiting for a killer.

His throat ached. The bruises from Alexandros's grip had faded to a dull, persistent throb. A reminder of exactly how easily the man could hurt him.

Could kill him.

Cornelius's wings pressed tighter against his back.

He had made a choice. Had decided that protecting his hoard—proving Elias's murder, recovering the stolen letters, stopping a criminal from escaping justice—was worth the risk.

But the fear was still there.

Cold. Coiled in his chest like a second tail.

"Cornelius?" Zeph's whisper was barely audible.


"I am scared."

The admission hung in the quiet.

Honest. Vulnerable.

Cornelius's claws went still against the bronze.

"I am also scared," he said. His voice was rough. Quiet. "But we are doing this anyway. Because it is necessary. Because the alternative is allowing Alexandros to retrieve these letters and disappear."

"And because Elias deserves justice."

"Yes. That too."

Another silence. Longer this time.

Then Zeph said, "If we survive this, I am taking a week off. Maybe two. I am going to sleep for three days straight and then eat my weight in honey cakes."

Despite everything, Cornelius felt his maw twitch. Almost a smile.

"That sounds reasonable."

"You should take time off too. Go sit in the sun or something. Read a book that is not a cataloging manual."

"I do not read cataloging manuals for leisure."

"Liar."

"I read them for *professional development*. There is a difference."

Zeph's quiet laugh was warm. Real.

The sound settled something in Cornelius's chest. Eased the cold coil of fear just slightly.

They were in this together.

Not Curator and assistant. Not dragon and servant.

Partners.

The silence returned. But it felt less oppressive now. More like the comfortable quiet of the stacks after closing. Familiar. Safe.

Cornelius's hearing tracked the distant sounds of the city. The Feast winding down. Crowds thinning. The Watch patrol passing somewhere outside the library's eastern wall.

His internal clock—honed by years of routine—estimated the time at just past midnight.

The library had been sealed for three days. The wards were still active. The main doors were still locked and barred.

But Alexandros had entered once before through the ventilation system.

He would use the same route again.

Cornelius's gaze shifted to the southern archive corridor. The maintenance access that led to the vent shaft and the loose grate.

That was where Alexandros would appear.

Cornelius's claws flexed. Ready.

The minutes stretched. Long. Tense.

And then—

A sound.

Faint. Metallic.

The scrape of a ventilation grate being moved.

Cornelius's entire body went rigid. His wings flared slightly. Instinct demanding he make himself larger. More threatening.

He forced them back down. Forced himself to remain still. Small. Hidden in the Shadow Zone's darkness.

Across the dome, Zeph had gone completely motionless behind the circulation desk.

Another sound. Closer now.

Footsteps. Careful. Measured.

Someone moving through the southern archive corridor toward the main reading floor.

Cornelius's heart hammered against his ribs. His claws dug into the bronze bin. Every sense focused on the darkness beyond the lamplight.

A figure emerged from the corridor.

Tall. Broad-shouldered. Moving with the careful confidence of someone who knew exactly where they were going.

Alexandros Doukas.

He wore dark clothes. Practical. The heavy leather gloves Cornelius had noted before were absent. His hands were bare. Stained faintly with what might be soot or chemical residue.

He paused at the edge of the main floor. Scanning. Checking for threats.

Cornelius held perfectly still. His bronze scales blended with the bronze bin. His small size an advantage now. Invisible in shadow.

Alexandros's gaze swept the dome. Lingered on the circulation desk. The reading tables. The staged ladders that looked—from his vantage point—like they had simply been left in their working positions.

He saw nothing unusual.

Satisfied, he started forward. Directly toward the Shadow Zone.

Toward the Intake bin.

Toward Cornelius.

His first step onto the waxed aisle was confident.

His second step was a mistake.

Alexandros's boot hit the treated stone and slid. Not far. Not enough to drop him. But enough to break his stride. Make him stumble.

He caught himself. Steadied.

Looked down at the floor with narrowed eyes.

Then he looked up. Scanning again. More carefully this time.

His gaze found the nearest ladder. The angle of its position on the rail.

Found the second ladder. The third.

His expression shifted.

Realization. Calculation.

He knew.

He knew it was a trap.

Alexandros stopped moving. Stood perfectly still in the center of the waxed aisle.

Then he smiled.

Cold. Amused.

"Curator Drake," he called out. His voice echoed through the dome. Calm. Conversational. "I know you are here. I can smell the beeswax. Very creative use of preservation materials."

Cornelius did not respond. Did not move.

"This is unnecessary." Alexandros's hands spread slightly. A placating gesture. "I simply need to retrieve something I left here. Then I will go. No one needs to get hurt."

Still Cornelius waited.

"I assume you have deduced where I hid the correspondence. Clever." Alexandros took a single careful step forward. Testing the wax. "But you must realize you cannot stop me from taking it. You are a very small dragon, Curator. And I have already killed one person this week."

The words hung in the air.

Casual. Matter-of-fact.

A confession delivered like a weather report.

Cornelius's claws dug harder into the bronze.

"So here is what will happen." Alexandros took another step. Slow. Controlled. "You will let me open that bin. I will take what belongs to me. And then I will leave through the same route I entered. If you attempt to interfere, I will break your neck. Do we have an understanding?"

Cornelius's tail coiled tighter.

His mind was racing. Cataloging options. Alexandros was too far from the ladder triggers. Too stable despite the wax. Too confident.

This was not going according to plan.

Alexandros took a third step.

Closer to the circulation desk.

Closer to where Zeph was hiding.

Cornelius made a decision.

He stood. Rose to his full height atop the bronze bin.

Lamplight caught his scales. Turned bronze to amber.

"No," Cornelius said. His voice was steady. Clear. "We do not have an understanding."

Alexandros stopped. Stared at him.

Then laughed.

"You cannot be serious."

"I am always serious about library security." Cornelius's wings spread slightly. Not a threat display. A signal. "You murdered Elias of Tyre. You stole property from the Kallistos vault. You assaulted a Curator. And you are trespassing in a sealed civic building."

"And what exactly do you think you can do about it?"

"I can ensure you do not leave with what you came for." Cornelius's claws flexed. "The Watch will be here shortly. You have perhaps three minutes before Captain Melas arrives with a full patrol."

"You are bluffing."

"Am I?"

Alexandros's expression hardened. The amusement vanished.

He moved.

Fast.

Crossed the remaining waxed floor in three long strides. Boots skidding but staying upright through sheer momentum and balance.

Headed directly for the Intake bin.

Directly for Cornelius.

"NOW!" Cornelius shouted.

Behind the circulation desk, Zeph moved.

The boy hit the first ladder release with both hands.

The ladder shot down the rail. Brass wheels screaming. Twenty feet of wood and metal accelerating like a battering ram.

It caught Alexandros in the shoulder.

The impact spun him. Knocked him sideways into a reading table.

He went down hard.

But he did not stay down.

Alexandros rolled. Came up already moving. His face was twisted now. Furious.

He lunged toward the bin.

Toward Cornelius.

Three feet away.

Two.

Zeph released the second ladder.

It came from the opposite angle. Faster. Heavier.

This one hit Alexandros square in the back.

He dropped. Slammed face-first into the stone floor.

For a moment everything was still.

Then Alexandros pushed himself up. Slow. Shaking.

Blood ran from his nose. His lip was split.

But he was still conscious. Still moving.

His gaze locked onto Cornelius.

"You little—"

The whistle cut him off.

Three sharp blasts. Piercing. Echoing through the dome like a scream.

Alexandros's head snapped toward the circulation desk. Toward where Zeph stood. Visible now. Holding the brass whistle.

"The Watch is coming," Zeph said. His voice shook but held steady. "You should run."

Alexandros looked between Zeph and Cornelius. Calculating. Measuring distances.

Then he ran.

Not toward the Intake bin.

Toward the southern archive corridor. Back the way he had come.

His boots slipped on the waxed floor. He caught himself. Kept moving.

Disappeared into darkness.

Gone.

Cornelius stood atop the bronze bin. Wings spread. Heart hammering.

They had done it.

Alexandros had fled without the letters.

The correspondence was still here. Still recoverable.

Still *evidence*.

"Are you okay?" Zeph was moving toward him now. Climbing over the circulation desk.

"I am fine." Cornelius's voice came out steadier than he felt. "You?"

"Terrified. But fine."

Outside, voices were rising. Shouts. The distinctive clatter of Watch armor.

Captain Melas and his patrol. Responding to the whistle summons.

Cornelius looked down at the bronze bin. At the locked lid beneath his claws.

Inside that container was proof. Justice. The truth that would solve Elias's murder and expose Alexandros Doukas for exactly what he was.

"We need to open this," Cornelius said. "Before the Watch arrives. Before anyone can claim the letters were never here."

Zeph produced a thin piece of wire from his pocket. Lock picks. The boy always carried them.

"On it," he said.

The lock was simple. Designed more for deterrence than true security.

Zeph had it open in less than a minute.

Cornelius jumped down from the bin. Landed beside Zeph as the boy lifted the hinged lid.

Inside, bundled in oilcloth and tied with ribbon gone brittle with age, was a thick stack of correspondence.

Forty years of letters.

The Kallistos patriarch's secret.

Elias's target.

Alexandros's prize.

"We found them," Zeph whispered.

"Yes," said Cornelius.

The front doors shuddered. Someone was working the locks from outside.

Cornelius looked at Zeph. The boy looked back.

"Don't miss," Cornelius had told him before they hid in the shadows.

But Zeph had not missed.

Had hit Alexandros twice with the ladders. Had signaled the Watch exactly when needed.

Had stayed. Had helped.

Had *succeeded*.

The doors swung open.

Captain Theo Melas entered with four guards. Weapons drawn. Expressions grim.

His gaze found Cornelius immediately. Then Zeph. Then the open bin and its contents.

"What," Theo said slowly, "is happening in my city's library?"

Cornelius stepped forward. Wings folded. Tail composed.

"Captain," he said. "I have evidence. And we need to talk."

---

# Chapter 17

# Chapter 17

The silence pressed down like a physical weight.

Cornelius perched atop the bronze Intake bin, wings folded tight against his sides, tail coiled beneath him. The Shadow Zone lived up to its name. Lamplight from the distant dome entrance reached this far corner only as a faint suggestion. Enough to outline shapes. Not enough to reveal details.

Perfect for an ambush.

His claws gripped the cold metal. The hoard-sense prickle was constant now. Insistent. The stolen correspondence was directly beneath him, hidden inside the locked bin. So close he could almost taste the wrongness of it. Decades of letters that belonged in the Kallistos vault, not stuffed into an obsolete collection mechanism.

His throat ached. The bruises from Alexandros's grip had settled into a persistent, tender throb. A reminder of exactly how easily the man could hurt him.

Could *kill* him.

Cornelius's wings trembled slightly. He forced them still.

Across the reading floor, hidden behind the heavy wooden circulation desk, Zeph waited. Cornelius could not see the boy from this angle. But he knew Zeph was there. Crouched low. One hand on the nearest ladder release. The other clutching the emergency whistle.

Ready.

They had been waiting for—Cornelius's internal clock estimated—forty-three minutes.

Forty-three minutes of silence broken only by distant sounds. The fading revelry of the Spring Feast. The occasional call of the Watch patrol passing outside. The settling creaks of old wood and stone.

Forty-three minutes to think about everything that could go wrong.

Cornelius's claws flexed against the bronze.

The trap was set. The floor waxed. The ladders staged. The plan rehearsed.

But plans relied on predictability. On opponents following expected patterns.

Alexandros Doukas had already proven himself adaptable. Dangerous. Willing to kill to protect his interests.

What if he brought weapons this time? What if he entered through a different route? What if—

A faint scraping sound.

Cornelius went utterly still. His acute hearing focused.

There.

From behind the circulation desk. Not from the southern archive corridor where Alexandros had entered before.

From Zeph's hiding spot.

Cornelius's tail twitched. Concern spiked through him.

Then a whisper. Barely audible. Carefully pitched to reach Cornelius without carrying across the dome.

"Cornelius?"

Zeph's voice. Strained. Nervous.

Cornelius hesitated. Breaking silence was a risk. But the boy would not speak without reason.

"What?" Cornelius whispered back. His voice was rougher than intended. Throat still sore.

A pause. Then, quieter still:

"How much longer do you think?"

Cornelius's claws tapped once against the bronze. A thinking gesture that produced no meaningful sound.

"I do not know," he admitted. "Alexandros must wait for the Watch patrol to clear this section. The rotation schedule suggests another—" He stopped. Calculated. "—seventeen minutes before the eastern perimeter is unmonitored."

"Seventeen minutes." Zeph's whisper carried a note of something that might have been amusement or despair. Hard to tell. "Okay. I can do seventeen minutes."

Another pause.

Then:

"I am really bad at waiting."

Despite everything—the fear, the tension, the very real possibility of imminent violence—Cornelius felt his maw twitch.

Almost a smile.

"I have noticed," he whispered.

Silence returned. But it felt different now. Less oppressive. The acknowledgment of shared discomfort had eased something.

Cornelius shifted his weight slightly. The bronze beneath him was cold enough that it had started to leech warmth even through his scales. He ignored the discomfort. Focused instead on listening.

The library's acoustics were excellent. A necessary feature for a space designed around silence and study. Sound carried. Echoed. Every whisper, every footstep, every scrape of chair against stone reverberated through the dome with crystalline clarity.

Which meant Alexandros would be audible long before he became visible.

Assuming he entered through the ventilation system again.

Assuming he came alone.

Assuming—

Cornelius cut off that line of thinking. Assumptions had led him astray before. Had resulted in publicly accusing an innocent man. Had nearly derailed the entire investigation.

He would observe. Document. React to what *was*, not what he feared might be.

Another whisper from the circulation desk.

"Cornelius?"

"Yes?"

"Can I ask you something?"

Cornelius's tail coiled tighter. This felt less like a tactical question and more like the kind of conversation Zeph initiated when he was trying to distract himself.

But they had time. Seventeen minutes, give or take.

"You may ask."

"Why did you become a Curator?"

The question caught Cornelius off guard. His claws went still against the bronze.

"I am a library dragon," he said slowly. "It is... what I am. What I was born to be."

"But you chose *this* library. Right? You could have gone anywhere. Could have started a new collection somewhere else." A pause. "Why Solterra Bay?"

Cornelius considered this.

The truth was complicated. Layered. Involved memories of a younger self who had been drawn to the ancient stone building the way dragons of other species were drawn to gold or jewels.

"The library needed a Curator," he said finally. "And I needed a hoard."

"That is not really an answer."

"It is the only answer I have."

More silence.

Then Zeph said, very quietly:

"I am glad you picked here. I mean. If you had not. I would not have..." The boy trailed off. Started again. "This has been terrifying. And I am pretty sure I am going to have nightmares about waxed floors for the rest of my life. But I am also glad I got to help. To be part of... this."

Something warm and unexpected unfurled in Cornelius's chest.

He had spent fifteen years maintaining careful distance from the humans who used his library. Had referred to them by title and function rather than name. Had treated Zeph himself as an inconvenient but necessary assistant.

But the boy waiting in the dark behind the circulation desk was not an assistant.

He was a partner.

A friend.

Someone who had climbed into a sealed building to help set a trap for a murderer despite being terrified. Who had stayed when offered an easy exit. Who had asked to be trusted as an equal.

Cornelius's wings rustled.

"You break the pattern," he whispered.

"What?"

"Most people I have known treat this library as a resource. A tool. They value it for what it provides but have no investment in its integrity." Cornelius's claws flexed. "You are different. You care about the library itself. About maintaining its sanctity."

"I mean. Yeah. Of course I do. It is—" Zeph's whisper caught slightly. "It is important. What we protect here. What we preserve."

"Yes."

"And you are important too. Like. Not just the library. You." The words came faster now. Tumbling out as if Zeph had been holding them back and the darkness finally gave him the courage to speak. "You are the most annoying person I have ever met. You criticize my handwriting and you gave me a lecture about pastry crumbs that lasted twenty minutes. But you are also the smartest person I know. And when Alexandros grabbed you in that alley I was so angry I could not think straight."

Cornelius went very still.

"You were angry?"

"Of course I was angry. He hurt you. He *threatened* you. And I just—" Zeph's whisper turned fierce. "No one gets to do that. Not to you. Not in our library."

*Our library.*

The phrase settled into Cornelius's chest beside the warmth that had already taken root there.

He had spent so long thinking of the library as *his*. His hoard. His sanctuary. His responsibility alone.

But it was not alone anymore.

Had not been for a while, if he was honest.

"Thank you," Cornelius whispered. His voice came out rougher than intended. "For staying. For helping. For being—" He paused. Searched for the right word. "—loyal."

"You are welcome."

The silence that followed was comfortable. Shared.

Cornelius turned his attention back to listening. The Watch patrol had passed the eastern wall seven minutes ago. Which meant another ten minutes before—

A sound.

New. Different.

Not footsteps or voices.

A faint hissing. Like water on hot metal.

Cornelius's entire body went rigid. His wings flared slightly. Instinct demanding he make himself larger.

The smell hit him half a second later.

Burnt almond. Ozone.

The exact chemical signature he had documented at the melted vault seal.

The exact signature he had smelled on Alexandros Doukas's hands in the alley.

Kiln accelerant. Magical catalyst.

Someone was using alchemical fire to melt a lock.

Cornelius's mind raced. The main doors were still barred from the outside. The ventilation grate in the southern archive was the route Alexandros had used before.

But the service entrance—the staff door that opened onto the narrow alley behind the eastern wall—had a lock.

A lock that could be melted.

The hissing continued. Faint. Distant. Coming from beyond the archives.

Then it stopped.

Silence returned.

But it was a different kind of silence now. Tense. Waiting.

Cornelius's claws dug into the bronze bin.

Alexandros was inside the building.

A faint scrape. Boot leather on stone. Careful. Controlled.

Getting closer.

Cornelius did not move. Did not breathe.

His vision had adjusted to the darkness. He could make out shapes now. The circulation desk. The reading tables. The waxed aisle that looked perfectly normal in shadow.

A figure emerged from the southern archive corridor.

Tall. Moving with deliberate caution.

Alexandros.

He paused at the edge of the main floor. Scanning. His head turned slowly. Taking in the empty dome. The staged ladders that looked—from his vantage point—like they had simply been left in their working positions during normal operations.

Cornelius held perfectly still. His bronze scales blended with the bronze bin. His small size an advantage. Invisible in the Shadow Zone's darkness.

Alexandros took a step forward.

His boot hit the waxed stone.

For a moment nothing happened.

Then his weight shifted and the boot slid.

Just slightly. Just enough to break his stride.

He caught himself. Steadied.

Looked down.

Cornelius's heart hammered against his ribs.

Alexandros crouched. Touched the floor with bare fingers. Rubbed them together.

Stood.

His expression—what little Cornelius could see from this distance in the darkness—shifted.

Calculation. Realization.

He knew.

Alexandros straightened. Did not call out. Did not acknowledge the trap openly.

Instead he moved forward with even more caution. Each step placed carefully. Testing the stone before committing his weight.

Crossing the waxed aisle slowly. Deliberately.

Avoiding the obvious hazard.

Cornelius's wings trembled.

The man was too careful. Too controlled.

This was not going according to plan.

Alexandros reached the far side of the waxed section. His boots found dry stone. He paused again. Scanned the dome.

His gaze swept across the circulation desk.

Across the Shadow Zone.

Across the exact spot where Cornelius perched atop the locked Intake bin.

Cornelius did not move. Did not even blink.

Alexandros's eyes slid past him. Seeing the bin. Seeing the bronze fixture.

Not seeing the small dragon whose scales matched the metal too perfectly.

Satisfied, Alexandros approached.

Head on. No hesitation now.

Directly toward the Intake bin.

Directly toward Cornelius.

Ten feet away.

Eight.

Six.

Cornelius could see details now. The dark clothes. The bare hands—no gloves tonight. The faint chemical stains on Alexandros's fingers.

Four feet.

Alexandros reached the bin. Stopped directly in front of it.

Directly below where Cornelius crouched frozen atop the bronze lid.

Alexandros pulled something from his coat pocket. A thin metal tool. Lockpicks.

He crouched. Fitted the pick into the bin's simple lock.

Worked it with practiced efficiency.

The lock clicked.

Released.

Alexandros pocketed the picks. Gripped the bin's hinged lid.

Lifted.

The lid swung up on old hinges. A faint creak.

Alexandros leaned forward. Peered inside.

Reached in.

His hand emerged holding a bundle. Oilcloth wrapped around something rectangular. Tied with ribbon gone brittle with age.

Forty years of Kallistos correspondence.

Proof of the vault theft.

Evidence of motive for murder.

Alexandros held the bundle. Examined it. Confirmed its contents.

Then straightened. Tucked the oilcloth package under one arm.

Turned toward the southern archive corridor.

Toward escape.

Cornelius moved.

Not toward Alexandros. He could not fight the man directly. Could not stop him through physical force.

But he could stop him from leaving with the evidence.

Cornelius launched himself upward. Wings spread. Claws extended.

Not at Alexandros.

At the air.

His wings caught. Lifted him.

Three feet. Five. Eight.

High enough.

"NOW!" Cornelius shouted. His voice echoed through the dome. Shattered the silence like breaking glass.

Behind the circulation desk, Zeph moved.

# Chapter 18

# Chapter 18

Behind the circulation desk, Zeph moved.

The boy's hand shot to the ladder release. Found the knot Cornelius had tied. The simple slip-knot designed to come apart with one hard pull.

Zeph yanked.

The rope went slack.

The ladder—twenty feet of brass and wood staged at a precise angle on the Index rail—swung down like a pendulum.

Fast.

The momentum built as it arced across the dome. The brass wheels screamed against the rail. The sound was enormous. Deafening in the library's perfect acoustics.

Alexandros spun toward the noise.

The ladder slammed across the opening to the southern archive corridor.

A barricade. Blocking his escape route.

Cornelius dropped.

His wings snapped open. Caught air. Controlled his descent from the high rafters where he had launched himself.

He landed on a reading table. Claws scraping against polished wood. Wings spread wide. Every scale standing on end.

Between Alexandros and the main doors.

Between the murderer and freedom.

Alexandros's gaze locked onto him.

The man's expression was cold. Flat. The genial mask he wore in public had vanished entirely.

"Curator," Alexandros said. His voice was calm. Conversational. As if they were discussing book loans instead of standing in a darkened library after he had just stolen evidence from a crime scene. "That was clever. But ultimately pointless."

He still held the oilcloth bundle under one arm. Forty years of Kallistos correspondence. Proof of motive. Proof of theft.

Not his anymore.

"The letters stay here," Cornelius said. His voice was steady. Clear. The tone he used when enforcing library rules. "You will surrender them and wait for the Watch."

Alexandros smiled.

It did not reach his eyes.

"No," he said.

He moved.

Not toward the barricaded corridor. Not toward the main doors where Cornelius blocked his path.

Toward the waxed aisle.

Directly at Cornelius.

Alexandros's first step hit the treated stone. His boot slid. He had crossed this section before with careful, measured steps.

This time he was running.

His weight shifted wrong. The slick surface pulled his feet out from under him.

He went down hard.

Slammed shoulder-first into the floor. The oilcloth bundle skidded from his grip. Slid across the waxed stone.

Stopped three feet from Cornelius's table.

Cornelius's wings flared.

He could reach it. Could grab the letters. Could—

Alexandros was already moving. Rolling. Coming up in a crouch with feral grace.

Blood ran from his nose where it had struck the floor. His eyes were bright. Furious.

He did not lunge for the bundle.

Instead his hand went to his coat pocket. Pulled out a small glass vial.

The liquid inside caught the lamplight. Amber. Thick.

The scent hit Cornelius half a second later.

Burnt almond. Ozone.

Kiln accelerant. The same compound that had melted the vault seal. The same signature that clung to Alexandros's hands.

But this was different. Concentrated. Mixed with something else. Something that made Cornelius's scales prickle with instinctive dread.

Liquid fire.

The alchemical weapon banned by Council decree after the warehouse fires twenty years ago. Volatile. Uncontrollable once ignited.

Capable of turning stone to slag.

Capable of burning through an entire library in minutes.

"I tried to be reasonable," Alexandros said. He held the vial up. Let Cornelius see it clearly. "But if I cannot leave with the letters, then no one gets them."

His gaze swept the dome. The rows of shelves. The thousands of books and scrolls and manuscripts.

Cornelius's hoard.

"One vial. That is all it takes. Throw it at the stacks. Watch your precious collection burn." Alexandros's smile was terrible. Empty. "You get maybe thirty seconds to choose. Save the books or stop me."

The world narrowed.

Cornelius's entire body went rigid. Wings locked. Tail coiled so tight it ached.

The hoard-prickle flared between his scales. Sharp. Overwhelming. Every instinct screaming at him that his sanctuary was under threat.

Not just the letters.

Everything.

Two centuries of history. Knowledge. Stories. The careful accumulation of civilization preserved in ink and paper.

All of it about to burn.

Unless he stopped it.

Unless he chose.

Alexandros was already drawing his arm back. Preparing to throw.

Cornelius moved.

Not toward Alexandros.

Toward the trajectory.

His mind calculated angles with the same precision he used to catalogue damaged manuscripts. The vial would arc toward the eastern stacks. The section housing the oldest, most fragile volumes. Irreplaceable.

Three seconds to impact.

Two.

Cornelius launched himself from the table. Wings spread. Claws extended.

Flying directly into the path of liquid fire.

The vial left Alexandros's hand.

Spun through the air.

Amber glass catching lamplight.

Cornelius hit it mid-flight.

His claws closed around the vial. Absorbed the momentum. His wings beat frantically. Compensating for the sudden weight.

He had it.

Had caught it.

The glass was warm against his scales. The liquid inside sloshed. Volatile. Unstable.

One crack. One drop. One spark.

And the library would burn anyway.

Cornelius twisted in the air. Dove toward the floor. Away from the shelves. Away from anything flammable.

He landed hard. Rolled. Came up still clutching the vial in both claws.

Safe.

The books were safe.

And he was within arm's reach of Alexandros Doukas.

Exactly where he had sworn never to be.

The man was already moving. Closing the distance. His expression had shifted from cold amusement to something darker.

Rage.

"You should have let it burn," Alexandros said.

He lunged.

Cornelius dropped the vial. Let it roll away across the waxed floor toward the circulation desk. Toward Zeph. Toward safety.

He did not have time to check if it reached the boy.

Alexandros's hand was coming for his throat.

The same grip that had choked him in the alley. The same casual violence that had killed Elias of Tyre.

Cornelius's tail lashed out.

Low. Fast. The way he cleared fallen books from shelves when his claws were full.

It caught Alexandros across the shins.

The sweep was precise. Timed to the man's forward momentum.

Alexandros's legs went out from under him.

He dropped.

Cornelius was smaller. Lighter. Lower to the ground.

He moved while Alexandros was falling.

Spun. Used the momentum of his tail-sweep to position himself.

Landed on Alexandros's back the moment the man hit the floor.

Claws dug into fabric. Into flesh. Holding on with every ounce of strength his small body possessed.

His wings spread wide. Blocking vision. Creating confusion.

His hind claws found purchase just above Alexandros's kidneys. Pressure points. The same spots he used when climbing unstable shelving.

Applied with intent.

Alexandros roared. Tried to roll. To throw him off.

Cornelius's tail wrapped around the man's neck. Not choking. Not yet. But ready.

Control.

He had control.

"Do. Not. Move." Cornelius's voice was rough. Shaking. But clear. "Or I will crush your windpipe."

It was a bluff. Mostly. His tail was strong enough to catalogue heavy folios. To carry small crates. Whether it could actually—

Alexandros went still.

Not because of the threat.

Because he was calculating.

Cornelius could feel it. The tension in the man's muscles. The way his breathing had gone shallow and controlled.

Planning.

"Zeph!" Cornelius called out. Did not take his eyes off the man beneath him. "The whistle! Now!"

Behind the circulation desk, Zeph moved.

Three sharp blasts cut through the dome.

Piercing. Echoing.

The emergency summons.

The sound barely faded before Alexandros moved again.

Fast. Violent.

He bucked. Twisted with strength that should not have been possible from someone pinned face-down.

Cornelius's claws scrabbled for purchase. His tail tightened reflexively.

Not enough.

Alexandros threw him.

Cornelius hit the floor. Slid across the waxed section. His wings crumpled beneath him. Pain flared hot through his left shoulder.

He rolled. Came up. Oriented himself.

Alexandros was on his feet. Blood streamed from new scratches across his neck and back. His coat was shredded. His breathing ragged.

But he was standing.

And the oilcloth bundle—the stolen letters—was still on the floor behind him.

Alexandros did not go for the letters.

He went for Cornelius.

No more calculations. No more cold assessment.

Just rage.

The man crossed the remaining distance in two strides. Grabbed for Cornelius's neck.

Cornelius twisted. Smaller. Faster.

The hand missed.

Caught his wing instead.

Agony shot through Cornelius's shoulder. The delicate membrane tore. He felt it rip. Felt the wrongness of broken structure.

His vision greyed.

No.

Not now.

Not when he was this close.

Cornelius bit.

His fangs were small. Designed for nibbling pen tips and testing paper quality. Not combat.

But they were sharp.

He sank them into the meat of Alexandros's thumb. Tasted blood. Copper and salt.

Alexandros jerked back with a shout.

Released the wing.

Cornelius dropped to the floor. His injured wing would not fold properly. Pain radiated with every heartbeat.

He did not care.

He was still between Alexandros and the letters.

Still standing.

"You cannot win this," Alexandros said. His voice was thick. Strained. "You are a library dragon. You catalog books. This is not your domain."

"You are wrong." Cornelius's voice came out steadier than he felt. "This is exactly my domain. My library. My hoard. And you do not belong here."

Alexandros's expression shifted.

Understanding. Belated. Too late.

He had underestimated the dragon.

Had thought small size meant weakness. Had thought a love of books meant softness.

Had forgotten that dragons—even small ones—were still dragons.

And a dragon defending its hoard was the most dangerous creature in any domain.

Cornelius's wings spread. The injured one hung wrong but he ignored it.

Made himself larger. More threatening.

His claws scored the floor. Stone dust rose.

"The Watch is coming," he said. "You have perhaps two minutes before they breach the main doors. You cannot reach the letters, cross this floor, and escape the building."

"I could kill you in thirty seconds."

"Perhaps." Cornelius's tail coiled. Ready. "But the letters would still be here. And you would still be trapped."

Alexandros's gaze flicked to the barricaded corridor. The main doors. The windows too high and narrow for a human to exit.

Trapped.

His hands curled into fists.

Then he smiled again.

That terrible, empty smile.

"You are right," he said. "I cannot leave with the letters."

He moved.

Not toward Cornelius.

Toward the vial of liquid fire that had rolled across the floor.

That now sat in the shadow of the circulation desk.

Where Zeph was hiding.

Cornelius's heart stopped.

"NO!"

He lunged. Wings flaring. Ignoring the pain.

Too slow.

Too far.

Alexandros reached the vial. Scooped it up. Raised it high.

Aimed at Zeph.

And hesitated.

Because Zeph was not hiding anymore.

The boy stood. Fully visible. One hand gripping the edge of the circulation desk.

The other hand holding Cornelius's incident ledger.

The private documentation of the entire investigation. Dates. Observations. Conclusions.

Proof.

"You throw that," Zeph said. His voice shook but held steady. "And I throw this into the fire with it. All the evidence burns. No one ever proves what you did."

Alexandros froze.

"But if you drop the vial and surrender," Zeph continued. "Maybe Captain Melas goes easy on you. Maybe."

It was a bluff. The Watch did not negotiate with murderers.

But it was a calculated bluff. The kind Cornelius himself might have attempted.

Alexandros's hand trembled. The vial caught lamplight.

"That ledger is worthless," he said. "A dragon's paranoid scribblings. No court would accept it."

"Then you have nothing to lose by letting us keep it." Zeph's grip tightened. "Unless you are worried it actually does prove you killed Elias."

The silence stretched.

Taut. Fragile.

Cornelius stayed frozen. Halfway between Alexandros and Zeph. Wings spread. Every muscle locked.

Waiting.

Then—

Footsteps.

Heavy. Multiple.

Outside the main doors.

Metal clanking. Voices shouting orders.

The Watch.

Alexandros's gaze snapped to the doors. Back to Zeph. To Cornelius.

Calculating one final time.

Then his shoulders dropped.

Defeat.

He set the vial down. Carefully. On the floor.

Straightened.

Raised his empty hands.

"I surrender," he said. His voice was flat. Empty. "To the Watch. Not to a dragon and a boy playing detective."

The main doors shuddered.

Once.

Twice.

On the third impact the bar splintered.

The doors burst open.

Captain Theo Melas entered first. Sword drawn. Four guards behind him. All armed. All ready for violence.

They stopped.

Took in the scene.

The waxed floor. The damaged ladder barricade. The scattered papers and overturned tables.

Cornelius perched on a reading table. Wings spread. Blood on his claws. One wing clearly injured.

Zeph behind the circulation desk. White-knuckled grip on Cornelius's ledger.

Alexandros in the center. Hands raised. Blood streaming from scratches on his neck and face.

And on the floor between them, the oilcloth bundle.

Forty years of Kallistos correspondence.

Theo's gaze swept the room once more. Cataloging. Processing.

Then locked onto Alexandros.

"Alexandros Doukas," he said. His voice carried the weight of official authority. "You are under arrest for the murder of Elias of Tyre. The theft of property from the Kallistos family vault. Assault on a Curator. And attempted arson against a civic building."

He gestured. Two guards moved forward. Grabbed Alexandros's arms. Locked manacles around his wrists with sharp metallic clicks.

Alexandros did not resist.

Did not speak.

Just stared at Cornelius with cold, empty eyes.

Theo approached the oilcloth bundle. Crouched. Examined it without touching.

"This is the stolen correspondence?"

"Yes," Cornelius said. His voice was rough. Shaking with exhaustion and fading adrenaline. "Alexandros retrieved it from the Intake Chute. He melted the service door to enter the building. He attempted to burn the library to cover his escape."

Theo's expression hardened.

He straightened. Turned to face Alexandros fully.

"Arson against a civic building during Spring Feast." Theo's voice was ice. "The Council Charter is explicit. The fine is death."

Alexandros's mask cracked.

Just for a moment.

Fear flashed across his face. Real. Raw.

Then the guards dragged him toward the doors.

Theo watched them go. Then turned back to Cornelius.

"You have a lot of explaining to do, Curator."

"I have documentation." Cornelius gestured with one wing toward where Zeph still held the ledger. Pain flared. He ignored it. "Complete incident logs. Timeline. Evidence chain. Everything you will need."

Theo's expression shifted. Something that might have been respect flickered in his eyes.

"You broke into a sealed crime scene."

"I entered my own library through an architectural vulnerability to prevent a murder suspect from destroying evidence."

"That is still breaking in."

"Then charge me." Cornelius's tail coiled. "After you read my report."

A long silence.

Then Theo sighed.

Rubbed his face with both hands.

"You are a dragon who runs a library," he said.

It was the same dismissal from weeks ago. The same reduction of Cornelius's role and importance.

But this time Theo was smiling.

"And apparently," he continued, "you are also the most stubborn investigator I have ever had the displeasure of working with."

It was not quite an apology.

But it was close enough.

Cornelius's wings folded. The injured one hurt terribly but he forced it down. Forced himself to stand straight.

Professional. Composed.

Even with blood on his claws and his hoard in chaos around him.

"The library is secure," he said. "The evidence is intact. Justice will be served."

"Yes," Theo agreed. "It will."

He gestured to the remaining guards. "Secure this room. No one touches anything until I have read that ledger and taken full statements."

The guards moved to comply.

Theo approached Cornelius. Stood looking down at the small dragon perched on the reading table.

"Off the record," he said quietly. "Thank you. For not giving up. For proving I was wrong."

Cornelius inclined his head. A small, precise gesture.

"You are welcome, Captain."

Theo nodded. Turned to coordinate with his guards.

Leaving Cornelius alone on his table.

In his library.

His hoard.

Damaged. Disordered. Coated in bookbinder's wax and blood.

But safe.

Across the room, Zeph emerged from behind the circulation desk. Still clutching the ledger. His hands shook.

"Is it over?" the boy asked. His voice was very small.

"Yes," Cornelius said. "It is over."

Zeph crossed the floor. Careful of the wax. Of the scattered evidence. Of the guards moving through the space.

He reached Cornelius's table.

Set the ledger down gently.

Then reached out and very carefully touched Cornelius's injured wing with one finger.

"You are hurt."

"It will heal."

"You saved the books."

"Of course I did." Cornelius's tail coiled. "They are my hoard."

Zeph's expression shifted. Something warm. Proud.

"Our hoard," he said.

And despite everything—the pain, the exhaustion, the chaos—

Cornelius felt his maw twitch.

Almost a smile.

"Yes," he agreed. "Our hoard."

# Chapter 19

# Chapter 19

The library was a disaster.

Cornelius perched on the circulation desk—his injured wing folded as well as it could manage—and surveyed the damage with a mix of pride and dismay.

The waxed aisle gleamed in the lamplight. Slick. Treacherous. Marked with scuff marks and blood. One of the Index ladders lay tilted across the southern archive entrance like a fallen barricade. Reading tables were overturned. Papers scattered. The bronze Intake bin stood open, its lid thrown back to reveal the empty interior.

And in the center of it all, Captain Theo Melas directed his guards with clipped efficiency.

"Careful with that vial. Do not—I repeat, *do not*—drop it. Liquid fire is banned for a reason." Theo pointed toward a guard handling the glass container with exaggerated caution. "Get it to Sister Photine. She will know how to neutralize it safely."

The guard nodded. Carried the vial toward the main doors as if it were made of spun sugar.

Cornelius's tail coiled. The vial that had nearly destroyed his entire collection was leaving the building. Good.

His gaze shifted to Alexandros Doukas.

The man stood near the eastern wall. Manacles locked around his wrists. Two guards flanking him. Blood still streaked his neck and face from Cornelius's claws. His expensive coat was shredded.

But his expression remained cold. Empty.

As if being arrested for murder was merely an inconvenience.

Cornelius's scales prickled.

That emptiness was worse than rage. Rage could be understood. Predicted.

Emptiness suggested calculation. Control.

A man who had not yet accepted defeat.

Footsteps echoed from the main entrance.

Cornelius turned.

Sophia Doukas stepped through the broken doors.

She moved with the same composed grace Cornelius remembered from their confrontation at the Doukas estate. Dark hair pinned back. Blue dress—the one with the carefully mended hem—now slightly rumpled from hurried travel.

Her gaze swept the library. Took in the chaos. The guards. The overturned furniture.

Her brother in manacles.

She went very still.

"Alexandros?" Her voice was thin. Strained. "What—"

Theo intercepted her before she could cross the floor. Raised one hand. Professional. Firm.

"Sophia Doukas. I need you to remain where you are."

She stopped. Blinked at him. Confusion flickering across her face.

Or an excellent imitation of confusion.

Cornelius watched her carefully. He had documented her involvement. Had traced the blue thread from her hem to Sister Photine's sandal. Had heard her argument with Elias about wards and sequences.

But had she known about the murder?

That remained unclear.

Behind Sophia, another figure entered.

Captain Mago Hanno.

The orc smuggler filled the doorway. Broad shoulders. Scarred hands. An expression that suggested he would rather be anywhere else.

Theo's eyebrows rose.

"Captain Hanno. This is unexpected."

Mago's gaze found Cornelius. Held for a moment. Something that might have been respect flickered in those dark eyes.

"Got word you were hauling in Alexandros Doukas for murder." Mago's voice was a low rumble. "Figured I should be here. Since my name keeps coming up in this mess."

"You are not under arrest," Theo said carefully.

"Good." Mago crossed massive arms. "I would like to keep it that way. So I am here to make sure everyone understands my role. Which was minimal."

Cornelius's tail twitched.

The smuggler was covering his exposure. Smart.

And his presence meant all the major players were now in one room.

Theo turned toward Cornelius. His expression shifted. Recognition. Resignation.

"Curator Drake. I believe you have... documentation regarding tonight's events?"

It was phrased as a question.

But the weight behind it was clear.

Explain. Now.

Cornelius straightened. Ignored the ache in his wing. The exhaustion pulling at his scales.

This was his moment.

The reveal.

The careful unraveling of threads that proved motive, method, and murderer.

He had spent weeks chasing this truth. Had made mistakes. Had publicly accused the wrong person. Had been choked in an alley and threatened with fire.

But he had been right about the core crime.

And now he would prove it.

"Yes," Cornelius said. His voice was steady. Clear. The tone he used when delivering particularly complex cataloging lectures. "I have documentation. And an explanation."

He gestured with one claw toward the oilcloth bundle that sat carefully preserved on a nearby table. Guarded by two watchmen.

"It begins with those letters."

Every gaze in the room shifted to the bundle.

Forty years of Kallistos correspondence. Tied with ribbon gone brittle with age.

"Those are family documents," Sophia said. Her voice was too quick. Too sharp. "Private property. You have no right—"

"They are stolen property," Cornelius corrected. "Removed from the Kallistos family vault during an illegal breach six days ago. The same breach that resulted in the death of Elias of Tyre."

Theo nodded. Gestured for Cornelius to continue.

Cornelius's claws tapped against the circulation desk. A thinking rhythm.

"The crime began with a simple commission. Sophia Doukas hired Elias of Tyre to steal these letters from the Kallistos vault." He looked directly at Sophia. "You wanted leverage. House Kallistos has dominated the luxury tile market for generations. But their grip relies on reputation. Respectability."

Sophia's face went pale.

"These letters contain evidence of a long-running affair between the Kallistos patriarch and his mistress," Cornelius continued. "Scandalous. Damaging. Worth a fortune to the right buyer. Or invaluable as blackmail material against the family directly."

"I never—" Sophia started.

"You argued with Elias in the market square," Cornelius said. His voice was calm. Factual. "Four days before his death. You discussed wards. A sequence. You withheld payment until the task was completed. I witnessed this myself."

Sophia's mouth snapped shut.

Theo was watching her now. Evaluating.

"But the commission was complicated," Cornelius said. "Elias needed help. The Kallistos vault is protected by ancient wards. By a physical seal of enchanted iron. He could not breach it alone."

His gaze shifted to Alexandros.

"Your brother possesses the necessary skills. Access to alchemical compounds through the Doukas tile workshop. Expertise in high-heat kilns. Knowledge of magical catalysts."

Alexandros's expression did not change.

"Elias recruited Alexandros to melt the vault seal," Cornelius continued. "Using a concentrated kiln accelerant—the same compound that fires your tiles at extreme temperatures—combined with a magical catalyst to superheat the iron."

Theo leaned forward slightly. Interested.

"The method worked," Cornelius said. "The seal melted. The vault opened. But there was a complication."

He paused. Let the silence stretch.

"Elias got greedy."

Sophia's breath caught.

"Elias was already in debt to Captain Mago Hanno," Cornelius said. He nodded toward the orc. "Gambling debts. Significant enough that Mago was considering... aggressive collection methods."

Mago grunted. Did not deny it.

"Elias promised to repay the debt with profits from a big score. What he called 'Kallistos gold.'" Cornelius's tail coiled. "But he lied to everyone involved. To Mago, he claimed he was stealing literal gold. To Sophia, he claimed he was stealing glaze formulas. To his actual client—Eudora of Naxos—he claimed he was stealing tile recipes for industrial espionage."

Theo's eyes widened slightly.

"Multiple clients," he said slowly. "Multiple lies."

"Exactly." Cornelius's wings rustled. "Elias intended to take payment from Eudora—fifty silver crescents hidden in a correspondence folder delivered to the vault. Then steal the *actual* valuable contents—these letters—and sell them separately. Likely through Mago's network."

He looked at Sophia.

"You would never receive what you paid for. Alexandros would be implicated in a vault breach for nothing. And Elias would walk away with everyone's money."

Sophia's hands trembled.

"I did not know," she whispered. "I swear I did not know he was planning—"

"You did not know about the double-cross," Cornelius agreed. "But you knew about the theft. You commissioned it."

Theo made a note.

Cornelius turned his full attention to Alexandros.

"Your brother discovered Elias's betrayal. Perhaps Elias bragged to the wrong person. Perhaps Alexandros noticed inconsistencies in the plan. Regardless—" Cornelius's voice hardened. "—Alexandros decided to solve the problem permanently."

Alexandros's mouth curved. Not quite a smile.

"Go on, Curator," he said. His voice was silk over steel. "Tell them how you think I did it."

Cornelius's claws flexed.

"You melted the vault seal as planned. But the accelerant produces toxic fumes when burned in a confined space. Burnt almond scent. Ozone residue. I documented both at the crime scene."

He gestured toward his incident ledger. Still sitting on the desk beside him.

"Initial analysis suggested cyanide poisoning. But Sister Photine certified natural causes. Heart failure induced by stress." Cornelius's tail lashed once. "She was partially correct. Elias did die from respiratory collapse. But not from a classic poison."

Theo was rivianeted now. Listening with complete focus.

"He died from inhaling concentrated kiln-accelerant fumes in the poorly ventilated vault." Cornelius's voice was steady. Clinical. "The same fumes that melted the iron seal. High heat. Magical catalyst. In a small stone room with no air circulation."

He looked directly at Alexandros.

"You knew the fumes would be lethal. You melted the seal while Elias was inside the vault. Closed the door. Let the fumes do their work."

Sophia made a choked sound.

Alexandros's expression remained calm.

"Clever," he said. "But can you prove intent? Perhaps it was an accident. A miscalculation."

"Your behavior afterward proves intent," Cornelius said. "You stole the correspondence. Hid it inside the library's Intake Chute—the only location where the vault's inventory wards would not trigger an alarm. You planned to retrieve it later, after the initial investigation concluded."

His wing ached. He ignored it.

"But you made mistakes. You left trace evidence. The same chemical signature on your hands. The same burnt-almond scent that clung to your clothes when you assaulted me in the alley."

Theo's gaze snapped to Alexandros.

"You assaulted the Curator?"

"He grabbed my throat," Cornelius said. His voice was flat. Matter-of-fact. "Threatened to stage an accident. To silence my investigation."

Theo's expression darkened.

"And tonight," Cornelius continued, "you returned to recover the letters. Used the same alchemical fire to melt the service entrance lock. Retrieved the correspondence from the Intake bin. Attempted to burn the entire library when escape became impossible."

He gestured toward where the vial had sat.

"Liquid fire. Banned by Council decree. Carried into a civic building during Spring Feast."

The room went very quiet.

Sophia was staring at her brother now. Horror and disbelief warring across her face.

"Alexandros," she whispered. "Tell me it is not true. Tell me you did not—"

"I cleaned up a mess." Alexandros's voice was ice. No emotion. No regret. "Elias was a liability. Greedy. Stupid. He would have exposed all of us."

Sophia's face crumpled.

"You killed him."

"I solved a problem." Alexandros's gaze was steady. Cold. "Which I would not have needed to do if you had controlled your hired help better."

Theo moved.

Fast. Deliberate.

He crossed the space between himself and Alexandros in three strides.

"Alexandros Doukas. You are under arrest for the murder of Elias of Tyre. For theft of Kallistos family property. For assault on Curator Cornelius Drake. For illegal possession and deployment of banned alchemical weapons. And for attempted arson of a civic building during Spring Feast."

He nodded to the guards.

"Take him to the holding cells. Separate from general population."

The guards moved. Gripped Alexandros's arms.

Began to pull him toward the doors.

Alexandros did not resist.

But as he passed Cornelius, he stopped.

Met the dragon's gaze.

"You should have let it burn," he said quietly. "The library. The letters. All of it. Would have been simpler."

Cornelius's wings flared.

"Nothing about truth is simple," he said. "But it is necessary."

Alexandros's mouth twitched.

Then the guards pulled him away.

Out through the broken doors.

Into the night.

Gone.

Silence settled over the library.

Sophia stood frozen. Pale. Shaking.

Theo turned to her.

"Sophia Doukas. You commissioned theft of private property. Conspiracy to commit industrial espionage. I am placing you under arrest pending formal charges."

She did not fight. Did not argue.

Just nodded.

Numb.

A guard moved forward. No manacles this time. Just a firm hand on her elbow. Guiding her toward the exit.

She paused as she passed Cornelius.

"I did not want anyone to die," she whispered. "I just wanted—"

"To win," Cornelius said. Not unkindly. Simply factual. "To level the market. To hurt a rival family."

Her eyes filled with tears.

"Yes."

"Then you should have chosen a better method." Cornelius's tail coiled. "And a better partner."

She flinched.

Then the guard led her away.

Theo watched them go. Then turned to Mago.

"Captain Hanno. Your role?"

Mago shrugged.

"Elias owed me money. Promised to pay it back with proceeds from a job. He died before paying. I wrote off the debt." The orc's voice was flat. Practical. "That is all."

"You did not commission the theft?"

"No."

"Did not hire Elias to steal from the Kallistos vault?"

"No."

"Did not provide tools, access, or assistance?"

"No." Mago's gaze was steady. "I loan money. I collect debts. I do not murder people over silver when I can simply take their ship as collateral."

Theo studied him for a long moment.

Then nodded.

"You are free to go. But I will have questions. Formal statements. Documentation of Elias's debt."

"You will have them." Mago turned toward the doors. Paused. Looked back at Cornelius. "You are a persistent little dragon."

Cornelius inclined his head.

"I am a Curator. Persistence is required."

Something that might have been respect flickered across Mago's scarred face.

Then he was gone too.

Leaving only Cornelius, Theo, Zeph, and the scattered guards processing evidence.

Theo approached the circulation desk.

Looked up at where Cornelius perched. Injured wing. Blood on his claws. Scales disheveled.

"You broke into a sealed crime scene," Theo said.

"I exploited an architectural vulnerability to protect evidence from destruction," Cornelius corrected.

Theo's mouth twitched.

Almost a smile.

"You conducted an unauthorized investigation."

"I documented observations in my personal incident log."

"You set traps inside a civic building."

"I utilized available resources to contain a dangerous suspect."

"You fought a man twice your size."

"I defended my hoard."

Theo laughed.

Actually laughed.

It was a rough sound. Exhausted. But genuine.

"You are *impossible*," he said.

"I am thorough," Cornelius replied.

Theo shook his head. But his expression had softened.

"The Council is going to have questions. About procedures. About jurisdiction. About a dragon Curator taking over a murder investigation."

"I have documentation." Cornelius gestured toward the ledger. "Complete timeline. Chain of evidence. Forensic analysis. Everything required for formal prosecution."

Theo picked up the ledger. Flipped through pages. His eyebrows rose.

"This is... extraordinarily detailed."

"I am a librarian. Detail is my profession."

Theo closed the ledger carefully.

"This will be the backbone of the case. Without it—" He paused. Met Cornelius's gaze. "—we would have nothing. Alexandros would walk. Sophia would deny involvement. Elias's death would remain classified as natural causes."

Cornelius's scales settled.

Validation.

Official. Public.

It felt... good.

"The Watch appreciates your assistance," Theo said formally. Then, quieter: "I appreciate it. You were right. About the murder. About the cover-up. About all of it."

He extended a hand.

Cornelius looked at it. The human gesture of respect. Partnership.

He lifted one claw. Placed it carefully in Theo's palm.

They shook.

"If you ever want to consult on future cases," Theo said, "the Watch would be interested in your... unique perspective."

Cornelius's wings rustled.

"I am a Curator. Not a detective."

"You are a dragon who runs a library," Theo said. That same phrase from before. But the tone was different now. Warm. Almost affectionate. "Which apparently makes you the best investigator I have worked with."

Cornelius felt something warm unfurl in his chest.

Pride. Recognition.

Belonging.

"I will consider your offer," he said carefully. "If the cases do not interfere with my primary duties."

"Fair enough." Theo released his claw. Stepped back. "For now—get that wing looked at. And try not to break into any more sealed buildings."

"I make no promises."

Theo laughed again. Turned toward his guards.

"Finish evidence collection. I want this room photographed and documented before we close the scene."

The guards moved to comply.

Theo paused at the main doors. Looked back.

"Thank you, Cornelius. For not giving up. For proving me wrong."

Then he was gone.

Leaving Cornelius alone on the circulation desk.

In his library.

His hoard.

Still a disaster. Still coated in wax and blood and the residue of violence.

But safe.

Protected.

Whole.

Beside him, Zeph climbed up onto the desk. Sat cross-legged. Shoulder almost touching Cornelius's wing.

"We did it," the boy said. His voice was soft. Amazed.

"Yes," Cornelius agreed. "We did."

"Are you going to take Theo's offer? Become a consulting detective?"

Cornelius considered this.

The idea of more cases. More investigations. More chaos disrupting his careful order.

But also—more truth uncovered. More justice served. More protection for the vulnerable.

"Perhaps," he said slowly. "Occasionally."

Zeph grinned.

"I think that means yes."

Cornelius's tail coiled around the boy's ankle. Gentle. Affectionate.

"It means we will discuss it. After the library is restored. After my wing heals. After—" He looked at the waxed floor. "—after we clean this entire disaster and return everything to proper order."

"So never," Zeph said. Still grinning.

"Eventually," Cornelius corrected.

They sat in comfortable silence.

The guards worked around them. Careful. Respectful of the space.

Outside, the Spring Feast continued. Distant music. Laughter. The city celebrating.

Inside the library, order slowly returned.

Piece by piece.

Book by book.

Exactly as it should be.

And Cornelius—small dragon, meticulous Curator, accidental detective—felt his scales finally settle.

The case was closed.

Justice was served.

His hoard was safe.

Everything else could wait until morning.

# Chapter 20

# Chapter 20

Seven days after the arrest of Alexandros Doukas, the library was finally quiet.

Not the tense, waiting quiet of a crime scene. Not the oppressive silence of fear.

The good quiet. The kind Cornelius had originally designed the space to hold.

He perched on the circulation desk—his injured wing now healed enough to fold properly—and surveyed his domain with deep satisfaction.

The waxed section of the main aisle had been scrubbed clean. Three times. By Cornelius himself, because no one else understood the proper way to remove bookbinder's wax from antique stone without damaging the surface.

The Index ladder had been repaired and returned to its rail. The wheels had been oiled. The wood reinforced. It now hung precisely where it belonged, parallel to the eastern stacks at a forty-five-degree angle.

Perfect.

The reading tables had been righted. The scattered papers collected and re-filed according to proper archival protocol. The bronze Intake bin had been polished until it gleamed.

Order had been restored.

Piece by meticulous piece.

Cornelius's tail coiled with pleasure.

The library looked like itself again. Smelled like itself again. Vanilla and old paper and the faintest trace of fresh mint from the bundle hanging in his office.

Safe.

The main doors stood open. Sunlight—no. Lamplight. The amber glass of the dome cast warm light across the reading floor. Patrons moved through the stacks. Quiet. Respectful.

As they should be.

Everything was exactly as it had been before Elias of Tyre delivered a suspicious package and set a murder investigation in motion.

Except.

Cornelius's gaze drifted to the back corner. The Shadow Zone where the Intake bin sat in permanent twilight.

Except for what was currently happening there.

Zeph knelt beside an open storage crate. The oilcloth bundle—forty years of Kallistos correspondence, now formally released from Watch custody—sat carefully unwrapped beside him.

The boy wore white cotton gloves. The kind used for handling fragile documents.

Cornelius had insisted.

Zeph had not argued.

Progress.

"How many left?" Cornelius called across the reading floor. His voice was low. Library-appropriate.

"Maybe twenty?" Zeph did not look up from his work. He was sorting the letters by date. Checking each one for damage. Making notes on a preservation assessment form.

The form Cornelius had created specifically for this task.

Also progress.

Cornelius's wings rustled.

The letters would be permanently archived in the History section. Not Scandal. Not Secrets.

History.

Because that was what they were now. A record of human choices. Mistakes. The messy reality of lived experience.

Not evidence. Not blackmail material.

Just... life. Documented.

Cornelius had spent considerable time deciding on the classification. History felt correct. Neutral. Factual.

The Kallistos family had been consulted. They had agreed to donate the letters to the library's permanent collection rather than destroy them.

A wise choice.

Destruction of primary sources was never the answer.

Even when those sources were embarrassing.

The main doors opened.

Cornelius's head snapped toward the sound. His scales rippled. Ready to enforce silence if necessary.

But it was only the courier.

Young woman. Human. Wore the blue sash of a registered city messenger.

She approached the circulation desk with appropriate hesitation. Clearly aware she was entering a dragon's territory.

"Delivery for Curator Drake," she said. Her voice was soft. Respectful.

Cornelius approved.

"Leave it on the desk," he said.

She set down two items. A small wooden crate. And a sealed envelope.

Then she departed. Quickly.

Also appropriate.

Cornelius examined the crate first.

It was palm-sized. Dark wood. Beautifully crafted joints. The lid was secured with a simple brass latch.

He flicked the latch open with one claw.

Inside, nestled in clean straw, were dates.

Plump. Golden. Expensive.

The kind sold in the luxury market. Imported from distant orchards where the climate was perfect and the soil rich.

A small card rested on top of the straw. Thick paper. Good quality.

Cornelius plucked it out. Read the message written in bold, blocky handwriting.

*For the persistent little dragon. Trade is mutual. Information for dates. Fair deal.*

*—M.H.*

Mago Hanno.

Cornelius's tail twitched.

The smuggler had sent tribute.

Not an apology. Not gratitude.

Tribute.

Recognition of a debt paid. Of a service rendered.

Cornelius had provided information that kept Mago out of a murder investigation. Mago was returning the favor with a gift appropriate to Cornelius's tastes.

The dates were good. Cornelius could smell their sweetness even through the crate.

He carefully closed the lid. Set the crate aside for later consumption.

Then turned his attention to the envelope.

This one was cream-colored. Expensive paper. Sealed with blue wax.

The Doukas family crest.

Cornelius's claws scraped against the desk.

He did not want to open it.

But duty required acknowledgment of all official correspondence.

He slit the seal. Unfolded the letter inside.

The handwriting was feminine. Elegant. Shaking slightly in places.

Sophia Doukas.

*Curator Drake,*

*The Council has levied fines against House Doukas for our role in the theft and conspiracy. I am writing to settle the portion owed specifically to the library for damages incurred during the investigation.*

*Enclosed is a bank draft for two hundred silver crescents. This should cover repairs to the floors, furniture, and any materials damaged during the incident.*

*I do not ask for forgiveness. I do not deserve it.*

*But I wanted you to know that my brother acted alone in the murder of Elias of Tyre. I commissioned a theft. Not a death. That distinction may not matter to you. But it matters to me.*

*House Doukas will not contest the charges. We will accept the Council's judgment.*

*Thank you for protecting the city's knowledge. Even when it implicated my family.*

*—Sophia Doukas*

Cornelius read the letter twice.

Then carefully folded it and set it beside the crate of dates.

Two hundred silver crescents was generous. More than generous. The actual repair costs had been perhaps seventy.

The rest was conscience money.

Sophia buying peace. Or at least trying to.

Cornelius's tail coiled.

He would accept it.

Not because he forgave her. Forgiveness was not his to grant. Elias's family—if he had any—held that right.

But he would accept the payment because it was offered in good faith. Because Sophia had acknowledged her role. Because she had not tried to minimize or deflect.

That mattered.

Accountability mattered.

He would deposit the draft. Use the surplus to purchase new materials for the bindery. Perhaps commission repairs to the Intake Chute's internal mechanisms.

Turn the money into something useful.

Something that served the library.

The hoard.

Movement in the Shadow Zone caught his attention.

Zeph stood. Stretched. His spine made an audible pop.

Then he lifted the final bundle of letters—now neatly organized, assessed, and wrapped in acid-free tissue—and carried them toward the History stacks.

Cornelius watched the boy move through the library with easy confidence. No hesitation. No uncertainty about where things belonged.

Zeph knew the layout now. Knew the systems. Understood the logic of Cornelius's carefully constructed order.

Could navigate it. Contribute to it.

Maintain it.

The boy disappeared into the stacks. Cornelius heard the soft sound of a drawer sliding open. Documents being placed inside. The drawer closing with a precise click.

Then Zeph emerged. Pulled off the white gloves. Tucked them into his pocket.

He crossed the reading floor and stopped in front of the circulation desk.

"Done," he said. "All forty years. Sorted by date. Preservation notes filed. The whole collection is in Drawer H-12."

"Location logged in the master index?" Cornelius asked.

"Yep. Under 'Kallistos Correspondence' and cross-referenced with 'Personal Papers, Nineteenth Century.'"

Cornelius's wings settled.

"Acceptable work."

Zeph grinned.

That infuriating, self-satisfied grin that made him look younger than sixteen.

"Acceptable," he repeated. "Wow. High praise."

"Do not push your luck."

The boy's grin widened.

Cornelius's tail twitched. Almost smiling. Not quite.

"I also finished the hazardous materials incident report," Zeph said. He pulled a folded document from his back pocket. Set it on the desk. "Captain Melas wanted written confirmation that the liquid fire vial was surrendered to Sister Photine for neutralization. So I documented the chain of custody. Witness signatures. Timestamps. Everything."

Cornelius picked up the report.

Scanned it.

His scales rippled with pleased surprise.

The formatting was correct. The language clear and precise. The timestamps accurate down to the minute.

No spelling errors. No smudged ink.

Professional work.

"This is..." Cornelius paused. Searching for appropriate acknowledgment. "...very well done, Zeph."

The boy's expression shifted.

Surprise. Then something warmer.

Pride.

"Thanks," Zeph said. His voice was quieter. More genuine. "I used your incident ledger as a template. Figured if it was good enough to build a murder case, it was good enough for a hazmat report."

Cornelius felt something warm unfurl in his chest.

Not just pride in the work.

Pride in the worker.

Zeph had learned. Had listened. Had taken Cornelius's methods and applied them independently.

Had grown.

"You have earned the afternoon off," Cornelius said.

Zeph blinked.

"Wait. Really?"

"The archive work is complete. The incident reports are filed. The library is restored to proper order." Cornelius's tail coiled. "And you have been working diligently for seven consecutive days without complaint. Time off is appropriate."

"Huh." Zeph looked genuinely shocked. "Okay. Yeah. Thanks."

He started to turn. Then paused.

"Are you sure you do not need me? I can stay if—"

"I am certain." Cornelius waved one claw in dismissal. "Go. Enjoy the Feast. Eat something excessively sweet. Complain about your employer to your peers. Return tomorrow at the usual time."

Zeph's grin returned.

"You know I am just gonna come back with pastries and crumbs everywhere, right?"

"I am resigned to this inevitability."

"Cool." Zeph gave a lazy salute. "See you tomorrow, Boss."

He walked toward the main doors. Loose-limbed. Relaxed.

Moved through the library like he belonged there.

Because he did.

Cornelius watched him go.

Watched the boy step out into the late afternoon. Into the noise and chaos of the Spring Feast still rumbling through the market square beyond.

Watched him vanish into the crowd of humans and mythologicals and all the messy, unpredictable life that Cornelius had spent decades trying to keep outside his sanctuary.

The doors closed.

Silence settled over the reading floor.

Cornelius sat very still.

The library was empty except for three patrons quietly browsing the eastern stacks. The amber light was warm. The air smelled of vanilla and paper and fresh mint.

Perfect.

Exactly as he had always wanted it.

Quiet. Ordered. Safe.

His hoard. His sanctuary.

And yet.

Cornelius's tail uncurled slowly.

He realized—with some surprise—that he was already anticipating tomorrow morning.

Anticipating the sound of the side door opening. Boots on stone. The rustle of a bag that definitely contained something sticky and crumb-producing.

Zeph's voice calling out a greeting. Too loud. Too casual.

Disorder walking through the door.

And Cornelius would scold him. Of course. Would lecture about proper food storage and the dangers of attracting insects.

But he would also listen to whatever gossip the boy had collected. Would assign him tasks. Would watch him work with that growing competence and confidence.

Would feel that warm unfurling in his chest again.

Because.

Because the silence was good.

But Zeph's noise had become part of the library's rhythm.

Part of the hoard.

Cornelius's gaze drifted to his private incident ledger. Still sitting on the corner of the desk where he had left it after Theo returned it.

The entire investigation documented inside. Every observation. Every mistake. Every correction.

The backbone of the case.

He opened it to the final entry. The one he had written this morning before the courier arrived.

*Day 43. Spring Feast, Final Day.*

*Library Status: Restored. Operations: Normal. Patron Traffic: Moderate.*

*Evidence from the Kallistos Vault Incident has been permanently archived in the History section (Drawer H-12). Legally released by Watch custody. Accessibility: Restricted, family permission required.*

*All damaged materials have been repaired or replaced. Physical infrastructure restored to pre-incident condition.*

*Fines and restitution received from involved parties. Funds allocated to library maintenance and acquisitions.*

*Apprentice Zephyr Taraki has completed all assigned archival tasks to acceptable standards. Performance: Improved. Competence: Verified.*

*Case Status:*

Cornelius picked up his pen.

Dipped it in ink.

Paused.

Then wrote in his careful, precise script:

*Closed.*

He set the pen down.

Closed the ledger.

Let his claws rest on the worn leather cover for a long moment.

It was done.

The investigation. The chaos. The violence that had violated his sanctuary.

All of it resolved. Categorized. Filed away in proper order.

Alexandros Doukas awaited trial in Council custody. The charges were extensive. The evidence overwhelming.

Justice would be served.

Sophia Doukas had accepted responsibility for her role. Had paid restitution. Would face her own consequences.

The legal system was handling the rest.

As it should.

Cornelius's tail coiled with satisfaction.

He had done his part. Had protected his hoard. Had pursued truth with the same meticulous precision he applied to cataloging manuscripts.

Had proven that a dragon who ran a library was still a dragon.

And a dragon defending its hoard was not to be underestimated.

Even by murderers.

Even by the Watch.

Even by—Cornelius allowed himself a small, private moment of vanity—anyone.

His gaze swept the reading floor one final time.

The warm amber light. The honey-colored stone. The rows of shelves extending into comfortable shadows.

Thousands of books. Scrolls. Manuscripts. Documents.

Knowledge preserved. Protected. Accessible to those who sought it.

His hoard.

And tomorrow Zeph would return. Would bring noise and questions and probably crumbs.

Would call the library "ours" in that casual, proprietary way.

Would mean it.

Cornelius's wings settled against his back.

He had learned something these past seven weeks.

Order was important. Necessary. The foundation of civilization.

But perfect order was sterile. Lifeless.

A library full of books but no readers was just a tomb.

A hoard with no one to share it was just loneliness with better furniture.

He needed the silence.

But he also needed Zeph's noise.

Needed Imelda's quiet wisdom. Theo's grudging respect. The patrons browsing the stacks. The spring festival chaos bleeding through the walls.

Needed life.

Messy. Unpredictable. Impossible to fully catalog.

Life.

Cornelius picked up the crate of dates. Opened the lid. Selected one.

Bit into it carefully.

Sweet. Rich. Perfect.

He ate it slowly. Savoring each bite.

Then reached for the next entry in his work queue.

A damaged folio that needed rebinding. Delicate work. Precise.

The kind of task he loved.

He spread his tools across the desk. Selected a bone folder. Examined the spine.

Got to work.

Outside, the Spring Feast continued. Music. Laughter. The city celebrating.

Inside the library, Cornelius Drake—small dragon, meticulous Curator, accidental detective—restored a broken book.

One page at a time.

Exactly as it should be.

The library was quiet.

The library was safe.

The hoard was whole.

And tomorrow his apprentice would return.

Everything was in order.
