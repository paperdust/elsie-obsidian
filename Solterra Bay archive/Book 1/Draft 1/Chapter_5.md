# Chapter 5

The library was dark.

Cornelius preferred it that way.

He had extinguished the reading lamps an hour ago and locked the front door with the iron bar usually reserved for storm season. The amber light from the dome above had dimmed to a glow barely brighter than coals. Outside, the Spring Feast roared on—drums, laughter, the crash of something heavy hitting cobblestones.

Inside, silence.

Almost.

Cornelius's claws clicked against stone as he paced the length of the main floor. Back and forth. Circulation desk to the History section. History section to the chained vault door. Vault door back to the desk.

His tail lashed with each turn.

*You are a dragon who runs a library.*

Theo's words circled his mind like carrion birds. Dismissive. Final. As though a century of guardianship meant nothing. As though Cornelius's detailed observations, his forensic deductions, his *correct assessment of a murder* could be waved away because he did not wear the armor of the Watch.

He stopped beside his desk and stared at the private ledger lying open in the amber glow.

*Official investigation is compromised or incompetent. Proceed independently.*

He had written that.

But what did "proceed independently" actually mean?

Observe? He had done that. Document? His ledger was full of documentation. Report findings? To whom? Theo had made his position clear. Sister Photine had certified natural causes. The vault was sealed. The case was closed.

And a murderer walked free.

Cornelius's claws dug into the wood of his desk. The grain splintered slightly under the pressure.

Unacceptable.

Someone had violated his sanctuary. Melted his wards. Stolen correspondence. Left a body on his floor.

And the official response was to chain the door, pocket the key, and tell him to *stay out of the way*.

His wings flared.

No.

He would not stay out of the way.

If the Watch would not pursue justice, then he would have to define it himself.

Cornelius moved to the supply cabinet and retrieved a blank ledger sheet, a stick of charcoal, and his sharpest quill. He carried them back to the desk and spread the parchment flat.

At the top, he wrote in careful script: *Suspects and Connections.*

Then he began.

*Sophia Doukas.* He printed her name in block letters on the left side of the page. Beneath it, he listed what he knew:

- Argued with Elias (Day 1, market square).
- Discussed "wards," "sequence," and withheld payment.
- Blue thread from her clothing found on Sister Photine's sandal.

Cornelius drew a line connecting Sophia's name to a second entry: *Sister Photine.*

- Certified "natural causes" despite evidence of poison.
- Checked for specific skin reactions (prior knowledge of toxin type?).
- Recent contact with Sophia or Doukas workshop (blue thread).

A third line extended to *Alexandros Doukas.*

- Intercepted Eudora in the alley (Day 2, evening).
- Wore heavy gloves in warm weather (concealing residue? burns?).
- Steered conversation away from further inquiry.

Cornelius tapped the quill against his snout, thinking.

The Doukas family was everywhere in this. Three separate individuals, three separate encounters, all connected to the theft or its aftermath.

He added a fourth name to the right side of the page: *Eudora of Naxos.*

- Sender of the stolen package.
- Hired Elias as courier.
- Showed no grief for his death; prioritized property recovery.
- Contents of package unknown (declared private).

And then, reluctantly, a fifth: *Petros Kallistos.*

- Vault owner.
- Found drunk in archives with ventilation schematic.
- Admitted discussing vault wards with a stranger at a tavern.
- Description of stranger: large, eastern-accented man.

Cornelius paused. The "large, eastern-accented man" did not yet have a name, but he had a likely candidate.

He added a sixth entry at the top of the page: *Captain Mago Hanno.*

- Orc smuggler.
- Observed watching the library the morning after the crime.
- Known for trafficking in restricted goods.

Cornelius sat back and studied the web of names and lines.

Six people.

Six threads that might connect to the same crime—or to different crimes that overlapped in his library like badly shelved volumes.

But which one had wielded the poison? Which one had stolen the correspondence?

And, most importantly, *why*?

Footsteps sounded on the stairs behind him.

Cornelius turned.

Zeph descended from the archive level, carrying a folded blanket and a waterskin. He stopped when he saw the parchment spread across Cornelius's desk.

"You're making a list," Zeph said.

"I am creating a case structure." Cornelius gestured to the page. "The official investigation may have concluded, but the actual crime remains unsolved. Therefore, I am cataloging all known variables."

Zeph set the blanket on a nearby chair and moved closer. His gaze tracked the names and lines. "That's... a lot of people."

"Six confirmed points of interest. Multiple intersections. Insufficient data to determine primacy." Cornelius tapped Sophia's name. "But this one is the most direct connection to the victim. She argued with Elias the day before his death. She referenced the wards and a 'task.' And she is linked to both Photine and Alexandros."

"So she's the one who planned it?"

"Possibly. Or she is part of a coordinated effort." Cornelius drew another line, this time connecting Eudora to the stolen package. "Eudora sent the package. Elias delivered it. Sophia hired Elias—or pressured him—to complete a 'task' involving the wards. The package likely contained the tool used to breach the seal."

"And Mago?" Zeph pointed to the smuggler's name.

"Unknown." Cornelius's tail curled in frustration. "He was present the morning after, watching the library. He fits Petros's description of the man at the tavern. But I have no direct evidence linking him to the theft itself."

Zeph leaned against the desk, arms crossed. "So what do we do? We can't just walk up to all six of them and ask if they're murderers."

"No. We cannot." Cornelius folded his wings. "But we can observe. We can follow the threads and see where they lead."

"You mean spy on them."

"I mean conduct surveillance and gather corroborating evidence." Cornelius adjusted his spectacles. "If we can establish a clear chain of action—who hired whom, who supplied what, who stood to gain—we can reconstruct the crime and identify the primary actor."

"And then what? Give it to Theo?"

Cornelius's claws scored the wood again.

That was the question, was it not?

Even if he built an airtight case, even if he documented every connection and presented it on a silver platter, would Theo listen? Or would he dismiss it again as the over-reaching of "a dragon who runs a library"?

Cornelius looked down at his ledger. At the careful script and precise lines. At the *Inventory of Truth* he had been building since the first moment Elias had walked through the door with his suspicious package.

Truth mattered.

Evidence mattered.

And if the institutions of the city would not defend them, then he would.

"Then we will present it to someone who cannot ignore it," Cornelius said. His voice was steady. Resolved. "The Council. The Healer's Hall. The families involved. We will make the truth so clear, so thoroughly documented, that dismissing it becomes impossible."

Zeph studied him. "You're really doing this. Going full vigilante librarian."

"I am pursuing justice within the boundaries of observation and documentation. That is not vigilantism. That is scholarship."

"Pretty sure Theo's not gonna see it that way."

"Captain Melas has already demonstrated his position." Cornelius turned back to the parchment. "He believes I should 'stay out of the way.' I intend to do so. Quietly. While conducting my own inquiry parallel to his closed case."

"And if the murderer figures out we're investigating?"

Cornelius met Zeph's eyes. "Then we become targets. I acknowledged that risk yesterday. It has not changed."

"Yeah, but yesterday was theoretical." Zeph's voice was quieter now. "Today you're drawing maps and planning to follow people. That's... real."

"Yes. It is." Cornelius folded his wings tighter. "You may still withdraw. I will not—"

"I'm not withdrawing." Zeph straightened. "I'm just making sure you know what you're getting into. Because once we start this, we can't just stop if it gets scary."

"I am aware."

"And you're still doing it?"

Cornelius looked at the vault door. The iron chains gleamed dully in the amber light. Beyond it, the Spring Feast noise rose and fell like tide—chaotic, uncontrolled, indifferent to his sanctuary.

Someone had brought that chaos inside.

Had melted his wards. Poisoned a man. Stolen what was meant to be protected.

And then the system—the Law, the Watch, the institutions he had believed in—had failed to respond.

He could accept many things. Disorder in the square. Noise during the Feast. Even the occasional patron who dog-eared pages.

But he could not accept a murderer walking free because it was *inconvenient* to investigate properly.

"Yes," Cornelius said. "I am still doing it."

Zeph nodded slowly. "Okay. Then where do we start?"

Cornelius turned back to the parchment and tapped Sophia's name.

"The woman who argued with the dead man," he said. "She is the clearest connection to the crime. She knew the victim. She referenced the wards. She is part of a family with means, motive, and access to alchemical materials." He drew a circle around her name. "We start with Sophia Doukas."

"And do what? Follow her around?"

"Observe her habits. Note her associations. Determine where she goes and whom she meets." Cornelius pulled out a fresh sheet of parchment. "If she orchestrated the theft, she will need to move the stolen correspondence. Sell it. Deliver it. Use it for leverage. That action will require contact with others—a buyer, a client, an accomplice."

"And when she does, we see who it is."

"Precisely." Cornelius began writing a new list: *Observational Objectives—Sophia Doukas.*

- Confirm daily routine (workshop, home, market).
- Identify known associates beyond family.
- Monitor for hand-offs, payments, or suspicious meetings.
- Note any alchemical materials or tools in her possession.

"We will need to be subtle," Cornelius said. "She must not know she is being watched. If she becomes aware, she will alter her behavior or warn her co-conspirators."

Zeph leaned over the page, reading. "You want me to tail a tile-maker through the Feast crowds without her noticing."

"I want *us* to conduct coordinated observation. You will move through the market as a normal patron. I will use elevated vantage points—rooftops, archways—to track her from above." Cornelius tapped the parchment. "We will establish a rotation. Maintain distance. Communicate via pre-arranged signals."

"Signals."

"Yes. If you spot her engaging in suspicious activity, you will... I do not know. Adjust your cap. Tie your shoe. Some innocuous gesture I can observe from a distance."

Zeph stared at him. "You've really thought about this."

"I have been thinking about little else since Theo took my key." Cornelius's claws drummed the desk. "I cannot reclaim the vault. I cannot compel the Watch to reopen the case. But I can observe. I can document. I can build a record that will eventually force action."

"Eventually."

"Justice does not happen instantly. It is a process. A careful accumulation of evidence." Cornelius gestured to his ledger. "I have the beginning here. Now I need the middle. The connections. The proof that turns suspicion into certainty."

Zeph was quiet for a moment. Then he said, "You really think Sophia did it? Personally?"

Cornelius considered the question.

"I think Sophia hired Elias to deliver the tool used to breach the vault. I think she knows who melted the seal and stole the correspondence. Whether she wielded the poison herself..." He paused. "That remains unclear. But she is complicit. And complicity is enough to start."

Zeph nodded. He pulled the blanket off the chair and draped it over his shoulders like a cape. "Okay. So when do we start?"

"Tomorrow. First light." Cornelius began rolling up the parchment. "The Doukas workshop opens early. We will position ourselves in the market before she leaves her home and maintain observation throughout the day."

"All day?"

"As long as necessary."

"What about the library?"

Cornelius stopped. His claws hovered over the parchment.

The library.

His sanctuary. His responsibility.

He had not opened the doors today. Had not allowed patrons in. The building had sat dark and silent while he brooded in the rafters and drafted case notes.

Could he abandon it again tomorrow?

Could he leave it unguarded while he pursued a thief through the Feast crowds?

His tail curled tight.

The library was his hoard. His purpose.

But what good was guarding an empty building when the crime that had violated it went unpunished?

"We will lock it," Cornelius said. His voice was firm. "Post a notice. 'Closed for Inventory.'"

"People are gonna talk."

"People are already talking. They believe the library is unsafe. Let them think I am conducting emergency inspections to restore security." Cornelius finished rolling the parchment and tucked it into his desk drawer. "One day. Two at most. Then we return, and I reopen with full safety certification."

Zeph adjusted the blanket-cape. "And if we don't find anything in two days?"

"Then we expand our search." Cornelius pulled out the full suspect list again. "We move to the next name. And the next. Until we find the thread that unravels the entire conspiracy."

"Or until the murderer finds us."

"That is also a possibility."

Zeph grinned. It was a nervous grin, but genuine. "You're kind of terrifying when you commit to something."

"I am a dragon." Cornelius adjusted his spectacles. "Terrifying is part of the contract."

Zeph laughed. The sound echoed in the dark library, bright and almost reckless.

Cornelius felt something shift in his chest again. That strange warmth he had experienced yesterday when Zeph had brought him mint. When the boy had said *our library*.

This was not just about reclaiming his sanctuary anymore.

It was about proving that truth mattered. That evidence mattered. That a dragon who ran a library could still be a dragon who *defended* it.

Even if he had to do so from the shadows.

Cornelius closed the ledger and moved toward the supply room. "Go home. Sleep. Bring practical clothes tomorrow—something that does not stand out in the market. And eat beforehand. We may be watching for hours."

"Yes, sir." Zeph gave a mock salute, then paused. "Hey, Cornelius?"

"Yes?"

"Thanks. For letting me help."

Cornelius looked at him. The boy was wrapped in a blanket, grinning like this was an adventure instead of a crime investigation. Sixteen years old and willing to chase a murderer through the Feast crowds because he believed his librarian boss was right.

Foolish.

Loyal.

Brave.

"You are welcome," Cornelius said quietly.

Zeph nodded and headed for the front door. He unlocked the iron bar, slipped out into the noise and chaos of the Feast, and pulled it shut behind him.

Cornelius stood alone in the dark library once more.

The amber light from the dome had faded to almost nothing. The shelves rose like walls around him. The chained vault door sat silent and accusing.

He could still feel the prickle at the base of his wings. The hoard-threat instinct that had warned him two days ago.

But it was different now.

Before, it had been a warning of danger approaching.

Now, it was a call to action.

Cornelius returned to his desk and retrieved the parchment with the suspect web. He studied it one more time, committing the names and connections to memory.

Sophia Doukas.

Sister Photine.

Alexandros Doukas.

Eudora of Naxos.

Petros Kallistos.

Mago Hanno.

Six threads.

One crime.

And a dragon with something to prove.

He folded the parchment carefully and placed it inside his private ledger. Then he locked the ledger in the desk drawer and pocketed the key.

Tomorrow, he would leave his sanctuary.

Tomorrow, he would step into the chaos of the Feast and hunt for a murderer among the tile-sellers and sailors and merchants.

Tomorrow, he would prove that a dragon who ran a library could also be a dragon who brought justice.

But tonight, he would prepare.

Cornelius moved through the dark library with fluid, silent grace. He checked the locks on every window. Reinforced the bar on the front door. Ensured the rear delivery entrance was sealed.

Then he climbed the spiral stairs to the archive level and retrieved a small leather satchel from the storage closet. Inside, he placed:

- A notebook and two pencils.
- His private incident log.
- The intake form Elias had signed.
- A vial of mint oil (for focus).
- A pouch of dried cricket (for sustenance).

He returned to the main floor and set the satchel beside his desk.

Outside, the Feast noise began to fade. The drums grew quieter. The laughter turned to murmurs. The city was settling into the late-night lull before dawn.

Cornelius stood in the center of his library and looked up at the amber dome.

The glass panels caught the faint glow of distant lanterns, scattering light across the shelves like scattered stars.

This was his hoard.

Not gold. Not gems.

Knowledge. Order. Silence.

And he would defend it.

Even if it meant becoming something more than a dragon who ran a library.

Even if it meant becoming a dragon who hunted thieves.

Cornelius folded his wings and extinguished the last lamp.

The library fell into complete darkness.

And in that darkness, he made his choice.

Tomorrow, they would begin.

Tomorrow, they would go to House Doukas.
