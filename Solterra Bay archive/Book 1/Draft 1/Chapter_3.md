# Chapter 3

Cornelius stood guard beside the vault door while Zeph ran to fetch the Watch.

He did not enter. Did not disturb the scene further. His claws itched to examine every surface, catalog every detail, but he forced himself to wait. The Watch needed to see this exactly as he had found it—melted seal, missing letters, dead courier, fool of a vault owner slumped in the archives with his incriminating schematic.

The evidence was clear. Organized. Irrefutable.

The Watch would have to listen.

Cornelius adjusted his spectacles and peered through the doorway at Elias's body. The burnt almond scent had faded slightly, dispersing into the library's cooler air, but the ozone still clung to the iron door frame. Someone with skill had done this. Someone who understood both magic and murder.

His tail lashed once, scoring the stone floor.

Someone had turned his library into a crime scene.

The front door banged open.

"Cornelius!" Zeph's voice echoed from the main hall, followed by heavier footsteps and the jangle of official equipment.

Cornelius descended from the vault platform and moved to intercept them at the base of the stairs.

Captain Theo Melas entered first, his leather armor dusty from the Feast crowds. He was a thick-shouldered human in his forties, graying at the temples, with the flat expression of a man who had seen too many stupid problems in one lifetime. Two guards flanked him—younger, nervous, gripping their truncheons like shields.

Theo stopped when he saw Cornelius. His gaze flicked to the vault door, then back. "Where's the body?"

"Inside the Kallistos vault. Elias of Tyre, deceased approximately three to five hours ago." Cornelius gestured with one wing. "The cause of death is inhaled poison. The vault has been breached and its contents stolen. The seal was melted with focused magical heat. I have secured the scene and documented the initial findings."

Theo stared at him. "You documented the findings."

"Yes. I am the Curator. This is my library."

"This is a crime scene under the jurisdiction of the city Watch." Theo moved past him toward the stairs. "You're a librarian. Stay out of the way."

Cornelius's scales prickled. "I am the individual who discovered the breach. I identified the poison residue and the method of entry. I located the secondary suspect in the archives with relevant schematics. My observations are material to—"

"Your observations are noted." Theo climbed the stairs without looking back. "We'll take it from here."

The two guards followed, their boots striking the stone with graceless thuds.

Cornelius stood frozen at the base of the stairs, fury building like heat in his chest.

*Stay out of the way.*

As though he were a bystander. As though his century of guarding this sanctuary meant nothing. As though the violation of his hoard, the desecration of his silence, the *murder on his floor* were merely an inconvenience to be processed and filed.

Zeph appeared at his side, breathing hard. "I ran all the way to the Watch station. Are they gonna—?"

"They are going to ignore everything I tell them and ruin my evidence." Cornelius stalked toward the stairs. "Come. You will observe and remember. If Theo will not listen now, we will ensure he has no choice later."

They climbed to the vault platform. Theo stood in the doorway, examining the melted seal with one hand on his belt. The two guards hovered behind him, trying very hard not to look at the body on the floor.

Cornelius stopped beside Theo and pointed to the pooled iron at the base of the door. "The heat required to melt this metal indicates sustained magical application. Not a burst. Not an accident. Someone stood here and methodically compromised the seal." He gestured to the soot marks near the door frame. "The residue pattern suggests the use of a focusing tool. Likely delivered in the package Elias brought yesterday."

Theo glanced at him. "What package?"

"The courier delivered a wrapped parcel for vault storage. I logged it in the intake ledger. It contained powdered lapis lazuli and machine oil residue. I suspected it was not the declared 'correspondence' and placed it in the secure transfer drawer." Cornelius turned toward the main desk. "The package is now missing. It was the tool used to breach the wards."

"Lapis and oil." Theo's tone was flat. "You're telling me someone smuggled in a magic lock pick made of paint powder and grease."

"I am telling you the chemical composition was inconsistent with the declared contents. The dust and oil are reagents used in high-temperature alchemical reactions. Combined with the correct binding agent, they produce—"

"Cornelius." Theo held up one hand. "I appreciate the lecture. But we're dealing with a death here. Not a chemistry experiment."

"The death is *connected* to the chemistry." Cornelius's claws dug into the stone. "The burnt almond scent near the victim's mouth indicates a cyanide-based compound. The ozone residue indicates powerful magic. The missing package, the melted seal, the stolen correspondence—they are all parts of a coordinated theft and murder."

Theo turned back to the vault. "Or Elias tried to rob the place, got in over his head, and something went wrong. People die doing stupid things during the Feast. It's not a conspiracy. It's bad luck and poor planning."

Cornelius stared at him. "You believe this was *accidental*?"

"I believe we need a proper examination before we start declaring murder." Theo gestured to one of the guards. "Get Sister Photine. Tell her we need a death certification."

The guard fled toward the exit with visible relief.

Theo stepped into the vault, crouching beside Elias's body. He did not touch it. Did not disturb the position of the limbs. At least he had *that* much sense.

"No wounds," Theo muttered. "No blood. Face is pale. Lips are... yeah, that's a little blue." He straightened. "Could be heart failure. Could be bad air in the vault."

"The vault is ventilated," Cornelius snapped. "And the scent is not 'bad air.' It is a specific chemical marker consistent with—"

"Consistent with your theory." Theo turned to face him fully. "Look. I know you care about this place. I know you're... protective. But you're not a Watch investigator. You're a dragon who runs a library. Let us do our job."

The words landed like stones.

Cornelius went very still. His wings folded tight against his back. His tail curled around his feet.

*You're a dragon who runs a library.*

Not a guardian. Not an expert. Not a witness with valuable forensic observations.

A dragon.

Who ran a library.

And therefore had no authority. No standing. No voice in the investigation of a crime *in his own domain*.

"Cornelius?" Zeph whispered.

He did not respond. Did not move. If he moved, he would do something unwise. He would say something that would make Theo dismiss him even further. He would lose what little cooperation remained.

So he stood. And he watched. And he committed every detail to memory so that when this fool of a captain filed his inadequate report, Cornelius would have his own record. Complete. Accurate. *Correct*.

Footsteps echoed from the main hall. Lighter this time. Measured.

Sister Photine appeared at the top of the stairs, her healer's satchel slung over one shoulder. She was human, middle-aged, with the brisk efficiency of someone who dealt with blood and bone as a matter of routine. Her gray robes were clean but worn. Her hands were scrubbed pink.

She stopped when she saw the vault, her gaze sweeping the melted seal, the body, and finally Cornelius.

"Captain," she said. "You called for a certification?"

"Yeah. We've got a dead courier in the Kallistos vault. No visible trauma. The Curator thinks it's poison. I want your professional opinion."

Photine set down her satchel and approached the body with calm, practiced steps. She knelt beside Elias, her robes pooling on the stone floor.

Cornelius watched her hands. Watched where she touched.

She pressed two fingers to Elias's throat, checking for a pulse that clearly wasn't there. Then she tilted his head, examining his eyes. She peeled back one eyelid. Checked the other.

"Pupils are dilated," she murmured. "Consistent with oxygen deprivation or neurological distress."

She moved to his mouth, prying it open with impersonal efficiency. Looked inside. Sniffed.

"There is a faint almond scent," she said. "But that could be from food. Some nuts produce similar oils."

Cornelius's claws scored the floor. "It is not *food*. It is—"

"Let her work," Theo said.

Photine ignored them both. She unbuttoned Elias's tunic and pressed her palm against his chest. Listened. Felt the ribs. Then she rolled up his sleeves and examined his forearms and hands.

Her fingers paused over the blisters on Elias's palms—the ones Cornelius had noted earlier.

"Rope burns," Photine said. "Fresh. He was climbing or hauling something heavy."

"Consistent with using the ventilation system," Cornelius said. He pointed toward the archives. "There is evidence of—"

"I'll get to that." Theo waved him off.

Photine turned Elias's hands over, examining the backs of his fingers. Then she checked his wrists. His neck. She pulled his collar aside and studied the skin below his jaw.

She was looking for something specific.

Cornelius tilted his head, watching. Her movements were methodical. Professional. But there was a precision to it that felt less like a general examination and more like confirmation.

She knew what she was looking for.

And she was checking to see if she found it.

Photine straightened, brushing her hands on her robes. "No visible splotches. No swelling. Skin tone is pale but not discolored beyond expected post-mortem settling."

She was narrating for Theo's benefit. Recording details.

But the specific mention of *splotches*—the careful examination of the skin for reactions—suggested she was ruling out a specific cause.

Or confirming its absence.

Cornelius stepped closer. "What kind of splotches?"

Photine glanced at him. "Some poisons cause subcutaneous hemorrhaging. Visible marks. This body does not show those signs."

"But other poisons do not," Cornelius said. "Cyanide compounds, for example, do not produce external marks. They cause rapid oxygen deprivation, dilated pupils, and the scent of burnt almonds—all of which are present."

"Cyanide is an exotic substance." Photine stood, collecting her satchel. "It requires specific knowledge and preparation. The more likely explanation is heart failure brought on by exertion and stress."

"He was *murdered*," Cornelius said. His voice cracked with frustration. "The evidence—"

"The evidence is circumstantial." Theo crossed his arms. "What's your ruling, Sister?"

Photine wiped her hands on a cloth from her satchel. As she turned, her robe shifted, and the hem of her sandal caught the amber light from the dome.

Cornelius saw it.

A thread. Blue. Bright against the worn leather.

The same shade as the mended hem on Sophia Doukas's dress.

His breath stopped.

The thread was fresh. Clean. Not frayed or faded. It had been placed recently—snagged, perhaps, in the last day or two.

In a place where blue tile-maker's thread might be found.

Like the Doukas workshop.

Or Sophia Doukas's home.

Cornelius's mind raced. Photine had been in contact with Sophia. Or somewhere Sophia had been. Recently enough that the thread remained intact.

He opened his mouth to speak.

"Natural causes," Photine said. She closed her satchel with a firm snap. "Heart failure, most likely stress-induced. I'll file the certification with the Healer's Hall this afternoon."

"Natural causes," Theo repeated. He looked at Cornelius. "See? No conspiracy. Just a man who pushed himself too hard."

"That is *incorrect*." Cornelius's wings flared. "The chemical signatures, the melted seal, the missing package and correspondence—none of that is explained by heart failure. This was a planned theft. Elias was killed to silence him. The evidence is—"

"The evidence is being reviewed by trained officials." Theo's voice hardened. "You've done your part, Cornelius. You found the body. You reported it. But this is Watch business now. You need to step back."

"This is *my library*." Cornelius's voice shook with suppressed fury. "The crime occurred in *my vault*. The victim delivered a suspicious package *to me*. I have documented every relevant detail, and you are ignoring all of it because you would rather close the case quickly than investigate properly."

Theo's jaw tightened. "Watch your tone."

"I will not. You are wrong. Sister Photine is wrong. And if you proceed with this ruling, you will allow a murderer to walk free while the city believes a man died of natural causes in a locked, warded vault that was breached with professional skill and magical tools." Cornelius stepped forward, claws scoring the stone. "I will not allow it."

"You don't have a choice." Theo gestured to the guards. "Seal the vault. No one goes in or out until we've cleared the body and logged the scene."

One of the guards produced a heavy iron chain and began threading it through the door handle.

"You cannot seal the vault," Cornelius said. "It is Kallistos property. I am the Curator. I hold the access key."

"Not anymore." Theo held out his hand. "Give me the key."

Cornelius stared at him. "No."

"Cornelius. Give me the key, or I will cite you for obstruction."

"You cannot cite me for refusing to surrender property I am legally bound to protect."

"The vault is a crime scene. That overrides your custodial rights." Theo's voice was flat. Final. "Key. Now."

They stood facing each other on the platform, the vault door between them like a wall. The guards watched, tense. Photine stood to one side, silent.

Zeph shifted nervously. "Cornelius..."

The boy was right. Cornelius knew he was right.

If he refused, Theo would have him removed. Possibly arrested. And then he would have *no* access to the investigation. No ability to observe, document, or correct the Watch's failures.

But if he surrendered the key, he lost his last claim to authority over his own domain.

His hoard had been violated. His sanctuary breached.

And now he was being forced to hand it over to a man who could not—or would not—see the truth.

Slowly, Cornelius reached into the small pouch at his side and withdrew the vault key. It was old iron, heavy, warm from resting against his scales.

He held it for one long moment.

Then he placed it in Theo's palm.

"Documented," he said quietly. "I am surrendering this key under protest. I formally object to the ruling of natural causes. I formally request a full investigation into the theft of Kallistos correspondence and the death of Elias of Tyre."

"Noted." Theo pocketed the key. "Now step back. We'll handle the rest."

Cornelius turned and descended the stairs.

Zeph followed, silent.

Behind them, the guards finished chaining the vault door. The iron links rattled. The lock clicked.

Cornelius reached the main floor and stopped beside his desk. His claws rested on the wood. His tail lay flat and still.

He had done everything correctly.

He had observed. Documented. Reported.

He had presented evidence. Made logical deductions. Followed procedure.

And he had been dismissed.

Ignored.

Locked out of his own vault.

"Cornelius?" Zeph's voice was small. Uncertain.

"Begin the afternoon opening procedures," Cornelius said. His voice was calm. Controlled. Empty. "The reading tables require inspection. The History section needs re-shelving."

"But—"

"We have work to do."

Zeph hesitated. Then he nodded and moved toward the storage room.

Cornelius stood alone in the center of the library.

Above him, the amber light from the dome filtered down through colored glass. The shelves stood silent and ordered. The books waited, patient and still.

Everything was in its place.

Except the murder was being buried. The thief was walking free. And the only people who seemed to care were a dragon with no legal standing and a sixteen-year-old intern with flour on his shoes.

Cornelius's claws dug into the wood of his desk.

He had been ready for a thief.

He had not been ready for the Watch to be more dangerous than the criminal.

But he was ready now.

He pulled out his private ledger and opened it to a new page.

*Spring Feast, Day Two,* he wrote. *Incident Log, Continued.*

*10:00 — Captain Theo Melas arrives. Dismisses forensic evidence. Declares death accidental.*

*10:20 — Sister Photine certifies "natural causes." Noted: Blue thread on sandal. Match to Sophia Doukas (Chapter 1). Photine examined body for specific skin reactions (splotches). Suggests prior knowledge of expected poison type.*

*10:30 — Vault sealed. Key confiscated. Access denied.*

*Conclusion: Official investigation is compromised or incompetent. Proceed independently.*

He set down his pen.

The Watch had the legal authority.

But Cornelius had the truth.

And he would prove it.

Even if he had to do it alone.
