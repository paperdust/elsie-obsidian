# Chapter 19

The library was a disaster.

Cornelius perched on the circulation desk—his injured wing folded as well as it could manage—and surveyed the damage with a mix of pride and dismay.

The waxed aisle gleamed in the lamplight. Slick. Treacherous. Marked with scuff marks and blood. One of the Index ladders lay tilted across the southern archive entrance like a fallen barricade. Reading tables were overturned. Papers scattered. The bronze Intake bin stood open, its lid thrown back to reveal the empty interior.

And in the center of it all, Captain Theo Melas directed his guards with clipped efficiency.

"Careful with that vial. Do not—I repeat, *do not*—drop it. Liquid fire is banned for a reason." Theo pointed toward a guard handling the glass container with exaggerated caution. "Get it to Sister Photine. She will know how to neutralize it safely."

The guard nodded. Carried the vial toward the main doors as if it were made of spun sugar.

Cornelius's tail coiled. The vial that had nearly destroyed his entire collection was leaving the building. Good.

His gaze shifted to Alexandros Doukas.

The man stood near the eastern wall. Manacles locked around his wrists. Two guards flanking him. Blood still streaked his neck and face from Cornelius's claws. His expensive coat was shredded.

But his expression remained cold. Empty.

As if being arrested for murder was merely an inconvenience.

Cornelius's scales prickled.

That emptiness was worse than rage. Rage could be understood. Predicted.

Emptiness suggested calculation. Control.

A man who had not yet accepted defeat.

Footsteps echoed from the main entrance.

Cornelius turned.

Sophia Doukas stepped through the broken doors.

She moved with the same composed grace Cornelius remembered from their confrontation at the Doukas estate. Dark hair pinned back. Blue dress—the one with the carefully mended hem—now slightly rumpled from hurried travel.

Her gaze swept the library. Took in the chaos. The guards. The overturned furniture.

Her brother in manacles.

She went very still.

"Alexandros?" Her voice was thin. Strained. "What—"

Theo intercepted her before she could cross the floor. Raised one hand. Professional. Firm.

"Sophia Doukas. I need you to remain where you are."

She stopped. Blinked at him. Confusion flickering across her face.

Or an excellent imitation of confusion.

Cornelius watched her carefully. He had documented her involvement. Had traced the blue thread from her hem to Sister Photine's sandal. Had heard her argument with Elias about wards and sequences.

But had she known about the murder?

That remained unclear.

Behind Sophia, another figure entered.

Captain Mago Hanno.

The orc smuggler filled the doorway. Broad shoulders. Scarred hands. An expression that suggested he would rather be anywhere else.

Theo's eyebrows rose.

"Captain Hanno. This is unexpected."

Mago's gaze found Cornelius. Held for a moment. Something that might have been respect flickered in those dark eyes.

"Got word you were hauling in Alexandros Doukas for murder." Mago's voice was a low rumble. "Figured I should be here. Since my name keeps coming up in this mess."

"You are not under arrest," Theo said carefully.

"Good." Mago crossed massive arms. "I would like to keep it that way. So I am here to make sure everyone understands my role. Which was minimal."

Cornelius's tail twitched.

The smuggler was covering his exposure. Smart.

And his presence meant all the major players were now in one room.

Theo turned toward Cornelius. His expression shifted. Recognition. Resignation.

"Curator Drake. I believe you have... documentation regarding tonight's events?"

It was phrased as a question.

But the weight behind it was clear.

Explain. Now.

Cornelius straightened. Ignored the ache in his wing. The exhaustion pulling at his scales.

This was his moment.

The reveal.

The careful unraveling of threads that proved motive, method, and murderer.

He had spent weeks chasing this truth. Had made mistakes. Had publicly accused the wrong person. Had been choked in an alley and threatened with fire.

But he had been right about the core crime.

And now he would prove it.

"Yes," Cornelius said. His voice was steady. Clear. The tone he used when delivering particularly complex cataloging lectures. "I have documentation. And an explanation."

He gestured with one claw toward the oilcloth bundle that sat carefully preserved on a nearby table. Guarded by two watchmen.

"It begins with those letters."

Every gaze in the room shifted to the bundle.

Forty years of Kallistos correspondence. Tied with ribbon gone brittle with age.

"Those are family documents," Sophia said. Her voice was too quick. Too sharp. "Private property. You have no right—"

"They are stolen property," Cornelius corrected. "Removed from the Kallistos family vault during an illegal breach six days ago. The same breach that resulted in the death of Elias of Tyre."

Theo nodded. Gestured for Cornelius to continue.

Cornelius's claws tapped against the circulation desk. A thinking rhythm.

"The crime began with a simple commission. Sophia Doukas hired Elias of Tyre to steal these letters from the Kallistos vault." He looked directly at Sophia. "You wanted leverage. House Kallistos has dominated the luxury tile market for generations. But their grip relies on reputation. Respectability."

Sophia's face went pale.

"These letters contain evidence of a long-running affair between the Kallistos patriarch and his mistress," Cornelius continued. "Scandalous. Damaging. Worth a fortune to the right buyer. Or invaluable as blackmail material against the family directly."

"I never—" Sophia started.

"You argued with Elias in the market square," Cornelius said. His voice was calm. Factual. "Four days before his death. You discussed wards. A sequence. You withheld payment until the task was completed. I witnessed this myself."

Sophia's mouth snapped shut.

Theo was watching her now. Evaluating.

"But the commission was complicated," Cornelius said. "Elias needed help. The Kallistos vault is protected by ancient wards. By a physical seal of enchanted iron. He could not breach it alone."

His gaze shifted to Alexandros.

"Your brother possesses the necessary skills. Access to alchemical compounds through the Doukas tile workshop. Expertise in high-heat kilns. Knowledge of magical catalysts."

Alexandros's expression did not change.

"Elias recruited Alexandros to melt the vault seal," Cornelius continued. "Using a concentrated kiln accelerant—the same compound that fires your tiles at extreme temperatures—combined with a magical catalyst to superheat the iron."

Theo leaned forward slightly. Interested.

"The method worked," Cornelius said. "The seal melted. The vault opened. But there was a complication."

He paused. Let the silence stretch.

"Elias got greedy."

Sophia's breath caught.

"Elias was already in debt to Captain Mago Hanno," Cornelius said. He nodded toward the orc. "Gambling debts. Significant enough that Mago was considering... aggressive collection methods."

Mago grunted. Did not deny it.

"Elias promised to repay the debt with profits from a big score. What he called 'Kallistos gold.'" Cornelius's tail coiled. "But he lied to everyone involved. To Mago, he claimed he was stealing literal gold. To Sophia, he claimed he was stealing glaze formulas. To his actual client—Eudora of Naxos—he claimed he was stealing tile recipes for industrial espionage."

Theo's eyes widened slightly.

"Multiple clients," he said slowly. "Multiple lies."

"Exactly." Cornelius's wings rustled. "Elias intended to take payment from Eudora—fifty silver crescents hidden in a correspondence folder delivered to the vault. Then steal the *actual* valuable contents—these letters—and sell them separately. Likely through Mago's network."

He looked at Sophia.

"You would never receive what you paid for. Alexandros would be implicated in a vault breach for nothing. And Elias would walk away with everyone's money."

Sophia's hands trembled.

"I did not know," she whispered. "I swear I did not know he was planning—"

"You did not know about the double-cross," Cornelius agreed. "But you knew about the theft. You commissioned it."

Theo made a note.

Cornelius turned his full attention to Alexandros.

"Your brother discovered Elias's betrayal. Perhaps Elias bragged to the wrong person. Perhaps Alexandros noticed inconsistencies in the plan. Regardless—" Cornelius's voice hardened. "—Alexandros decided to solve the problem permanently."

Alexandros's mouth curved. Not quite a smile.

"Go on, Curator," he said. His voice was silk over steel. "Tell them how you think I did it."

Cornelius's claws flexed.

"You melted the vault seal as planned. But the accelerant produces toxic fumes when burned in a confined space. Burnt almond scent. Ozone residue. I documented both at the crime scene."

He gestured toward his incident ledger. Still sitting on the desk beside him.

"Initial analysis suggested cyanide poisoning. But Sister Photine certified natural causes. Heart failure induced by stress." Cornelius's tail lashed once. "She was partially correct. Elias did die from respiratory collapse. But not from a classic poison."

Theo was rivianeted now. Listening with complete focus.

"He died from inhaling concentrated kiln-accelerant fumes in the poorly ventilated vault." Cornelius's voice was steady. Clinical. "The same fumes that melted the iron seal. High heat. Magical catalyst. In a small stone room with no air circulation."

He looked directly at Alexandros.

"You knew the fumes would be lethal. You melted the seal while Elias was inside the vault. Closed the door. Let the fumes do their work."

Sophia made a choked sound.

Alexandros's expression remained calm.

"Clever," he said. "But can you prove intent? Perhaps it was an accident. A miscalculation."

"Your behavior afterward proves intent," Cornelius said. "You stole the correspondence. Hid it inside the library's Intake Chute—the only location where the vault's inventory wards would not trigger an alarm. You planned to retrieve it later, after the initial investigation concluded."

His wing ached. He ignored it.

"But you made mistakes. You left trace evidence. The same chemical signature on your hands. The same burnt-almond scent that clung to your clothes when you assaulted me in the alley."

Theo's gaze snapped to Alexandros.

"You assaulted the Curator?"

"He grabbed my throat," Cornelius said. His voice was flat. Matter-of-fact. "Threatened to stage an accident. To silence my investigation."

Theo's expression darkened.

"And tonight," Cornelius continued, "you returned to recover the letters. Used the same alchemical fire to melt the service entrance lock. Retrieved the correspondence from the Intake bin. Attempted to burn the entire library when escape became impossible."

He gestured toward where the vial had sat.

"Liquid fire. Banned by Council decree. Carried into a civic building during Spring Feast."

The room went very quiet.

Sophia was staring at her brother now. Horror and disbelief warring across her face.

"Alexandros," she whispered. "Tell me it is not true. Tell me you did not—"

"I cleaned up a mess." Alexandros's voice was ice. No emotion. No regret. "Elias was a liability. Greedy. Stupid. He would have exposed all of us."

Sophia's face crumpled.

"You killed him."

"I solved a problem." Alexandros's gaze was steady. Cold. "Which I would not have needed to do if you had controlled your hired help better."

Theo moved.

Fast. Deliberate.

He crossed the space between himself and Alexandros in three strides.

"Alexandros Doukas. You are under arrest for the murder of Elias of Tyre. For theft of Kallistos family property. For assault on Curator Cornelius Drake. For illegal possession and deployment of banned alchemical weapons. And for attempted arson of a civic building during Spring Feast."

He nodded to the guards.

"Take him to the holding cells. Separate from general population."

The guards moved. Gripped Alexandros's arms.

Began to pull him toward the doors.

Alexandros did not resist.

But as he passed Cornelius, he stopped.

Met the dragon's gaze.

"You should have let it burn," he said quietly. "The library. The letters. All of it. Would have been simpler."

Cornelius's wings flared.

"Nothing about truth is simple," he said. "But it is necessary."

Alexandros's mouth twitched.

Then the guards pulled him away.

Out through the broken doors.

Into the night.

Gone.

Silence settled over the library.

Sophia stood frozen. Pale. Shaking.

Theo turned to her.

"Sophia Doukas. You commissioned theft of private property. Conspiracy to commit industrial espionage. I am placing you under arrest pending formal charges."

She did not fight. Did not argue.

Just nodded.

Numb.

A guard moved forward. No manacles this time. Just a firm hand on her elbow. Guiding her toward the exit.

She paused as she passed Cornelius.

"I did not want anyone to die," she whispered. "I just wanted—"

"To win," Cornelius said. Not unkindly. Simply factual. "To level the market. To hurt a rival family."

Her eyes filled with tears.

"Yes."

"Then you should have chosen a better method." Cornelius's tail coiled. "And a better partner."

She flinched.

Then the guard led her away.

Theo watched them go. Then turned to Mago.

"Captain Hanno. Your role?"

Mago shrugged.

"Elias owed me money. Promised to pay it back with proceeds from a job. He died before paying. I wrote off the debt." The orc's voice was flat. Practical. "That is all."

"You did not commission the theft?"

"No."

"Did not hire Elias to steal from the Kallistos vault?"

"No."

"Did not provide tools, access, or assistance?"

"No." Mago's gaze was steady. "I loan money. I collect debts. I do not murder people over silver when I can simply take their ship as collateral."

Theo studied him for a long moment.

Then nodded.

"You are free to go. But I will have questions. Formal statements. Documentation of Elias's debt."

"You will have them." Mago turned toward the doors. Paused. Looked back at Cornelius. "You are a persistent little dragon."

Cornelius inclined his head.

"I am a Curator. Persistence is required."

Something that might have been respect flickered across Mago's scarred face.

Then he was gone too.

Leaving only Cornelius, Theo, Zeph, and the scattered guards processing evidence.

Theo approached the circulation desk.

Looked up at where Cornelius perched. Injured wing. Blood on his claws. Scales disheveled.

"You broke into a sealed crime scene," Theo said.

"I exploited an architectural vulnerability to protect evidence from destruction," Cornelius corrected.

Theo's mouth twitched.

Almost a smile.

"You conducted an unauthorized investigation."

"I documented observations in my personal incident log."

"You set traps inside a civic building."

"I utilized available resources to contain a dangerous suspect."

"You fought a man twice your size."

"I defended my hoard."

Theo laughed.

Actually laughed.

It was a rough sound. Exhausted. But genuine.

"You are *impossible*," he said.

"I am thorough," Cornelius replied.

Theo shook his head. But his expression had softened.

"The Council is going to have questions. About procedures. About jurisdiction. About a dragon Curator taking over a murder investigation."

"I have documentation." Cornelius gestured toward the ledger. "Complete timeline. Chain of evidence. Forensic analysis. Everything required for formal prosecution."

Theo picked up the ledger. Flipped through pages. His eyebrows rose.

"This is... extraordinarily detailed."

"I am a librarian. Detail is my profession."

Theo closed the ledger carefully.

"This will be the backbone of the case. Without it—" He paused. Met Cornelius's gaze. "—we would have nothing. Alexandros would walk. Sophia would deny involvement. Elias's death would remain classified as natural causes."

Cornelius's scales settled.

Validation.

Official. Public.

It felt... good.

"The Watch appreciates your assistance," Theo said formally. Then, quieter: "I appreciate it. You were right. About the murder. About the cover-up. About all of it."

He extended a hand.

Cornelius looked at it. The human gesture of respect. Partnership.

He lifted one claw. Placed it carefully in Theo's palm.

They shook.

"If you ever want to consult on future cases," Theo said, "the Watch would be interested in your... unique perspective."

Cornelius's wings rustled.

"I am a Curator. Not a detective."

"You are a dragon who runs a library," Theo said. That same phrase from before. But the tone was different now. Warm. Almost affectionate. "Which apparently makes you the best investigator I have worked with."

Cornelius felt something warm unfurl in his chest.

Pride. Recognition.

Belonging.

"I will consider your offer," he said carefully. "If the cases do not interfere with my primary duties."

"Fair enough." Theo released his claw. Stepped back. "For now—get that wing looked at. And try not to break into any more sealed buildings."

"I make no promises."

Theo laughed again. Turned toward his guards.

"Finish evidence collection. I want this room photographed and documented before we close the scene."

The guards moved to comply.

Theo paused at the main doors. Looked back.

"Thank you, Cornelius. For not giving up. For proving me wrong."

Then he was gone.

Leaving Cornelius alone on the circulation desk.

In his library.

His hoard.

Still a disaster. Still coated in wax and blood and the residue of violence.

But safe.

Protected.

Whole.

Beside him, Zeph climbed up onto the desk. Sat cross-legged. Shoulder almost touching Cornelius's wing.

"We did it," the boy said. His voice was soft. Amazed.

"Yes," Cornelius agreed. "We did."

"Are you going to take Theo's offer? Become a consulting detective?"

Cornelius considered this.

The idea of more cases. More investigations. More chaos disrupting his careful order.

But also—more truth uncovered. More justice served. More protection for the vulnerable.

"Perhaps," he said slowly. "Occasionally."

Zeph grinned.

"I think that means yes."

Cornelius's tail coiled around the boy's ankle. Gentle. Affectionate.

"It means we will discuss it. After the library is restored. After my wing heals. After—" He looked at the waxed floor. "—after we clean this entire disaster and return everything to proper order."

"So never," Zeph said. Still grinning.

"Eventually," Cornelius corrected.

They sat in comfortable silence.

The guards worked around them. Careful. Respectful of the space.

Outside, the Spring Feast continued. Distant music. Laughter. The city celebrating.

Inside the library, order slowly returned.

Piece by piece.

Book by book.

Exactly as it should be.

And Cornelius—small dragon, meticulous Curator, accidental detective—felt his scales finally settle.

The case was closed.

Justice was served.

His hoard was safe.

Everything else could wait until morning.
