# Chapter 8

The library steps felt wrong beneath Cornelius's claws.

Not the steps themselves. Those were the same sun-bleached limestone they had always been, worn smooth by centuries of feet. Solid. Familiar. *His*.

What felt wrong was standing on them looking *up* at locked doors instead of standing inside looking out.

"Maybe they just closed early for the Feast," Zeph said. He was squinting at the main entrance, hands shoved in his pockets. "You know. Because nobody's been coming in anyway."

"The library does not close early." Cornelius climbed another step, his tail lashing behind him. "I am the Curator. I decide the hours. And I did not authorize closure."

"Then why's the door barred?"

That was the question, was it not?

Heavy iron bars had been fitted across both main doors—the same storm-season bars normally stored in the basement. Someone had retrieved them, hauled them up three flights of stairs, and installed them across the entrance with the kind of thoroughness that suggested they were not meant to be removed quickly.

Cornelius's wings flared.

"This is unacceptable," he said. His voice was clipped. Controlled. Absolutely *furious*. "Someone has sealed my library without authorization. Without notification. Without—"

"Uh, Cornelius?"

"—without the slightest regard for procedure or—"

"Cornelius."

"*What?*"

Zeph pointed.

A figure was walking across the plaza toward them. Tall. Broad-shouldered. Wearing the dark blue tunic of the city Watch.

Captain Theo Melas.

Cornelius's claws scored the limestone.

Theo climbed the steps with the expression of a man who had already decided this conversation would be unpleasant and was determined to get through it as efficiently as possible. He stopped two steps below Cornelius and Zeph, pulled a rolled parchment from his belt, and held it out.

"Curator Drake. I need you to review this."

Cornelius did not take the parchment. "What is it?"

"Official notice. By order of the Council, the Solterra Bay Library is closed to all access pending completion of the Watch investigation into the death of Elias of Tyre and the related theft from the Kallistos vault. This includes custodial staff, family representatives, and—" Theo glanced at the parchment, "—the Curator."

The world narrowed.

Cornelius heard the words. Understood them individually. But strung together, they made no sense.

"Closed," he repeated.

"That's correct."

"My library."

"The city's library," Theo corrected. "Maintained under civic charter. Which means the Council has authority to restrict access during an active criminal investigation."

"You *closed* your investigation. You certified the death as natural causes. You sealed the vault and confiscated the key." Cornelius's voice rose slightly despite his best efforts to control it. "There *is* no active investigation."

"There's an incomplete investigation," Theo said. "I reopened the case this morning after receiving new testimony suggesting the death may not have been accidental."

Cornelius's wings snapped open. "I *told* you it was not accidental. Two days ago. In explicit detail."

"You gave me a theory. Now I have corroboration from a second source. Which means I need to conduct a proper investigation. Which means I need the building secured and undisturbed until my people can complete a full survey of the scene."

"I have not disturbed anything."

"You've been conducting your own investigation. Interviewing witnesses. Visiting suspects." Theo's expression was flat. Professional. "You went to the Doukas estate yesterday. You boarded Captain Mago Hanno's ship this morning. You've been asking questions all over the city about a case I explicitly told you to stay out of."

Cornelius's tail coiled. "I am gathering information relevant to a crime that occurred in my library. That is not interference. That is diligence."

"That's obstruction. And it stops now." Theo held out the parchment again. "You're banned from the library until the investigation is complete. No access. No exceptions. If you attempt to enter the building, you'll be arrested for tampering with a crime scene."

"You cannot do this."

"I can. I am." Theo's voice gentled slightly. "Look, I know you're upset. But you need to step back and let the Watch handle this. That's what we're trained for."

"You are trained to accept convenient explanations and close cases before the Feast crowds get nervous." Cornelius's claws dug into the stone. "I am trained to *observe*. To *document*. To find truth in details you dismiss as irrelevant."

"And I appreciate that. I do. But this is a murder investigation now. Not a library inventory project." Theo gestured at the barred doors. "You've done your part. You reported the crime. You preserved the scene. Now let me do mine."

"How long?"

"What?"

"How long will the library remain closed?"

Theo hesitated. "Until the end of the Feast. Maybe a few days after. Depends on what we find."

"A *week*."

"Could be less—"

"You are banning me from my own sanctuary for a week. During the largest trade event of the year. When the Council will be watching to see if the library is a *safe* place to store valuable materials." Cornelius's voice shook. "You are destroying the institution's reputation to protect your investigation. An investigation you would not even be conducting if I had not forced you to reopen it."

"I'm doing my job."

"You are doing the *minimum*." Cornelius stepped forward. He was small—barely the size of a large cat—but he put every ounce of draconic fury into his posture. "You certified a poisoning as natural causes. You dismissed evidence. You confiscated my vault key and sealed a crime scene without conducting a proper investigation. And now, when I have spent two days doing the work *you* should have done from the beginning, you ban me from my own library and claim authority you have not earned."

Theo's jaw tightened. "You want to file a complaint, you can take it up with the Council. But right now, you need to step away from the building. This is not a negotiation."

Cornelius stared at him.

At the parchment in his hand. The iron bars across the doors. The flat, bureaucratic certainty in Theo's eyes.

The Watch was not here to solve the crime.

They were here to *contain* it.

"Fine," Cornelius said. His voice was ice. "I will step away. But understand this, Captain: when your investigation fails—and it *will* fail—I will ensure the Council knows exactly why."

He turned and descended the steps with as much dignity as a small, furious dragon could muster.

Zeph followed, glancing back at Theo with an unreadable expression.

They did not speak until they had crossed the plaza and turned down a side street, out of sight of the library and the Watch guard Theo had left posted at the doors.

Only then did Cornelius stop walking.

He stood in the middle of the narrow street, wings folded tight, tail coiled, every line of his body radiating controlled fury.

"Breathe," Zeph said quietly.

"I am breathing."

"You're vibrating."

Cornelius exhaled slowly. The boy was correct. His scales were trembling with the effort of not screaming.

"He barred my library," Cornelius said. His voice was very quiet. Very controlled. "He sealed the doors. Posted a guard. Banned me from my own sanctuary."

"Yeah."

"I cannot access my records. My ledgers. My incident log. The correspondence catalogs that would prove Elias was planning to steal Kallistos documents." Cornelius's claws flexed. "Everything I need to build a case is inside that building. And Theo has locked me out."

"So what do we do?"

"I do not know."

It was the first time Cornelius had admitted that aloud.

The first time he had acknowledged that the institutional power he had always relied on—the authority of the library, the sanctity of his role—meant *nothing* when the Watch decided to exercise their legal prerogative.

He was a dragon who ran a library.

And Theo had just made it very clear that "running a library" did not grant him the power to investigate a murder.

Zeph was quiet for a moment. Then he said, "What if we went in anyway?"

Cornelius looked at him. "The building is barred. There is a guard at the door."

"At the *front* door. Yeah." Zeph shifted his weight. "But there are other ways in."

"The rear entrance is certainly also secured—"

"I'm not talking about doors."

Cornelius's tail uncurled slightly. "What are you talking about?"

Zeph reached into his pocket and pulled out a folded piece of parchment. It was creased and slightly torn, the ink smudged in places from being handled too many times.

Cornelius recognized it immediately.

The schematic.

The ventilation map they had found in Petros Kallistos's lap the morning of the murder.

"Why do you still have that?" Cornelius asked.

"Because I've been looking at it." Zeph unfolded the parchment carefully. "You said it was proof Petros knew how to get into the vault. That he gave the map to whoever broke in."

"Yes."

"But I don't think it's a map. I think it's a schedule."

Cornelius tilted his head. "Explain."

Zeph pointed to the notations along the margins. "See these? They're not routes. They're dates. Maintenance cycles. 'South archive grate cleaned third Sixthday of spring.' 'Upper reading room vent checked first Secondday of summer.' It's a log. Someone's been tracking when the vents get serviced."

Cornelius stared at the parchment.

He had seen those notations. Had dismissed them as irrelevant detail. His focus had been on the *layout*—the branching network of shafts and grates that connected every room in the library.

But Zeph was right.

This was not a thief's map.

This was a *maintenance schedule*.

Which meant—

"Petros was not planning the theft," Cornelius said slowly. "He was tracking when the vents would be accessible. When they would be *open*."

"Yeah. And look." Zeph pointed to a specific notation near the vault chamber. "South vault vent. Last serviced two weeks ago. Next service scheduled for end of summer."

"Two weeks ago." Cornelius's mind raced. "Before Elias delivered the package. Before the theft."

"So someone knew the vent would be clean. No dust to disturb. No cobwebs. Easy access if you knew where to climb." Zeph folded the parchment. "And if Petros had this schedule, he could've told whoever he was working with exactly when and where to enter the building without being seen."

Cornelius's wings flared.

It fit.

The drunken confession about discussing the vault with a stranger at a tavern. The schematic found in his possession. The ventilation grate removed in the south archive.

Petros had not been a grieving vault owner.

He had been an *informant*.

Providing the technical details necessary to bypass the library's physical security.

And now that same ventilation system—the system Cornelius had dismissed as peripheral infrastructure—was sitting in front of him. Documented. Mapped. *Open*.

"You are suggesting we break into the library," Cornelius said.

"I'm suggesting we use the route the thief used. The vents." Zeph tapped the parchment. "If we can get into the south archive, we can access the main floor. Get the records we need. Get out before the Watch even knows we were there."

"That is illegal."

"Yeah."

"Theo explicitly banned me from the building."

"I know."

"If we are caught, we will be arrested. You could lose your Academy placement. I could lose my position as Curator."

"I know," Zeph said again. He met Cornelius's gaze. "But if we don't do this, Theo's gonna spend a week poking around the library, not find anything useful, and close the case again. And whoever killed Elias gets away with it."

Cornelius stared at the boy.

At the folded parchment in his hands. The nervous determination in his eyes. The way he stood—weight forward, shoulders set—like someone who had already decided and was just waiting for permission.

When had Zeph become this?

Not the careless intern who brought pastries into the reading room.

Not the boy who needed to be told which shelves to dust.

This was someone who saw a problem and proposed a *felony* as the logical solution.

And the worst part was, Cornelius could not find a flaw in the reasoning.

He needed the library records. The correspondence logs. The intake forms. The private ledger locked in his desk.

All of it was inside the building.

And the only way to retrieve it was to commit a crime.

Against his own sanctuary.

Cornelius's claws flexed.

"The south archive grate," he said. "The one removed during the theft. Is it replaced?"

"I checked when we found Petros. It was loose. Just sitting in the frame. Anyone could lift it out."

"And the route from the grate to the main floor?"

Zeph studied the schematic. "Looks like a straight shot through the lower vent shaft. Comes out behind the circulation desk."

"That vent is narrow. I can fit. You cannot."

"I don't need to fit all the way through. I just need to get into the archive and hand you what you need from the other side."

"And if the Watch is patrolling inside the building?"

"Then we wait until they're not. Theo's got, what, six guards? Maybe eight? They can't watch every room all night." Zeph's voice was steady. Certain. "We go in after dark. Stay quiet. Get what we need. Get out."

Cornelius closed his eyes.

This was madness.

This was *necessary* madness.

"We would need tools. A pry bar for the grate. A light source. A way to signal if one of us is discovered."

"I can get tools. My cousin's got a toolbox at the fish stall."

"And if we are caught?"

"Then we tell the truth. That we needed records from your own library to solve a murder Theo's not even trying to solve." Zeph's jaw set. "It's not like we're robbing the place. We're just... retrieving evidence."

"That is not how the law works."

"Yeah, well, the law just locked you out of your own home. So maybe the law can stuff it."

Cornelius's wings twitched.

The boy had a point.

A deeply, fundamentally illegal point.

But a point nonetheless.

He opened his eyes and looked at the library rising above the rooftops in the distance. The amber dome catching the late afternoon light. The stone walls that had stood for three hundred years.

His sanctuary.

His hoard.

Now barred to him by bureaucracy and institutional cowardice.

Theo thought sealing the building would force Cornelius to step aside.

To accept his place as a mere custodian. A dragon who ran a library and nothing more.

But Theo had made a critical miscalculation.

Cornelius was not just the Curator.

He was the *guardian*.

And guardians did not ask permission to defend their hoard.

"Tonight," Cornelius said. His voice was quiet. Firm. "We will need darkness and silence. The second watch rotation ends at midnight. The guard will be tired. Inattentive."

Zeph's eyes widened. "You're serious."

"I am always serious." Cornelius adjusted his spectacles. "You will acquire the tools. I will plan the route. We will meet at the south wall of the library one hour after midnight. Wear dark clothing. Bring nothing that makes noise."

"Okay. Yeah. I can do that."

"And Zeph?"

"Yeah?"

Cornelius met his gaze. "If we are discovered, you will claim I coerced you. That I threatened your Academy placement. That you were following my orders under duress."

"I'm not gonna—"

"You *will*." Cornelius's voice was iron. "I am the Curator. I have tenure and Guild protection. You are a sixteen-year-old intern. If this fails, I can survive the professional consequences. You cannot. Do you understand?"

Zeph swallowed. "Yeah. I understand."

"Good." Cornelius turned and began walking toward the lower district. "Go home. Eat. Rest. Gather what we need. And do not speak of this to anyone. Not your cousin. Not your friends. No one."

"Where are you going?"

"To my quarters. To prepare." Cornelius glanced back. "Tonight, we commit a felony. I intend to ensure we commit it *competently*."

Zeph nodded, a small, nervous smile tugging at the corner of his mouth.

Then he turned and jogged toward the market district, disappearing into the Feast crowds.

Cornelius stood alone in the narrow street, the noise of the city buzzing around him like static.

He looked at the library one more time.

At the iron bars. The posted guard. The locked doors.

Theo had made this necessary.

The Council had made this inevitable.

And Cornelius would be damned if he let institutional incompetence destroy everything he had built.

He folded his wings tight and walked toward his small rented room above the bookbinder's shop.

There was work to do.

Plans to make.

Evidence to retrieve.

And a murderer to catch.

Even if he had to become a criminal to do it.
