# Chapter 2

Cornelius arrived at the library at dawn, as he did every morning. The key turned in the lock with its familiar click. The door swung open on hinges he had oiled himself three weeks prior. The mosaic floor gleamed in the amber light filtering through the dome.

Everything was exactly as it should be.

Except for the smell.

Cornelius stopped on the threshold, nostrils flaring. The vanilla-and-dust scent of his domain had been corrupted. Something acrid cut through it—sharp, metallic, wrong. He recognized it immediately: ozone. The residue magic left in the air when it was used for something larger than mending a hinge or cooling a room.

His scales prickled.

He stepped inside and closed the door behind him with deliberate care. The library was silent. No patrons yet. Zeph would not arrive for another hour. The stillness should have been comforting.

It was not.

Cornelius moved across the floor, claws clicking softly on stone. His eyes swept the main room. The shelves stood undisturbed. The reading tables were clean. The intake ledger sat exactly where he had left it.

The smell grew stronger as he approached the western wall.

The Kallistos vault.

The iron door—heavy, ancient, marked with the spiral seal of House Kallistos—was closed. But the seal itself...

Cornelius stopped three feet away and stared.

The metal around the lock had melted. Not rusted. Not corroded. *Melted*. The iron had run like candle wax, pooling at the base of the door in a solidified puddle. The spiral emblem, once crisp and proud, sagged like a wound.

Someone had breached his library.

The thought arrived cold and sharp, cutting through his shock. His wings snapped open reflexively, an instinctive threat display. The air around him felt too thin. His vision narrowed to the ruined seal, the desecration of his sanctuary.

He forced himself to breathe. Forced his wings to fold. Forced his mind to *work*.

Evidence. He needed evidence.

Cornelius approached the door and extended one claw, stopping just short of touching the melted iron. Heat radiated from it—faint, but present. The breach was recent. Within the last few hours.

He tasted the air again. Ozone, yes. But underneath it... something else. Sweet and bitter at once, like almonds left too long in the sun.

Burnt almond.

Cornelius knew that smell. He had read about it in his collection of alchemical texts, in the treatises on poisons and their applications. Cyanide compounds produced that scent when they reacted with living tissue.

Someone had not only breached the vault.

Someone had died doing it.

He pushed the door. It swung open with a groan of tortured metal.

The vault was small—ten feet by ten, lined with stone shelves. Petros Kallistos stored his family's private documents here: contracts, deeds, letters written in hands long dead. All of it catalogued, logged, and protected by wards that had stood for two centuries.

The wards had failed.

Or been bypassed.

Cornelius stepped inside, his gaze sweeping the shelves. Most of the contents remained untouched. Scrolls sat rolled and tied. Leather portfolios leaned against the wall. But the shelf directly across from the door—the one marked for correspondence—was empty.

The letters were gone.

And on the floor, sprawled in a heap of limbs and cheap wool, was Elias of Tyre.

The courier lay on his back, eyes open and glassy. His mouth hung slack. His hands were curled against his chest, fingers stiff. There were no visible wounds. No blood. No signs of struggle.

Just a dead man who smelled like burnt almonds and ozone.

Cornelius stood very still.

He had seen death before. Mice in the archives. A bird that had flown into the dome and broken its neck. Once, a very old patron who had passed quietly in a reading chair, a book open on his lap.

But this was different.

This was *murder* in his library.

The violation of it settled over him like a weight. Someone had entered his sanctuary—his hoard—and stolen from it. Killed in it. Left a body on *his floor* as though the library were some back-alley market stall.

Unacceptable.

Cornelius stepped closer to the body, forcing himself to observe. Elias's tunic was the same one he had worn yesterday. The blue spiral of the courier's guild was still visible on the shoulder. His boots were scuffed. His fingernails were clean, but his palms showed fresh blisters—the kind that came from climbing or handling rough rope.

Cornelius leaned down and sniffed. The burnt almond scent was strongest near the mouth and nose. Inhaled, then. Not ingested. A poison delivered through vapor or dust.

He turned his attention to the floor. No footprints in the dust—he kept the vault meticulously clean—but there were scuff marks near the door. Someone else had been here. Someone heavier than Elias, judging by the depth of the disturbed dust.

A partner. Or the killer.

Or both.

The sound of the library's front door opening jolted him from his analysis.

"Cornelius? You here?" Zeph's voice echoed from the main room, casual and loud.

Cornelius stepped out of the vault and closed the door behind him. "Do not shout in the library."

"Sorry." Zeph appeared at the base of the stairs, already pulling off his jacket. He stopped when he saw Cornelius's expression. "Whoa. You okay? You look—"

"We have a situation." Cornelius descended from the vault platform, moving with precise, controlled steps. "You will remain calm. You will not touch anything. You will do exactly as I instruct."

Zeph's eyes widened. "What happened?"

"The Kallistos vault has been breached. Contents have been stolen. There is a body."

The boy went pale. "A *body*?"

"Elias of Tyre. The courier from yesterday." Cornelius reached the main floor and turned to face Zeph fully. "He is deceased. I believe he was poisoned during the course of the theft."

"Oh my—" Zeph pressed a hand over his mouth. "We have to get the Watch. We have to—"

"We will. But first, I need you to check the perimeter. I want to know if anyone is still in the building."

"You think the killer's *here*?"

"I think it is a possibility we must exclude." Cornelius pointed toward the eastern wing. "Check the reading rooms and the archives. Do not enter any closed spaces alone. If you see anything unusual, you will return to me immediately. Do you understand?"

Zeph nodded, his face still bloodless, but his jaw set. "Yeah. I got it."

"Good." Cornelius watched him go, then turned back to the vault.

He needed to examine the scene more thoroughly before the Watch arrived and trampled over everything with their boots and their assumptions. Captain Melas was competent, but he did not have Cornelius's eye for detail.

Or his personal investment.

Cornelius returned to the vault and forced himself to look past the body. The shelves. The walls. The ceiling. There—near the top corner, where the stone met the iron frame of the door—a thin line of soot. The kind left by a controlled burn.

He climbed the nearest shelf, balancing on a ledge, and sniffed. Definitely soot. But also... yes. Machine oil. The same scent he had detected on yesterday's package.

The package.

Cornelius jumped down and hurried to the main desk. He unlocked the vault transfer drawer and pulled it open.

Empty.

The package was gone.

Of course it was. It had never been "sentimental correspondence." It had been tools. Or keys. Or a schematic, just as he had suspected.

And Elias—nervous, sweating Elias—had delivered the means of his own death.

Cornelius slammed the drawer shut. His claws scored the wood.

Someone had planned this. Used the courier as a tool, then discarded him. The theft was clean, calculated, and utterly ruthless.

And it had happened in *his library*.

"Uh, Cornelius?" Zeph's voice drifted from the back of the building. "You're gonna want to see this."

Cornelius found him in the southern archive room, standing near the ventilation grate. The iron grill had been removed and leaned against the wall. The shaft beyond was dark and narrow.

"Someone used the vents," Zeph said. He pointed to scuff marks on the stone floor near the opening. "Look. Fresh."

Cornelius examined the marks. Boot prints. Large. Male, probably. Or a very tall woman.

He peered into the vent shaft. It ran vertically for six feet, then turned horizontal toward the main building. Too small for a human to navigate comfortably.

But possible. Barely.

"There is more," Zeph said quietly. He gestured toward the corner behind a tall bookshelf.

Cornelius followed his gaze.

A man sat slumped against the wall, half-hidden in shadow. He was older—mid-fifties, with graying hair and the soft hands of wealth. His tunic bore the spiral emblem of House Kallistos. A wine bottle lay empty beside him. In his lap, a rolled parchment.

Petros Kallistos, owner of the vault.

And he was either asleep or unconscious.

Cornelius approached slowly. "Petros."

No response.

He raised his voice. "Petros Kallistos. Wake up."

The man stirred, groaning. His eyes opened—bloodshot, unfocused. He blinked at Cornelius, then at Zeph, then down at the bottle in confusion. "Wha—?"

"You are in the Solterra Bay Library," Cornelius said. His voice was flat, controlled. "You will explain what you are doing here."

Petros rubbed his face. "I... I came to check on the vault. Last night. I heard—" He stopped, his gaze sharpening. "Is it true? Is it open?"

"It is breached. Contents have been stolen. A man is dead." Cornelius tilted his head. "And you were found in my archive room, intoxicated, with a map."

"A map?" Petros looked down at the parchment in his lap as though seeing it for the first time. He unrolled it with shaking hands.

It was a schematic. The library's ventilation system, drawn in meticulous detail.

Cornelius's eyes narrowed. "Where did you get that?"

"I... I do not know." Petros stared at it, his face pale. "I do not remember. I was at the tavern. Someone bought me drinks. We talked about the vault, about the wards. I told him they were strong. I told him..." He trailed off, horror dawning in his expression. "I told him too much."

"Who?" Cornelius demanded. "Who bought you drinks?"

"I do not know his name. Big man. Spoke with an eastern accent. He said he was interested in architecture. In warded buildings." Petros dropped the schematic. "I thought he was just curious. I did not think—"

"You did not think he was gathering intelligence for a theft." Cornelius's tail lashed. "You were manipulated. Plied with alcohol and mined for information."

"I did not mean—"

"Intent is irrelevant." Cornelius turned to Zeph. "Stay with him. Do not let him leave. I am going to summon the Watch."

He stalked toward the main entrance, fury simmering under his scales. Petros had been a fool. A drunk, careless fool who had handed a thief the keys to his own vault.

But he was not the killer.

Someone else had used that information. Someone who knew how to melt iron with magic and kill with poison.

Cornelius reached the front door and pulled it open.

Across the square, leaning against the fountain with his arms crossed, stood Captain Mago Hanno.

The orc was impossible to miss. Seven feet tall, broad-shouldered, with tusks that gleamed in the morning light. He wore the stained coat of a ship captain, and his eyes—dark and cold—were fixed directly on the library.

On Cornelius.

Their gazes met.

Mago did not move. Did not smile. Did not look away.

He simply watched.

A chill ran down Cornelius's spine.

Mago was a smuggler. Everyone knew it. He ran goods through the harbor wards during the Feast, bribed the right officials, and kept his ship clean enough to avoid prosecution. He was dangerous, clever, and utterly without scruple.

And he was watching the library the morning after a theft.

Cornelius stepped back inside and closed the door. His heart pounded against his ribs.

The theft was not random. It was not opportunistic.

It was planned. Professional.

And the man outside—watching, waiting—knew something.

Cornelius locked the door and turned back toward the vault.

His library had been violated. His sanctuary breached. A man had died on his floor, and the wards—ancient, unbreakable wards—had been bypassed as though they were nothing more than a polite suggestion.

The silence was gone.

The safety was gone.

And Cornelius stood in the center of his hoard, surrounded by books and stone and the smell of burnt almonds, and felt the world shift beneath his feet.

He had thought he could observe. Document. Wait for the crime to unfold and meet it with evidence and proof.

He had been wrong.

The crime had already happened.

And he had not been ready.
