# Chapter 11

The book belonged on the third shelf, not the fourth.

Cornelius pulled it free and carried it to its proper location, sliding it into place with a soft *thunk* of leather against leather. The alignment was perfect now. Spines flush. Heights descending from left to right in precise increments.

Order.

He moved to the next shelf.

This section cataloged maritime trade agreements from the previous century. Someone—probably a patron during the Feast—had reshelf a volume on fishing rights between two volumes on harbor taxes. The error made his wings itch.

Cornelius removed all three books, arranged them properly on the floor, and began replacing them in correct chronological order.

His claws moved with mechanical precision. Lift. Place. Align. Check.

The rhythm was soothing.

The rhythm did not require thinking about the Golden Amphora.

Did not require remembering Petros's hollow laugh or the crowd's shifting anger or the way his perfect theory had disintegrated like wet parchment under a single contradictory fact.

Lift. Place. Align. Check.

The books did not care that he had humiliated himself publicly. The books did not whisper about foreign dragons who played detective and accused innocent men of murder. The books simply existed in their proper places, waiting to be shelved correctly.

Cornelius finished the maritime section and moved to the next row.

Philosophy. Ethics. Moral treatises from the Third Reformation.

Two volumes were backwards. Spines facing the wall instead of the aisle.

Unacceptable.

He pulled them free, turned them around, and reshelf them with the same mechanical care. The texture of old leather under his claws was familiar. Safe. Predictable.

Unlike evidence.

Unlike witnesses.

Unlike his own catastrophically flawed deductions.

Cornelius's tail lashed.

The motion knocked a small stack of reference cards off the shelf. They scattered across the floor in a spray of cream-colored parchment.

He stared at them.

Disorder.

His fault.

Always his fault when things fell apart.

He gathered the cards carefully, checking each one for damage, and restacked them in alphabetical order by subject heading. The edges aligned perfectly. He set the stack back on the shelf and adjusted it until it sat at a precise right angle to the shelf edge.

Better.

But the next shelf was a mess too. Books leaning at odd angles. Gaps where volumes had been removed and never replaced. Dust coating the upper corners.

How had he let it get this bad?

How had he let *anything* get this bad?

Cornelius pulled every book from the shelf and began again.

Alphabetical by author. Then chronological within each author's works. Then checked for damage. Then reshelf with spines aligned and heights descending.

The process took fifteen minutes.

It should have taken five.

But his claws kept trembling.

"Okay, that's it."

Zeph's voice cut through the mechanical rhythm like a badly tuned lyre string.

Cornelius did not look up from the shelf. "I am working."

"You're hiding." Footsteps approached across the stone floor. "You've been in here for like three hours."

"I am cataloging. The stacks were in disarray. Proper archival maintenance requires—"

"You're freaking out."

Cornelius's wings flared. "I am *organizing*. There is a difference."

"Yeah? What shelf are you on?"

Cornelius glanced at the label. "Political Theory. Subsection: Governance Models. Third Era."

"And what was the last shelf you did?"

"Maritime Trade. Subsection: Fishing Rights and Harbor—" Cornelius stopped.

That shelf was four rows away.

In a completely different section.

With an entirely different cataloging system.

He had been moving randomly through the stacks, fixing whatever caught his eye, with no systematic plan or logical progression.

The realization made his scales itch.

"You skipped like six whole sections," Zeph said quietly. "You're just... grabbing whatever's closest and making it perfect. Over and over."

Cornelius set down the book he was holding. His claws left small indentations in the leather cover. "The library was in disorder. I was correcting the errors."

"The library's fine. You're the one who's a mess."

The words hit harder than they should have.

Cornelius turned away, focusing on the next shelf. More philosophy. A gap where someone had removed a volume on ethical frameworks and never returned it. He could check the circulation log. Track down the borrower. Demand the book's return.

Except the library was sealed.

And he was not supposed to be inside.

And the circulation logs would not change the fact that he had publicly accused an innocent man of murder based on incomplete evidence and arrogant certainty.

His tail coiled tight around his hindclaws.

"I made an error," Cornelius said. His voice sounded strange. Flat. "A significant error. In public. With witnesses. I followed a logical chain to an incorrect conclusion and presented it as irrefutable fact."

"Yeah." Zeph leaned against the shelf. "You did."

"I humiliated myself. Damaged my credibility. Proved Captain Melas correct in his assessment that I am merely a librarian overstepping my competence." Cornelius's claws flexed against the stone floor. "I demonstrated precisely the kind of intellectual arrogance that leads to catastrophic failure."

"Okay, but—"

"I accused Petros Kallistos of conspiracy and murder when he was physically incapable of committing the crime. I ignored the possibility of alternate explanations. I constructed a theory that confirmed my own assumptions and dismissed evidence that contradicted it." The words tumbled out faster now. Harsher. "I behaved like an amateur. Like someone playing at investigation without understanding the discipline required. Like—"

"Like someone who's scared he screwed up so bad nobody'll ever trust him again?"

Cornelius went very still.

Zeph pushed off from the shelf and moved closer. "Look. You messed up. Yeah. It was bad. But you're not the first person to follow evidence to the wrong place. Happens all the time. You just... gotta step back and look at it different."

"I was *certain*." Cornelius's voice cracked slightly on the word. "The handwriting matched. The note was in Petros's hand. The schematic was in his possession. Every piece of evidence pointed to him as the insider providing access to co-conspirators. The logical chain was sound."

"Except it wasn't."

"Except it was not." Cornelius's wings drooped. "Which means my methodology is flawed. My deductive process is unreliable. I cannot trust my own conclusions."

"Or maybe you just missed something." Zeph crouched down until he was at eye level with Cornelius. "You told me once that the point of documentation is to catch errors. To have a record you can check when your memory's wrong. Right?"

Cornelius nodded slowly.

"So check it." Zeph gestured back toward the main library. "You got all the evidence written down. All the stuff you found. Go back and look at it like you're reading someone else's notes. See what you missed."

"I do not wish to relive my failure in exacting detail."

"Too bad. You're doing it anyway." Zeph stood and held out a hand. "Come on. Before you reorganize the entire philosophy section for no reason."

Cornelius stared at the offered hand.

Then at the stacks around him. Shelves in perfect order. Books aligned with geometric precision. Everything controlled. Everything safe.

Everything meaningless if he could not solve the case that had violated his sanctuary.

He placed his claw in Zeph's palm.

The boy pulled him to his feet and led him out of the stacks, past the reading tables, toward the circulation desk where Cornelius's private ledger sat tucked in the bottom drawer.

The library felt different now. Quieter. Emptier.

Or perhaps that was just the weight of failure pressing down on everything.

Cornelius retrieved his ledger and carried it to the nearest table. The leather cover was worn smooth from handling. Inside, pages of careful notes documented every step of the investigation.

He opened to the first entry.

*Spring Feast, Day One. Dread Level: Moderate.*

It felt like a lifetime ago.

Zeph pulled up a chair and sat backwards on it, arms folded over the back. "Okay. Start from the beginning. What did you actually know? Not what you thought. What did you *see*?"

Cornelius forced himself to focus on the words instead of the shame.

"Elias arrived with a package. Nervous. Sweating. The package smelled of lapis lazuli powder and machine oil. He claimed it contained sentimental correspondence from Eudora of Naxos."

"Evidence of lying?"

"The smell. Lapis and oil are consistent with alchemical reagents or locksmithing materials. Not correspondence."

"But you don't know what was in the package."

"No. It was stolen before I could examine it." Cornelius turned the page. "Later, I observed Sophia Doukas arguing with Elias in the market. She referenced wards, a sequence, and withheld payment until a task was completed."

"So she hired him for something."

"That was my assumption." Cornelius's claw traced the words. "But the conversation could also be interpreted as her *pressuring* him about a task someone else had hired him for. Or negotiating terms for a separate commission entirely."

Zeph leaned forward. "What else?"

"The blue thread on Sister Photine's sandal matched the thread on Sophia's dress hem. I concluded they were connected through shared resources or direct interaction." Cornelius paused. "But thread is not unique. Multiple tailors likely use the same suppliers. The connection is circumstantial."

"Keep going."

Cornelius flipped to the next page. The entry about the handkerchief.

"Sophia carried a handkerchief monogrammed with 'P' that smelled of lilac and turpentine. I interpreted this as evidence of a personal connection to Petros Kallistos, since lilac is his preferred scent."

"And the turpentine?"

"Doukas workshop. Tile glazes and cleaning solutions." Cornelius's tail twitched. "I assumed the dual scents meant Sophia and Petros had been in close physical proximity. Possibly romantic involvement."

"But?"

"But a handkerchief can be borrowed. Stolen. Found. The monogram could belong to someone else entirely. Photine's name begins with P." Cornelius's claws tightened on the ledger edge. "I saw what I expected to see. A secret alliance between rival houses. A conspiracy. I constructed a narrative that fit my assumptions."

Zeph was quiet for a moment. Then: "Okay. But some of that stuff's still true, yeah? Elias *was* lying about the package. Sophia *did* argue with him. The vault *was* robbed."

"Yes."

"So the evidence isn't wrong. Just your explanation of how it connects."

Cornelius turned to the page about the vault code note.

*Vault Code: 4-4-9. Delivery: Third Fourthday, dawn. Payment on completion. Burn this.*

Written in Petros's distinctive, sloppy hand.

"This note was the keystone of my theory," Cornelius said. "Proof that Petros had provided the vault access to co-conspirators. Clear evidence of premeditation and conspiracy."

"Except Petros said Elias asked him to write it."

"While Petros was drunk. Weeks before the theft." Cornelius stared at the words. "I assumed Petros wrote it for Sophia. But what if Elias *solicited* it? What if Elias was the one planning the robbery, and he manipulated Petros into providing the code?"

Zeph's eyes widened. "Holy shit."

"Elias owed money to Mago. Needed a big score. Told Mago he had a 'Kallistos gold' job lined up." Cornelius's mind was moving faster now. Pieces rearranging. "What if Elias was not the expendable courier? What if he was the *planner*?"

"But then who killed him?"

Cornelius turned to a blank page and began writing.

"Assume Elias planned the theft. He needed access to the vault—obtained by manipulating Petros into writing the code. He needed tools to breach the wards—obtained by having Eudora send the package to the vault under false pretenses. He needed a map of the ventilation system—obtained from... whom?"

Zeph frowned. "The schematic was in Petros's lap when we found him."

"Planted there. While he was unconscious." Cornelius wrote faster. "Someone wanted us to think Petros was involved. Wanted the Watch to investigate him instead of the actual conspirators."

"So Elias had a partner."

"Yes." Cornelius's tail uncurled slightly. "Someone with technical expertise. Someone who could draft a detailed ventilation schematic. Someone who knew enough about the library's wards to plan a bypass."

"Sophia?"

"Possibly. She has access to alchemical materials through the tile workshop. She argued with Elias about a task and payment. The timeline fits." Cornelius tapped his claw against the page. "But there is another possibility."

"Who?"

"Alexandros Doukas." Cornelius flipped back to his earlier notes. "Observed at the rear delivery alley, wearing heavy leather gloves in warm weather. Intercepted Eudora when she came to inquire about the package. Steered her away from further questions."

Zeph leaned over the ledger. "You think he and Elias were working together?"

"I think Elias approached someone who could provide technical expertise and alchemical materials. Someone who needed access to the Kallistos correspondence for political or financial leverage. They planned the theft together." Cornelius wrote the names in two columns. "Elias obtained the vault code and delivery access. His partner provided the tools and the plan. They split the stolen documents."

"And then what? The partner killed Elias?"

"Or Elias got greedy. Tried to renegotiate the split. Threatened to expose his partner unless he received a larger share." Cornelius's claws moved across the page, connecting lines between pieces of evidence. "The partnership soured. One of them deployed the poison. The other ended up dead in the vault."

Zeph whistled softly. "Okay. So... how do we prove it?"

Cornelius stared at the diagram he had sketched. Names. Connections. Question marks where evidence was thin.

It was not perfect.

But it was not *wrong*.

Not built on assumptions and arrogance.

Built on documented observations and alternate possibilities.

"We need to know what was in the package," Cornelius said finally. "Eudora sent it. She knows what it contained. If we can determine the nature of the tool used to breach the vault, we can trace it back to whoever provided it."

"Eudora wouldn't talk to you before."

"Because I approached her as an investigator. Asking questions she refused to answer." Cornelius's wings rustled. "But she *did* express concern about the package's value. She wanted compensation."

"So?"

"So we approach her as a fellow victim. Someone who lost valuable property in the theft." Cornelius closed the ledger carefully. "We offer information about the investigation in exchange for information about the package. A trade. Mutual benefit."

Zeph grinned. "You want to *gossip* with her."

"I want to conduct a strategic exchange of relevant intelligence."

"That's gossip."

Cornelius's tail swished with irritation, but there was no real heat behind it. The frantic, spiraling shame had receded. Replaced by something cooler. Clearer.

Purpose.

"If Eudora hired Elias to deliver the package, she may know who else Elias was working with. Financial records. Correspondence. Witnesses to their interactions." Cornelius stood, gathering the ledger against his chest. "She is the connection between Elias and whoever provided the vault-breaking tool. If we can convince her to share that information—"

"We find the partner," Zeph finished. "And the partner's probably the killer."

"Precisely."

Zeph pushed back from the table and stood. "So we're doing this? Going back to talk to the person who already told you to screw off once?"

Cornelius adjusted his spectacles. "I am doing this. You may remain here if you prefer. After my public failure at the Golden Amphora, I would understand if you wished to distance yourself from—"

"Dude. Shut up." Zeph crossed his arms. "I don't care if you messed up. You're still gonna solve this thing. You just gotta stop being so sure you're right before you actually prove it."

The words should have stung.

Instead, they settled like a weight Cornelius had been carrying without realizing. Heavy. But not crushing.

True.

"I will endeavor to maintain appropriate skepticism regarding my own conclusions," Cornelius said carefully.

"Great. Now let's go bug Eudora until she tells us what was in that package." Zeph headed toward the rear delivery entrance, the same route they had used to sneak in. "You think she's still in town? Or did she bail after the theft?"

"She demanded compensation. She will not leave until she receives it or confirms its impossibility." Cornelius followed, ledger tucked securely under one wing. "Merchants do not abandon potential profit easily."

They reached the rear door. Zeph cracked it open and checked the alley.

"Clear."

They slipped out into the narrow space between buildings. The Spring Feast crowds were audible in the distance—voices and music and the clatter of commerce. But here, in the shadowed gap behind the library, the world was quiet.

Cornelius paused at the threshold and looked back at the stone wall.

His sanctuary. His hoard.

Still sealed by the Watch. Still technically forbidden to him.

But no longer a place of retreat and shame.

A place to think. To organize. To find the patterns hidden in chaos.

He had been wrong about Petros.

But he was not wrong about everything.

Someone had stolen from the library. Someone had killed Elias. Someone had violated the sanctuary and thought they could escape consequences.

And Cornelius Drake, Curator and Guardian, was going to prove exactly who that someone was.

With documentation.

With evidence.

And this time, with appropriate epistemic humility.

He turned away from the library and followed Zeph into the alley, toward the harbor district and the merchant houses where Eudora of Naxos kept her offices.

The case was not solved.

But it was not over either.
