# Chapter 14

The library steps were empty.

Cornelius stood at the base of the wide stone staircase and stared up at the iron-banded doors. Still sealed. Still barred. The heavy storm-season locks Captain Melas had installed gleamed dully in the lamplight from the street sconces.

His library. His sanctuary. His *hoard*.

Locked against him.

Cornelius's throat ached. The bruises from Alexandros's grip had settled into a persistent, throbbing pain that sharpened every time he swallowed. He had walked the long way back from the market square—through crowded side streets where witnesses could see him, avoiding dark alleys and quiet corners—and his legs trembled with exhaustion.

The market had been nearly empty when he arrived. The Feast musicians packing up their drums. Vendors closing stalls. The crowds already dispersing toward home and bed.

And no sign of Zeph.

Cornelius had searched. Had circled the plaza twice. Had even asked a bored-looking stall keeper if he had seen a tall, gangly boy with bronze-sheened hair.

"Lots of kids here tonight," the man had said, shrugging. "All look the same after a while."

So Cornelius had given up and come here. To the only place that felt remotely safe despite the Watch seals and his forced exile.

He mounted the steps slowly. One at a time. Claws clicking against stone worn smooth by centuries of foot traffic.

Halfway up, he spotted the bundle.

Not a bundle.

A person.

Curled against the library's left pillar where the overhang created a small sheltered alcove. Dark clothes blending into shadow. Knees drawn up. Head pillowed on folded arms.

Zeph.

Cornelius stopped. His wings rustled involuntarily.

The boy was *asleep*. Here. On the cold stone steps. In clothes that were clearly inadequate for spending the night outdoors.

Why?

Cornelius approached carefully. Quietly. His investigator's eye catalogued details automatically: the way Zeph's shoulders rose and fell with deep, even breaths. The smudge of what might be pastry sugar on his collar. The scuffed knees of his trousers from kneeling or sitting somewhere rough.

He looked young. Unbearably young.

Sixteen. Still a child by human standards, even if he pretended otherwise.

And Cornelius had yelled at him. Had dismissed his very reasonable request for rest. Had treated him like an obstacle instead of a partner.

Had driven him away.

And yet here Zeph was. Sleeping outside the sealed library like a faithful hound waiting for its master to return.

Cornelius's chest hurt. Not from the bruises. From something else entirely.

He should wake the boy. Should apologize. Should—

"He has been here since sunset."

Cornelius spun, wings flaring defensively.

A figure stood in the deeper shadows near the library's side entrance. Tall. Slender. Moving forward into the lamplight with the unhurried grace of someone who had all the time in the world.

Imelda Kassiani. Head Librarian.

Cornelius's wings folded immediately. "I did not hear you approach."

"You were focused elsewhere." Imelda's voice was calm. Measured. The kind of voice that could soothe panicked students during exam season or silence rowdy children with a single raised eyebrow. She moved to stand beside Cornelius, looking down at Zeph's sleeping form. "He came here looking for you. When I told him you had not returned, he said he would wait."

"On the steps?"

"I offered him my office couch. He refused." Imelda's silver braids gleamed faintly in the lamplight. Her ink-stained hands were clasped loosely in front of her. "He said he wanted to be where you would see him first. In case you came back worried."

The words landed like small stones in still water.

*In case you came back worried.*

Zeph had been waiting. Not because Cornelius had ordered him to. Not because it was his job.

Because he cared.

Cornelius swallowed. The movement sent a fresh spike of pain through his bruised throat.

Imelda's gaze sharpened. "You are hurt."

"It is nothing."

"Cornelius."

The single word carried the weight of nearly two centuries. Imelda had been Head Librarian when Cornelius first established his hoard in Solterra Bay. Had helped him navigate the city's bureaucratic maze to secure the Curator position. Had taught him which families to court and which to avoid.

She was the only human whose authority he respected without reservation.

"I had an encounter," Cornelius said carefully. His voice came out rougher than intended. "With Alexandros Doukas. He made his position regarding my investigation quite clear."

Imelda's expression did not change. But something shifted in her eyes. A cooling. A hardening.

"I see." She gestured toward the side entrance. "Come. We should talk before you wake the boy."

Cornelius glanced at Zeph. Still sleeping. Still curled against the pillar.

"He will be safe," Imelda said. "The Watch patrol passes every twenty minutes. And I will keep watch from the alcove window."

Cornelius followed her to the side door. She produced a key—her own, distinct from the master Cornelius had surrendered—and unlocked the smaller entrance that led to the staff corridors.

The library's interior was dark. Silent. The familiar vanilla-and-dust scent wrapped around Cornelius like a blanket.

*Home.*

He had not realized how desperately he had missed it until this moment.

Imelda did not light the lamps. She moved through the corridors with the confidence of someone who knew every stone and corner by heart. Cornelius followed, his night vision more than adequate for the dim space.

They stopped in the narrow hall outside the administrative offices. Close enough to the alcove window that Imelda could keep her promise about watching Zeph. Far enough from the sealed vault that Cornelius did not feel the immediate prickle of violation.

"Tell me," Imelda said.

So Cornelius told her. Not everything. Not the full timeline of his investigation or the humiliating failure with Petros. Just the relevant parts.

Eudora hiring Elias to steal the Kallistos glaze formula.

Elias promising delivery and dying before he could complete the job.

Cornelius's theory about industrial espionage and tile-market competition.

And then, more quietly, Alexandros Doukas. The threat in the alley. The grip on his throat. The scent of ozone and burnt almond that marked the man as the vault-breaker and Elias's killer.

Imelda listened without interruption. When Cornelius finished, she was silent for a long moment.

Then she said, "The Kallistos correspondence. You believe it contained the glaze formula?"

"Eudora was quite specific. She paid Elias fifty silver crescents to retrieve it from the family vault."

"Mm." Imelda's fingers drummed once against her forearm. A considering gesture. "And you have operated under the assumption that the vault contained House Kallistos's proprietary trade secrets?"

"Yes. Recipes. Ratios. Manufacturing processes. Anything that would give a competitor an advantage in the luxury tile market."

"I see." Imelda tilted her head slightly. "May I offer an alternative interpretation?"

Cornelius's wings rustled. "Please."

"The Kallistos vault does not contain tile recipes." Imelda's voice was gentle. Patient. The tone she used when correcting a student's fundamental misunderstanding. "It contains letters. Personal correspondence dating back forty years."

The words took a moment to process.

Letters.

Not business documents. Not manufacturing secrets.

*Letters.*

"I do not understand," Cornelius said slowly.

"The old patriarch—Petros's grandfather—kept a mistress. A merchant's daughter from one of the smaller islands. Very beautiful. Very scandalous." Imelda's expression was neutral. Archival. "He wrote to her frequently during the years of their affair. She wrote back. When she died, the letters were purchased by House Kallistos to prevent their circulation. They have been locked in the family vault ever since."

Cornelius stared at her.

His entire theory. The industrial espionage framework. The tile-market competition.

*Wrong.*

"But Eudora said—"

"Eudora was told what Elias wanted her to believe." Imelda's ink-stained hands gestured slightly. "Think, Cornelius. If you were planning to steal valuable correspondence and needed funding, would you tell your patron the truth? Or would you offer them something they desperately wanted?"

The glaze formula.

Eudora had been desperate for it. Willing to pay handsomely. Willing to overlook the legal and ethical problems of commissioning theft.

Elias had used that desperation.

Had lied about what he was actually planning to steal.

"He sold her a fiction," Cornelius said. His mind was racing. Reorganizing. "Made her believe she was funding industrial espionage when in fact—"

"He was stealing blackmail material." Imelda nodded. "Love letters from a powerful family's patriarch. Written proof of an affair that would embarrass House Kallistos even now, decades after the principals' deaths. That kind of leverage is worth far more than a tile recipe."

"But who would pay for such letters?"

"Anyone with a grievance against House Kallistos. Anyone seeking political advantage. Anyone who trades in secrets and reputation." Imelda's gaze was steady. "Mago Hanno, for instance, deals in more than smuggled fireworks. Information is a very liquid currency in the harbor district."

Cornelius's claws scraped against stone.

Not industrial espionage.

*Blackmail.*

Elias had planned to steal the letters. Had recruited someone with technical skill—Alexandros—to breach the vault. Had intended to sell the correspondence to the highest bidder.

And something had gone wrong.

A betrayal. A double-cross. A partnership that collapsed into murder.

"How do you know this?" Cornelius asked. "About the letters?"

"I have been Head Librarian for sixty-three years." Imelda's voice was dry. Amused. "I know what is stored in every vault in this building. It is my job."

Of course she did.

Cornelius felt a familiar prickle of embarrassment. He had been so focused on his own investigation. So caught up in proving his competence after the Petros debacle. That he had not thought to simply *ask* the person who actually managed the vault records.

"I should have consulted you earlier," he said stiffly.

"Yes. You should have." But Imelda's tone was not unkind. "You are a brilliant cataloguer, Cornelius. And you have a dragon's instinct for protecting your hoard. But you are not a detective by training. And you do not always recognize when you need help."

The words stung because they were true.

Cornelius's tail coiled. "Alexandros Doukas killed Elias. I am certain of it. The scent evidence—"

"Will not be sufficient for Captain Melas without corroborating proof." Imelda cut him off gently but firmly. "You know this. Scent is not admissible in a Council trial unless verified by an alchemist. And Alexandros has the resources to dispute any chemical analysis."

"Then what do I do?"

Imelda regarded him for a long moment. Then she smiled. It was a small expression. Warm.

"You do what you have always done best. You document. You organize. You build an airtight case from observable facts." She gestured toward the depths of the library. "And you let your friends help you."

Friends.

The word settled around Cornelius like a cloak.

He glanced toward the alcove window. Through the glass he could just make out the shape of Zeph still curled against the pillar outside.

"I was unkind to him," Cornelius said quietly. "Earlier. At the market. He asked for a break and I dismissed him as frivolous."

"I know. He told me." Imelda's voice was matter-of-fact. "He also told me you have been working yourself into exhaustion trying to solve this case alone. Trying to prove you are competent after the incident with Petros Kallistos."

Cornelius's wings folded tight. "I do not wish to discuss—"

"You were wrong about Petros. You are allowed to be wrong, Cornelius." Imelda's tone gentled. "Being wrong once does not make you incompetent. It makes you fallible. Like the rest of us."

The words should have been humiliating.

Instead they felt oddly... liberating.

Cornelius had spent so much energy these past days trying to prove he was infallible. Trying to force the evidence into neat patterns that demonstrated his brilliance.

What if he simply accepted that he had made mistakes? That he needed help? That solving this case mattered more than protecting his pride?

"Go wake your apprentice," Imelda said. "Apologize properly. Then come inside and work together. I will make tea."

She turned and walked deeper into the library, silver braids swaying.

Cornelius stood alone in the corridor.

Then he moved back toward the side entrance. Out onto the steps.

Zeph was still sleeping. His breathing had gotten slightly irregular. The kind of shift that suggested he was close to waking naturally.

Cornelius approached carefully. Sat down on the stone step beside the boy's curled form.

Up close, he could see the smudge of pastry sugar more clearly. Could see the faint dark circles under Zeph's eyes. The way his hands were tucked under his chin for warmth.

He had waited here. For hours. In the cold.

Because he cared.

Cornelius reached out and gently tapped Zeph's shoulder with one claw.

The boy jerked awake immediately. Eyes flying open. Body tensing.

"Easy," Cornelius said. His rough voice came out softer than intended. "It is only me."

Zeph blinked. Oriented. Focused on Cornelius's face.

Then he scrambled upright, nearly banging his head on the pillar. "Cornelius! Where were you? I went back to the square and you were—" He stopped. His gaze sharpened. "What happened to your throat?"

Cornelius's wing moved instinctively to cover the bruises. "I am fine."

"You're not fine. There are *finger marks*." Zeph leaned closer, expression shifting from sleepy confusion to sharp alarm. "Who grabbed you?"

"Alexandros Doukas." No point in lying. Zeph would extract the truth eventually. "He intercepted me in an alley near the baths. Made it quite clear that continued investigation would result in unfortunate accidents."

Zeph's hands curled into fists. "That—he can't just—you need to tell Captain Melas!"

"And say what? That a respected artisan-merchant spoke to me in a public alley? That I *smelled* chemicals on him?" Cornelius shook his head. "Theo already considers me an obstruction. Without proof, an accusation would only make things worse."

"So he just gets away with it?"

"No. We build a case he cannot dispute." Cornelius met Zeph's eyes. "But I cannot do that alone. And I should not have tried."

Zeph went very still. "What?"

"I was wrong. Earlier. At the market." The words came with difficulty. Cornelius was not practiced at apologies. "You asked for a reasonable accommodation. A brief rest during a festival. And I dismissed you as frivolous because I was too focused on proving my own competence after the Petros incident."

"I mean, yeah. You were kind of a jerk about it." But Zeph's voice had lost its sharp edge. "I figured you were just stressed."

"Stress does not excuse poor behavior. You are not my errand boy. You are my apprentice. My partner in this investigation." Cornelius's tail swished once. "And I owe you an apology. I am sorry."

Zeph stared at him for a long moment.

Then the boy's face split into a tired but genuine grin. "Thanks. That... actually means a lot."

"You were also correct that I have been obsessing. Using the investigation to avoid thinking about my failures." Cornelius forced himself to continue. "I do not like being wrong. It makes me feel incompetent. So I try to prove I am always right, which leads to poor judgment and—" He gestured vaguely. "This."

"Getting choked in an alley?"

"Among other things."

Zeph's grin faded into something more serious. "So what do we do now?"

*We.*

Not *you*. Not Cornelius alone against the world.

*We.*

Cornelius felt something in his chest unclench.

"Now we go inside. Imelda has offered her office and is making tea. And we organize what we know." He stood, offering Zeph his wing in a steadying gesture. "Starting with the fact that I have been operating under a completely incorrect assumption about the stolen correspondence."

Zeph hauled himself to his feet, joints popping. "What do you mean?"

"The Kallistos vault does not contain tile recipes. It contains love letters from the old patriarch to his mistress. Forty years of personal correspondence that would severely embarrass the family if made public."

Zeph's eyes went wide. "Wait. So Elias wasn't stealing business secrets?"

"No. He was stealing blackmail material. And he lied to Eudora about what he was actually after to secure her funding." Cornelius started toward the side entrance. "Which reframes the entire motive structure."

"Because love letters are worth more than tile recipes?"

"In the right hands, yes. Reputation and honor are currencies just as valuable as silver." Cornelius pushed open the door. The library's familiar scent washed over him. "And someone was willing to kill to keep those letters."

Zeph followed him inside. "Alexandros."

"Almost certainly. But we still need to establish how and why Elias's partnership with Alexandros collapsed into murder."

They walked through the dark corridors toward the glow of lamplight spilling from Imelda's office. The Head Librarian had indeed made tea. The scent of mint and honey filled the small space.

Imelda gestured them to the chairs arranged around her desk. "Sit. Drink. Then we work."

Cornelius climbed onto the chair—specially reinforced to hold a small dragon's weight—and accepted the cup Zeph handed him. The warm ceramic felt good against his claws.

He sipped. The mint was not quite as fresh as the bundle Zeph had brought him days ago, but it was still soothing.

Zeph gulped his tea like someone who had spent hours in the cold and desperately needed warmth.

"All right," Cornelius said. Setting his cup down carefully. "Let us organize what we know. Fact-by-fact. No assumptions."

"Elias delivered a package to the Kallistos vault," Zeph offered. "We saw him do it."

"Correct. The package smelled of lapis lazuli powder and machine oil. Residue consistent with lock-picking tools or alchemical reagents."

"The vault was breached the next night," Imelda added. "The iron seal melted by high-heat accelerants."

"And Elias died inside the vault." Zeph's voice was quieter now. "Poisoned."

Cornelius nodded. "I smelled burnt almond near his body. I initially catalogued it as cyanide."

"But?" Zeph prompted.

Cornelius's claws tapped against his teacup. "But when Alexandros grabbed me tonight, he smelled of burnt almond *and* ozone. The exact scent profile from the vault breach."

"So he was there. Physically there." Zeph leaned forward. "That proves—"

"It proves proximity. Not necessarily guilt." Cornelius held up a claw. "We must be precise. The scent tells us Alexandros handled high-heat alchemical compounds recently. The same compounds used to melt the vault seal."

Imelda's fingers drummed once on her desk. "Burnt almond. Not cyanide?"

"I thought it was cyanide initially. But cyanide leaves other markers. Skin discoloration. Specific tissue damage. Sister Photine checked for those signs and ruled them out."

"So what smells like burnt almond but is not cyanide?" Zeph asked.

Cornelius's mind turned the question over. Cataloguing. Cross-referencing against his extensive knowledge of library preservation and—

No.

Not library knowledge.

*Tile-making* knowledge.

He had researched the Doukas family workshop when investigating Sophia. Had read about their kiln processes. Their specialized glazes. Their high-temperature firing techniques.

Tile kilns used accelerants to achieve the extreme heat required for certain finishes.

Those accelerants were alchemically treated compounds. Mixed with metal filings and reagents that—

Cornelius went very still.

"What?" Zeph was watching him. "You just got your 'I figured something out' face."

"Tile kiln accelerant," Cornelius said slowly. "It is an alchemical compound used to boost kiln temperatures beyond what natural fire can achieve. It smells of burnt almond when it burns. And it leaves ozone residue when combined with a magical catalyst."

"So Alexandros used kiln accelerant to melt the vault seal," Imelda said. Not a question. A confirmation.

"Yes. The exact tool of his trade. Something he would have ready access to. Something he would know how to handle safely." Cornelius's claws flexed. "And if Elias inhaled those fumes in a confined space—"

"The vault is small," Zeph said. "No ventilation except that one grate."

"Exactly. Alexandros melts the seal. The accelerant burns. The fumes fill the vault." Cornelius could see it now. The sequence of events clicking into place. "Elias is inside, waiting. He inhales the fumes. They are toxic in concentrated doses."

"So it wasn't murder-murder," Zeph said slowly. "It was like... accidental?"

"Or deliberate negligence." Imelda's voice was cold. "If Alexandros knew the fumes were lethal and chose to use the accelerant anyway."

Cornelius thought of the melted seal. The careful, controlled burn. The precision of the breach.

Alexandros had known exactly what he was doing.

Had known the fumes would fill the vault.

Had either not warned Elias, or had not cared.

"It was not cyanide," Cornelius said quietly. His throat ached. His wings were folded tight. "It was fire."
