# Chapter 12

The market square was *loud*.

Cornelius stood at the edge of the Loggia and resisted the urge to turn around and retreat to the library's silent stone sanctuary. The Spring Feast had transformed the orderly plaza into a riot of color and noise. Merchants shouted over each other. Musicians competed for attention from opposite corners. The smell of frying dough and roasted meat hung thick in the air.

And somewhere in this chaos, Eudora of Naxos was conducting business.

"There." Zeph pointed toward a fabric merchant's stall near the fountain. "Blue dress. Carrying the leather case."

Cornelius's eyes followed the direction. Yes. Eudora stood at a pigment seller's table, examining small clay jars with the focused intensity of someone evaluating expensive merchandise.

"She is purchasing supplies," Cornelius observed. "Interesting."

"Why's that interesting?"

"Because she claimed her missing package was irreplaceable. Yet here she is, replacing it." Cornelius adjusted his spectacles and started forward. "Come. We have questions."

The crowd pressed close as they moved through the square. Bodies jostled. Feet stomped dangerously near Cornelius's tail. Someone's basket caught on his wing and he had to pull free with a sharp tug that left his scales bristling.

This entire festival was a violation of proper spatial organization.

They reached the pigment seller's stall just as Eudora was handing over a small purse of coins. The merchant—a weathered woman with blue-stained hands—wrapped three clay jars in cloth and placed them carefully in Eudora's leather case.

"Eudora of Naxos," Cornelius said.

The woman turned. Her expression shifted from neutral transaction mode to cold recognition in the space of a heartbeat.

"You." She closed the leather case with a sharp *snap*. "I told you I would speak only to the Watch."

"And I have new information that may assist in recovering your property." Cornelius kept his voice level. Professional. "Specifically regarding Elias of Tyre's final movements before his death."

Eudora's hand tightened on the case handle. "I am busy."

"This will take only a moment. Unless you prefer I share my findings with Captain Melas first, and allow him to draw his own conclusions about your involvement?"

It was a bluff. Cornelius had no intention of returning to Theo with incomplete information and risking another public humiliation. But Eudora did not know that.

Her jaw tightened. "One moment. Not here."

She gestured toward a quieter corner of the square, away from the main flow of foot traffic. Cornelius followed, Zeph trailing behind.

When they were out of immediate earshot of the crowd, Eudora stopped and turned to face them. "What do you want?"

"I want to know what was in the package you sent to the Kallistos vault."

"I already told you—"

"You told me it was private. You demanded compensation. You showed no grief when I informed you Elias was dead." Cornelius's tail swished. "But you did not tell me what the package actually contained. And I believe that information is relevant to determining who killed your courier."

Eudora's expression flickered. Something that might have been fear or calculation or simply exhaustion.

"Why should I tell you anything?" she asked. "You are not the Watch. You have no authority."

"No. But I am the Curator of the library where your courier died. And I have access to records and observations Captain Melas does not." Cornelius folded his wings carefully. "I know Elias was in debt to Mago Hanno. I know he told Mago he had a 'Kallistos gold' job that would clear his debts. I know he delivered your package to the vault the day before he died."

Eudora went very still.

"What I do not know," Cornelius continued, "is what you paid him to deliver. Or why it was valuable enough to justify the risk of placing it in a warded vault."

The silence stretched between them. Market noise swirled around the quiet corner but Eudora's attention was fixed entirely on Cornelius now.

"It was not valuable," she said finally. Her voice was flat. Defeated. "Not the way you think."

"Explain."

Eudora glanced at Zeph, then back to Cornelius. "If I tell you, it stays between us. Not the Watch. Not the Council. Not House Kallistos."

"I cannot promise—"

"Then we are done." She turned to leave.

"Wait." Cornelius's claws scraped against stone. He hated bargaining. Hated dealing in conditional truths and partial disclosures. But he needed this information. "I will keep your confidence unless it directly implicates you in Elias's death or the vault theft."

Eudora studied him for a long moment. Then her shoulders sagged slightly. "It was a formula. A glaze formula."

Cornelius's wings rustled. "For tiles."

"Yes. Kallistos blue. The exact combination of lapis, copper oxide, and flux that gives their tiles that specific color. Their grandfather developed it forty years ago and they have kept it locked in the family vault ever since." Eudora's hand tightened on the leather case. "I paid Elias to steal it for me."

The market noise seemed to fade slightly. Cornelius's mind raced, cataloging implications.

Industrial espionage.

Not blackmail. Not political leverage. Not family secrets.

*Tile glaze*.

"You hired him to commit theft," Cornelius said carefully.

"I hired him to retrieve a formula that should never have been locked away in the first place." There was heat in Eudora's voice now. Bitterness. "House Kallistos has controlled the luxury tile market for decades because of that blue. They price their work at triple what anyone else can charge. They refuse to license the formula. They strangle competition."

"So you decided to steal it."

"I decided to *acquire* it through an independent contractor and level the market." Eudora lifted her chin. "Elias said he had a contact who could get him into the vault. Someone who owed him a favor. He promised me the formula by sunset on Thirdday. I was to meet him at the Broken Mast tavern and pay him the second half of his fee."

"But he never arrived."

"No. He did not." Eudora's expression hardened. "I waited three hours. Then I heard the rumors about a body in the library vault. I assumed he had been caught. Arrested. I did not know he was dead until you told me."

Cornelius's claws flexed against stone. The timeline was tightening. Elias had died sometime between delivering the package on Secondday afternoon and the scheduled sunset meeting on Thirdday.

"The package you sent," Cornelius said. "What did it contain?"

"Payment. Half up front, as agreed. Fifty silver crescents sewn into the lining of a correspondence folder." Eudora's voice was bitter. "Marked for the Kallistos vault to avoid suspicion. Elias was supposed to retrieve the formula, take his payment from the package, and bring me the documents."

"But the package was stolen along with the Kallistos correspondence."

"So I lost both my money and my formula." Eudora's hand moved to the leather case at her side. "Which is why I am buying lapis from a market stall instead of commissioning proper pigment from Naxos. Because I spent my capital on a failed theft and now I am trying to reverse-engineer the damn formula myself."

The pieces were rearranging in Cornelius's mind. Not a conspiracy between rival houses. Not Petros and Sophia working together.

Eudora hiring Elias to steal the Kallistos glaze formula.

Elias promising her success and taking half the payment up front.

Elias dying before he could complete the delivery.

"Who was his contact?" Cornelius asked. "The person who was supposed to help him access the vault?"

"He never told me. Said it was safer if I did not know." Eudora shook her head. "I assumed it was someone in House Kallistos. A servant with access to the vault codes. Or maybe one of the junior family members who needed money."

Cornelius thought of Petros slumped in his chair at the Golden Amphora. Drunk. Broken. Insisting he had only written the vault code because Elias asked him to while he was too plastered to think straight.

Was that the truth? Or had Petros been lying about the extent of his involvement?

No.

Petros had been in the Watch drunk tank the night of the theft. Captain Melas could verify that alibi with a single records check.

Which meant Elias's "contact" was someone else.

Someone who had access to the vault system. Knowledge of the wards. The technical skill to breach the seals.

Someone who had killed Elias when the partnership went wrong.

"The jars you just purchased," Cornelius said, gesturing toward the leather case. "Lapis pigment?"

"And copper oxide and silica flux." Eudora's voice was tired. "I am trying to replicate the formula through experimentation. It will take months. Maybe years. And I will never achieve the exact shade. But it is all I have left."

"You are committing the same theft. Simply using a different method."

"I am conducting research." Eudora's eyes were hard. "House Kallistos does not own the *concept* of blue glaze. Only their specific formulation. If I develop my own variant through independent testing, there is no theft."

It was a technical distinction. A legal fiction.

But Cornelius could not argue with her underlying point. Knowledge locked in vaults and hoarded by families *was* a perversion of how information should flow.

He just wished it had not resulted in murder.

"If you think of anything else about Elias's contact," Cornelius said, "any detail he mentioned about how he planned to access the vault—"

"I will tell the Watch." Eudora adjusted her grip on the case. "Not you. I have already said too much to a dragon with no legal authority and a reputation for public accusations."

The words hit harder than they should have.

Cornelius's wings folded tight against his back. "I am attempting to solve a murder."

"You are attempting to salvage your pride." Eudora's voice was not unkind. Just matter-of-fact. "I understand the impulse. But I will not risk my business or my freedom on your amateur investigation. If you discover the killer, bring your evidence to Captain Melas. Let the Watch do their job."

She turned and walked back toward the market crowds, leather case held close to her side.

Cornelius stood frozen. The noise of the Feast pressed in around him. Vendors shouting. Musicians playing. Laughter and argument and the constant shuffle of feet across stone.

Amateur investigation.

Salvaging pride.

Public accusations.

His claws scraped against the ground.

"Well," Zeph said from beside him. "That was... something."

Cornelius forced himself to move. To think. To process the new information instead of dwelling on Eudora's assessment of his competence.

"She hired Elias to steal the glaze formula," he said. His voice sounded clipped even to his own ears. "Industrial espionage. Not political blackmail or family secrets. Simply a trade formula."

"Yeah. I got that part." Zeph shifted his weight. "So... what now?"

"Now we determine who Elias's contact was. The person who actually committed the vault breach." Cornelius's mind was already racing through possibilities. "Someone with technical knowledge. Access to alchemical materials. Familiarity with the library's ward system."

"The Doukas family?"

"Possibly. Sophia has the workshop access. Alexandros has demonstrated suspicious behavior." Cornelius started walking back toward the main square, thoughts churning. "We need to cross-reference their movements against the timeline. Determine who had opportunity during the critical window between—"

"Whoa. Hey. Cornelius."

Cornelius stopped. Turned.

Zeph was not following. He stood at the edge of the quieter corner, hands shoved in his pockets, expression uncertain.

"What is wrong?" Cornelius asked.

"Nothing's *wrong*. Just... we've been running around all day. Chasing down Eudora. Cataloging evidence. Rebuilding theories." Zeph gestured vaguely toward the Feast crowds. "Can we maybe take a break? Like, five minutes to just... exist?"

"This is a murder investigation. There is no time for—"

"There's musicians over there." Zeph pointed toward the fountain where a group of performers had set up drums and string instruments. "And I haven't eaten anything except those dry rolls you packed this morning. And the Feast only happens once a year and I'm supposed to be enjoying it, not spending every second being your assistant."

The words stung.

Cornelius's tail coiled. "I did not realize my investigation was such an imposition."

"That's not what I meant—"

"You are free to leave at any time. I have never forced you to participate in this inquiry." Cornelius's wings rustled with irritation. "If you would prefer to spend your afternoon listening to badly tuned lyres and eating fried dough, I will not stop you."

Zeph's expression hardened. "You know what? Fine. Yeah. I'll do that."

"Excellent. I will continue pursuing actual leads while you indulge in frivolous—"

"God, do you even *hear* yourself?" Zeph's voice rose slightly. Not quite shouting but loud enough that a few passersby glanced over. "You're doing it again. Acting like you're the only one who cares about solving this. Like everyone else is just stupid or lazy for wanting to take five minutes to breathe."

"I am simply maintaining focus on the relevant—"

"You're obsessing. Same as when you were reorganizing the stacks for three hours." Zeph crossed his arms. "You mess up once and now you're trying to prove you're the smartest person in the room by working yourself into the ground. And you're dragging me with you."

"I am not dragging anyone. You chose to—"

"I chose to help because I thought we were partners. Not because I wanted to be your errand boy while you chase down the next theory that's probably gonna fall apart just like the Petros thing."

The market noise seemed very loud suddenly.

Cornelius stood perfectly still, wings folded, tail coiled tight around his hindclaws.

"If you have so little faith in my investigative abilities," he said quietly, "then perhaps you should not waste your time assisting me further."

Zeph stared at him. Something that might have been hurt flickered across his face before hardening into anger.

"You know what? You're right. I'm gonna go waste my time somewhere else." He turned and started walking toward the fountain where the musicians were playing. "Have fun solving the case all by yourself."

"Zeph—"

But the boy was already gone, swallowed by the crowd of Feast-goers clustered around the performers.

Cornelius stood alone at the edge of the square.

People flowed around him. Merchants hawked their wares. The scent of fried pastries and grilled meat hung thick in the air. Someone nearby was arguing about the price of silk. A child laughed. A dog barked.

The world continued its chaotic spin, indifferent to the small dragon standing frozen in the middle of it all.

He should go after Zeph. Apologize. Explain that he was not trying to be dismissive or controlling, he was simply—

Simply what?

Terrified of failing again?

Desperate to prove he was competent despite the humiliation at the Golden Amphora?

Using the investigation as a way to avoid thinking about how thoroughly he had misjudged Petros and exposed his own arrogance?

Cornelius's claws flexed against stone.

Zeph was right. He was obsessing. Chasing leads without pause. Treating every interaction as another step toward vindication instead of... what? Collaboration? Partnership?

He should apologize.

He turned toward the fountain, scanning the crowd for Zeph's distinctive bronze-sheened hair.

There. Near the musicians. Standing with a small group of teenagers who were clapping along to the drumbeat.

Zeph's shoulders were relaxed. He was smiling. Laughing at something one of the other kids said.

He looked lighter. Happier.

Free of the weight of Cornelius's obsessive investigation.

Cornelius watched him for a long moment. Then turned away.

Zeph deserved a break. Deserved to enjoy the Feast like a normal teenager instead of being dragged through markets and interrogations and the meticulous reconstruction of murder timelines.

And Cornelius could continue the investigation alone. He had done it for days before bringing Zeph more officially into the inquiry. He could manage a few more hours.

He would apologize later. After he had made real progress. After he had something concrete to show for all the running around and questioning.

After he had proven that his methods *worked*.

Cornelius adjusted his spectacles and started walking.

Not toward the library—still sealed by the Watch.

Not toward the Doukas estate—he had already questioned Sophia and learned what he could from that angle.

Toward his small rented room above the cartographer's shop. Where his private ledger waited. Where he could sit and think and organize the new information without the chaos of the Feast pressing in around him.

The walk took fifteen minutes through crowded streets and narrow alleys. The noise faded gradually as he moved away from the main square. By the time he reached the quiet side street where the cartographer's shop sat wedged between a bookbinder and a pottery merchant, the only sound was the distant murmur of the Feast crowds and the soft *tap tap tap* of his claws on cobblestones.

He climbed the exterior stairs to his second-floor room. Unlocked the door with the small key he kept on a chain around his neck. Stepped inside.

The room was exactly as he had left it this morning. Narrow bed with precisely tucked corners. Writing desk positioned beneath the window for optimal natural light—not that he cared about sunlight, but the position allowed for good air circulation. Bookshelf organized by subject and author.

Order.

Quiet.

*Empty*.

Cornelius closed the door behind him and moved to the writing desk. He pulled out his private ledger and opened it to a blank page.

*New Information: Eudora of Naxos hired Elias to steal the Kallistos glaze formula. Payment was fifty silver crescents hidden in the correspondence folder. Elias promised delivery by sunset, Thirdday. He never arrived for the meeting.*

Cornelius's claw traced the words.

So. Not blackmail. Not political leverage.

Industrial espionage.

A tile formula locked in a family vault.

Elias promising to steal it. Taking payment up front. Recruiting a contact who could actually breach the wards.

And then dying before he could complete the delivery.

Which meant either the contact had killed him and taken the formula for themselves, or Elias had died in the vault breach itself and the contact had fled.

Or—

Or Elias had never intended to split the profits. Had planned to cut out his contact and sell the formula to Eudora alone. And the contact had discovered the betrayal and responded with poison.

Cornelius added another line to his notes.

*Possible motive: Elias double-crossing his partner.*

It fit. Elias had gambling debts. Needed money desperately. Eudora was offering enough silver to clear his debt to Mago and leave him with a comfortable surplus.

What if Elias had decided he did not need to share that windfall?

What if he had planned to take the formula and disappear, leaving his contact with nothing?

And what if the contact had learned of the betrayal and taken preemptive action?

Cornelius stared at the page.

It was logical. Internally consistent. Supported by the evidence.

But it was also unfalsifiable without knowing the identity of Elias's contact.

Which brought him back to the same question he had been circling since the beginning.

*Who had the technical knowledge to breach the vault wards?*

Sophia Doukas.

Alexandros Doukas.

Someone else entirely.

Cornelius's claws tapped against the desk.

He needed more information. Needed to verify Sophia's movements during the critical timeframe. Needed to confirm whether Alexandros had access to alchemical materials and vault-breaking expertise.

Needed—

Needed Zeph.

The thought arrived unbidden and unwelcome.

Zeph, who could move through crowds without drawing attention. Who had family connections throughout the merchant district. Who could ask casual questions without triggering the defensive suspicion that a small dragon investigator provoked.

Zeph, who was currently at the Feast square, enjoying music and fried dough and the company of people who were not obsessively cataloging evidence.

Cornelius closed the ledger.

The room felt very quiet suddenly.

Very empty.

He had been alone before. Preferred it, even. Solitude was conducive to focus. To deep thought. To the kind of intellectual work that required freedom from distraction.

But this felt different.

This felt like isolation.

Cornelius stood and moved to the window. From here he could see a sliver of the harbor district. Ships at anchor. The distant movement of dockworkers loading cargo.

Somewhere beyond his line of sight, the Feast continued. Music and laughter and the joyful chaos of a city celebrating spring.

And somewhere in that chaos, Zeph was probably having a good time. Making friends. Being a normal teenager instead of an amateur investigator's reluctant assistant.

Cornelius's wings folded tight against his back.

He should not have snapped. Should not have dismissed Zeph's desire for a break as frivolous. Should not have framed the investigation as more important than Zeph's legitimate need to simply *exist* for a few minutes without the weight of murder and theft and failure pressing down.

He would apologize.

Tomorrow.

After he had made progress. After he had something to show for pushing forward alone.

After he could prove that his obsessive focus was not just pride but professionalism.

Cornelius turned away from the window and returned to the desk.

He opened the ledger again and began writing. Organizing. Cataloging every piece of evidence he had gathered. Every observation. Every deduction.

Building a case that would withstand scrutiny. That would prove beyond doubt who had killed Elias of Tyre and stolen from the Kallistos vault.

Building it alone.

In the quiet.

Where no one could see him fail again.
