# Chapter 15

The tea had gone cold.

Cornelius stared at the cup sitting on Imelda's desk. The mint leaves had settled to the bottom, forming a dark sediment against the white ceramic. The surface was still. Undisturbed.

How long had they been sitting here? An hour? Two?

The Head Librarian had excused herself twenty minutes ago. Something about checking the staff entrance locks and ensuring the Watch patrol had not altered their route. Her office felt larger without her presence. Emptier.

Cornelius sat in the reinforced chair, claws resting on the desk's edge. His throat ached. The bruises from Alexandros's grip had settled into a persistent throb that sharpened whenever he swallowed or turned his head.

Across from him, Zeph was sprawled in the second chair. The boy had his long legs stretched out, heels braced against the floor. His arms were crossed. His expression was the particular kind of frustrated that came from staring at a puzzle with missing pieces.

"Okay," Zeph said. Not for the first time. "So we know Alexandros killed Elias. We know *how* he killed him. Kiln accelerant, magical catalyst, toxic fumes in a sealed vault."

"Correct." Cornelius's voice came out rougher than intended. He cleared his throat carefully. The motion sent another spike of pain through the bruised tissue.

"And we know Eudora hired Elias to steal what she *thought* was a glaze formula, but was actually blackmail letters."

"Yes."

"But Elias lied to her about what he was stealing."

"Apparently."

Zeph's fingers drummed against his bicep. "So who was Elias *really* working for? Like, who wanted the letters?"

Cornelius's tail swished once. A slow, thoughtful motion.

He had been asking himself the same question since Imelda's revelation. The glaze formula had been a fiction. A story Elias sold to Eudora to secure funding. But if Elias had been planning to steal blackmail material all along, he must have had a buyer.

Someone willing to pay for forty years of scandalous correspondence.

Someone with a grudge against House Kallistos or an interest in political leverage.

"The letters themselves are valuable," Cornelius said slowly. "Personal correspondence from the old patriarch would damage the family's reputation. Proof of infidelity. Proof of illegitimate children, perhaps. Depending on the content."

"So Elias steals them and sells them to... who? Someone who hates the Kallistos family?"

"Or someone who brokers in secrets." Cornelius thought of Mago Hanno. The orc smuggler who dealt in more than fireworks and restricted cargo. "Information has value in the harbor district. Leverage can be sold or traded."

Zeph nodded. "Okay. So Elias plans the heist. He gets Eudora to fund it by lying about the glaze formula. He gets Petros drunk and tricks him into writing down the vault code. He hires Alexandros to actually crack the wards and melt the seal."

"And then something went wrong."

"Yeah. But what?"

Cornelius's claws tapped against the desk. A rhythmic pattern. Organizing his thoughts.

The sequence of events. Start from the beginning.

Elias delivers the package to the vault. The package contains Eudora's payment—fifty silver crescents hidden in a correspondence folder.

The wards accept the package because it is addressed to the Kallistos vault. Legitimate. Expected.

The next night, someone breaches the vault.

The iron seal is melted with kiln accelerant and magical fire.

Elias is inside the vault when the accelerant burns. He inhales the fumes. Dies.

His body is found the following morning along with the broken seal and missing correspondence.

Cornelius's wings rustled.

"What?" Zeph leaned forward. "You just twitched."

"The timeline," Cornelius said. His mind was moving faster now. Cataloguing. Cross-referencing. "Elias delivered the package on Secondday. The vault was breached that night or early the next morning. His body was discovered at dawn when I opened the library."

"Right. So?"

"So the breach happened quickly. Within hours of the package delivery." Cornelius's tail coiled. "Why the rush? If Elias had been planning this for weeks—recruiting Alexandros, gathering tools, manipulating Petros—why execute the theft immediately after delivering the payment?"

Zeph frowned. "Maybe he was worried someone would notice the package? Like, get suspicious and check the vault early?"

"Possible. But the package was logged as legitimate correspondence. No one had reason to inspect it." Cornelius's claws flexed. "Unless Elias feared his partnership with Alexandros was unstable."

"You think they were already fighting?"

"I think Elias may have realized he had made a dangerous ally." Cornelius remembered the argument Zeph had witnessed in the market square. Sophia Doukas and Elias. The tension. The mention of wards and sequences and withheld payment.

Sophia Doukas. Alexandros Doukas.

House Doukas.

"Sophia hired Elias," Cornelius said. The pieces were aligning. Clicking into place with the satisfying weight of properly shelved books. "She wanted the Kallistos letters to damage their reputation. To level the tile market by destroying their family's honor."

Zeph's eyes widened. "The handkerchief. With Petros's monogram. You said it smelled like lilac and turpentine."

"Petros and the Doukas workshop. Yes." Cornelius's mind raced ahead. Following the thread. "Sophia seduced Petros or simply cultivated a relationship with him. Close enough to acquire his handkerchief. Close enough to learn about the vault and its contents."

"She used him."

"As Elias used him. Petros was a tool. Drunk. Careless. Easy to manipulate." Cornelius felt a pang of guilt. He had accused Petros publicly. Had treated him as a conspirator when in fact the man had simply been prey for more calculating minds.

Zeph was nodding. Fitting the pieces together. "So Sophia hires Elias. Elias brings in Alexandros because he needs someone who can actually crack the wards and melt the seal. They plan the job together."

"But then Elias grows nervous. Or greedy." Cornelius's tail lashed once. "He has Eudora's fifty silver crescents. He has access to valuable blackmail material. Why share the profit with Alexandros and Sophia when he could take everything for himself?"

"He tried to double-cross them."

"Yes."

The word settled in the small office like a stone dropping into still water.

Elias had planned to betray his partners. Had intended to steal the letters and disappear. Sell them to Mago Hanno or another broker. Keep Eudora's payment *and* the proceeds from the blackmail sale.

But Alexandros had discovered the betrayal.

Had followed Elias to the vault.

Had melted the seal as planned.

And then had killed him.

Not with poison. Not with a blade.

With fire. Alchemical fire that filled the small vault with toxic fumes while Elias was trapped inside.

Cornelius's wings pressed tight against his back.

"That is why Alexandros smelled of burnt almond and ozone when he grabbed me," he said quietly. "He had been handling kiln accelerant recently. Either destroying evidence or—"

He stopped.

His claws went still against the desk.

A new thought. Sharp and cold.

"Or?" Zeph prompted.

"Or he has not yet completed his task." Cornelius's voice was barely above a whisper. His mind was moving very fast now. Racing through implications. "Elias is dead. The vault is breached. The correspondence is missing."

"Right. Alexandros took the letters."

"Did he?"

Zeph blinked. "What do you mean? Of course he did. The vault was empty when you checked it."

"The shelf was empty. Yes." Cornelius's tail began to coil. Slow. Deliberate. "But if Alexandros successfully removed the letters from the building, why did he threaten me in the alley? Why risk drawing attention to himself by assaulting a Curator?"

Zeph opened his mouth. Closed it. "Because... you were investigating?"

"I was asking questions, yes. But I had no proof. No admissible evidence. Captain Melas had already closed the case." Cornelius's claws tapped faster now. The rhythm of thoughts aligning. "Alexandros could have simply ignored me. Let the Watch's ruling stand. Let the Spring Feast end and the city return to normal routine."

"But he didn't."

"No. He intercepted me in an empty alley and made explicit threats. He wanted me to stop investigating. Immediately." Cornelius's wings rustled. "Why?"

Zeph leaned forward. His elbows braced on his knees. "Because he's worried you'll figure something out."

"Yes. But what?" Cornelius's mind turned the question over. Examining it from every angle. "I already know he killed Elias. The scent evidence proves his involvement in the vault breach. But scent is not admissible without corroboration. He has no reason to fear my investigation unless—"

The thought hit him like a physical blow.

Unless the crime was not yet complete.

Unless there was still evidence to find.

Unless—

"The letters are still here," Cornelius said.

The words came out flat. Certain. The kind of certainty that came not from assumption but from the slow, methodical elimination of alternatives.

Zeph stared at him. "What?"

"The Kallistos correspondence. The blackmail material. It never left the library." Cornelius stood. His chair scraped against the floor. His wings spread slightly. An unconscious gesture. The beginning of a hunt. "Alexandros could not remove it."

"But—why not? He killed Elias. He melted the seal. He had access to the vault."

"Access, yes. But not *exit*." Cornelius's claws clicked against the floorboards as he paced. Small, tight circles. His mind was racing now. Cataloguing. Organizing. "The library's wards are not just protective barriers against intrusion. They are *inventory controls*."

Zeph's face screwed up in confusion. "What does that mean?"

"Every item stored in the private vaults is logged. Tagged by the ward structure. The magic recognizes each piece of correspondence, each artifact, each ledger as belonging to a specific family." Cornelius's tail lashed. "The wards will allow authorized deposits and withdrawals. But if someone attempts to remove an item without proper authorization—"

"The wards go off," Zeph finished. His voice was quiet. Awed. "Like an alarm."

"Exactly." Cornelius stopped pacing. Turned to face Zeph fully. "Alexandros melted the physical seal. But the *magical* protections remained active. If he tried to leave the building carrying the Kallistos correspondence, the wards would have registered the theft."

"So he couldn't take the letters with him."

"Not without triggering an immediate response from the Watch. Not without announcing to the entire city that the vault had been compromised." Cornelius's claws flexed. "He killed Elias. Took the correspondence from the shelf. And then realized he was trapped."

Zeph stood. His hands were clenched into fists. "So what did he do?"

"The only thing he could do. He hid them." Cornelius's voice was steady now. The fear from the alley had burned away. What remained was focus. Purpose. The particular clarity that came from solving a puzzle. "Somewhere in this building. Somewhere he could retrieve them later, after the wards were lifted or after he arranged a legitimate reason to access the library."

"But the wards aren't lifted. The library is still sealed."

"Yes. Which means Alexandros cannot retrieve his prize. Cannot complete the theft." Cornelius's wings rustled. "And if I continue investigating—if I begin searching the building systematically—I might find the letters before he can claim them."

"That's why he threatened you." Zeph's voice was tight. Angry. "He needs you to back off until he figures out how to get the letters out."

"Correct."

They stood in Imelda's office. The cold tea. The scattered notes. The lamplight casting long shadows across the worn floorboards.

Cornelius felt the hoard-threat instinct prickling between his scales. Not a warning this time. A *call*. The same sensation he felt when a misshelved book disrupted the catalog. When disorder invaded his sanctuary.

Something that belonged to the library's inventory was hidden. Misplaced. Wrong.

And he was going to find it.

"Where would he hide them?" Zeph asked. He was already moving toward the door. Energy humming through his lanky frame. "The vault is sealed by the Watch. The main floor is locked. Where in this whole building could you stash a bunch of old letters without someone finding them?"

Cornelius's mind cycled through the library's layout. Three floors. Dozens of rooms. Thousands of shelves and alcoves and storage spaces.

But Alexandros had been pressed for time. Had needed to hide the correspondence quickly. Before the library opened. Before Cornelius arrived at dawn and discovered Elias's body.

"Somewhere accessible," Cornelius said. His claws tapped against his thigh. A thinking gesture. "Alexandros entered through the ventilation system. The same route the thieves used. So he exited the same way."

"The south archive grate."

"Yes. Which means he moved through the maintenance corridors. The spaces behind the walls." Cornelius's tail coiled. "Spaces that are not regularly patrolled or inventoried."

Zeph's eyes lit up. "Like the vent shafts themselves."

"Possibly. But the vents are narrow. Difficult to access without tools. And Alexandros is not a small man." Cornelius paced again. Faster now. "He would have needed somewhere close to his exit route. Somewhere he could reach quickly and without attracting attention if he returned during the day."

"The archives?"

"Too public. Too well-trafficked." Cornelius's mind raced through possibilities. Eliminating. Narrowing. "The storage annexes. The bindery. The cleaning closets off the main corridors."

"That's still a lot of places to search."

"Yes. But we have an advantage." Cornelius stopped pacing. Looked at Zeph directly. "Alexandros does not know the library the way I do. He would have hidden the letters somewhere that seemed secure to an outsider. But not somewhere truly hidden to someone who knows every shelf and cupboard."

Zeph grinned. It was sharp. Fierce. The expression of someone ready to hunt. "So we search. Start with the maintenance corridors and work outward."

"We search methodically. Room by room. Shelf by shelf." Cornelius moved toward the door. His wings were half-spread now. The posture of a dragon defending his hoard. "And we do not stop until we find what was stolen."

They left Imelda's office. Moved through the dim corridors toward the library's heart.

The building was silent around them. No patrons. No footsteps. Just the faint creak of old wood settling and the distant murmur of the Spring Feast outside.

Cornelius led the way. His claws clicked softly against stone. His senses were sharp. Focused.

Somewhere in this sanctuary—his hoard, his responsibility—forty years of scandalous correspondence lay hidden.

Letters that had cost Elias his life.

Letters that Alexandros Doukas had killed to possess.

Letters that would prove, once and for all, exactly who had breached the vault and why.

Cornelius's throat ached. His wings trembled with barely suppressed energy.

But his mind was clear.

The puzzle was not yet solved. But the final piece was close.

And he was going to find it.

"Where do we start?" Zeph asked. His voice was quiet. Tense.

Cornelius stopped at the junction where the administrative corridor met the main archive hall. To the left, the reading rooms. To the right, the storage annexes and maintenance access.

He closed his eyes. Let his hoard-sense extend. Searching for the particular wrongness that came from misplaced inventory.

There.

Faint. But present.

A prickle along his spine. A pull toward the eastern wing.

"This way," Cornelius said.

He opened his eyes and started walking.

Behind him, Zeph followed without question.

The hunt had begun.
