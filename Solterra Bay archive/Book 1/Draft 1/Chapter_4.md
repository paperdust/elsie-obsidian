# Chapter 4

The rafters smelled of dust and old wood and failure.

Cornelius lay curled on the broad beam that ran the length of the library's western wall, his tail wrapped around his body, his wings folded tight. Below, the main floor stretched empty and silent. The amber light from the dome cast long shadows across the shelves. The reading tables waited, clean and unused.

No patrons had come today.

Word had spread. *Body in the library. Death in the vault. Not safe.*

Cornelius had heard the whispers from the street when he had unlocked the door that morning. A cluster of women at the fountain, glancing toward the entrance and shaking their heads. A merchant pulling his cart away from the square with a deliberate detour.

The library—*his* library—had been marked as unsafe.

And he could do nothing about it.

*You are a dragon who runs a library.*

Theo's voice echoed in his mind for the hundredth time. Flat. Dismissive. Final.

Not a guardian. Not an investigator. Not even a credible witness.

Just a dragon.

Who ran a library.

Cornelius's claws dug into the wood of the beam. The sound was soft, controlled. He would not scar his own rafters with temper. He would not lose composure simply because the entire city Watch had decided his century of service meant less than a healer's three-minute examination and a captain's need for a tidy report.

He had done everything correctly.

He had observed, documented, presented evidence with clarity and precision. He had identified the melted seal, the chemical residue, the burnt almond scent of cyanide. He had connected the missing package to the theft, noted the rope burns on Elias's hands, traced the ventilation access route.

And he had been dismissed.

Worse—he had been *locked out*.

The vault below was chained shut. His key sat in Theo's pocket. The crime scene was being processed by guards who could not tell lapis dust from lamp oil.

Cornelius closed his eyes and pressed his snout against the beam.

The library was supposed to be his sanctuary. His hoard. The one place in the world where order prevailed and chaos remained outside the door.

But chaos had entered.

It had melted his wards, stolen his contents, left a body on his floor.

And when he had tried to respond—when he had tried to *protect*—he had been told to step aside.

Useless.

He was useless.

The thought settled over him like cold stone.

Footsteps sounded on the main floor. Light. Familiar.

"Cornelius?" Zeph's voice drifted up from below. "You still up there?"

Cornelius did not answer.

The footsteps moved toward the spiral stair that led to the rafter access platform. The boy was coming up.

Of course he was.

Zeph did not understand the concept of *leaving someone alone*.

The stairs creaked. A moment later, Zeph's head appeared at the platform edge, his dark hair catching the amber light. He spotted Cornelius and climbed the rest of the way, stepping carefully onto the beam walk.

"Hey," Zeph said. He carried something wrapped in cloth. "Brought you something."

Cornelius opened one eye. "I am not hungry."

"It's not food." Zeph crouched on the beam with the balance of someone who had clearly done this before without permission. He unwrapped the cloth.

Fresh mint. A full bundle, bright green and fragrant.

The scent reached Cornelius immediately—clean, sharp, soothing. Nothing like ozone. Nothing like burnt almonds.

Just mint.

Cornelius lifted his head slightly. "Where did you get that?"

"The herb seller. The one from the Feast market." Zeph set the bundle on the beam between them. "I remembered you liked this kind. The, uh... the curly-leaf one."

"Spearmint," Cornelius corrected automatically. He stared at the bundle. It was a generous amount. Expensive, especially during the Feast when prices doubled. "You purchased this?"

"Yeah." Zeph shrugged, looking away. "Figured you could use it. You know. After... everything."

Cornelius sat up slowly. His tail unwound. His wings shifted, settling into a more comfortable position.

Zeph had bought him mint.

With his own money.

As a... what? An apology? A gesture of solidarity?

A peace offering.

Cornelius reached out and pulled a sprig free from the bundle. He chewed it slowly, letting the flavor settle over his tongue. The sharpness cleared his head. The coolness eased the tightness in his chest.

"Thank you," he said quietly.

Zeph blinked. "Uh. You're welcome?"

They sat in silence for a moment. Below, the library remained still. The shelves stood like sentinels. The vault door—chained and locked—was just visible from this angle, a dark iron wound in the western wall.

"This sucks," Zeph said finally.

Cornelius huffed. "That is an understatement."

"Yeah, well." Zeph picked at the edge of the beam. "I don't have fancy words for it. This just... sucks. You were right. About everything. And they didn't listen."

"No. They did not."

"So what do we do?"

Cornelius glanced at him. "We?"

"Yeah. We." Zeph met his eyes. "You think I'm just gonna go back to shelving books while some murderer walks around free? After they killed a guy in *our* library?"

*Our* library.

The boy had said *our*.

Cornelius looked away, chewing another sprig of mint. His chest felt strange. Tight, but not unpleasantly so.

"I do not know what we do," he admitted. The words came out softer than he intended. "I have documented the evidence. I have filed a formal protest. I have done everything within my authority. And it was not enough."

"Because Theo's an idiot."

"Because I am a dragon who runs a library." Cornelius's claws scraped the wood. "Not a Watch investigator. Not a legal authority. I have no standing. No jurisdiction. No power to compel action."

"That's bureaucratic garbage," Zeph said flatly.

"Perhaps. But it is also reality." Cornelius's tail curled around his feet. "I thought... I believed that evidence and logic would be sufficient. That clarity of observation would matter. But it does not. Not when set against institutional convenience."

"So they're just gonna let it go? Call it natural causes and move on?"

"It would appear so."

"That's—" Zeph stopped. His hands curled into fists. "That's not fair."

"No. It is not."

They sat together on the beam, the bundle of mint between them, and stared down at the library floor.

Cornelius had not expected to feel this. This sense of... companionship. Shared frustration. The boy was sixteen, irreverent, chronically messy, and prone to smuggling pastries into sacred spaces.

But he was here.

And he cared.

"I was scared," Zeph said suddenly. His voice was small. "When you told me about the body. I was really scared."

Cornelius turned to look at him.

Zeph was staring at his hands. "I kept thinking... what if the killer was still here? What if they came back? What if—" He stopped. Swallowed. "I didn't want you to know. Because you're always so... sure. About everything. And I didn't want to look like a coward."

"Fear is not cowardice," Cornelius said. "Fear is rational assessment of danger. You were correct to be frightened. Someone committed murder in this building. That is objectively terrifying."

"Yeah, but you weren't scared."

"I was." The admission surprised Cornelius even as he said it. But it was true. "I *am*. Not of physical harm. But of... failing to protect this place. Of being powerless to stop what has already begun." He looked down at the vault door. "I have spent a century building this sanctuary. And in one night, someone violated it. And I could not stop them."

Zeph was quiet for a long moment.

Then he said, "You didn't fail."

"I did not succeed."

"You *noticed*." Zeph's voice was firm. "You saw all the stuff Theo missed. You figured out the poison, the melted seal, the missing package. You connected the dots. That's not failing. That's... that's being smart."

"Intelligence without authority is merely observation." Cornelius pulled another sprig of mint from the bundle. "I can see the crime. I simply cannot solve it."

"Not alone, maybe." Zeph shifted on the beam. "But you've got me. And we've got all your notes. And the library's still here. So... I don't know. Maybe we just keep looking. Keep watching. Until we find something Theo *can't* ignore."

Cornelius considered this.

The boy was not wrong.

He had evidence. He had observations. He had a detailed incident log documenting every suspicious detail from Elias's arrival to Photine's questionable ruling.

And he had a sixteen-year-old intern who apparently considered himself part of an investigative team.

It was not much.

But it was more than he'd had an hour ago.

"Very well," Cornelius said. He sat up straighter, adjusting his spectacles. "We will proceed independently. Quietly. We will observe, document, and wait for the conspirators to make a mistake."

"Yeah?" Zeph's face brightened. "We're doing this?"

"We are doing *something*." Cornelius folded his wings. "Though I am not yet certain what."

A sound echoed from below. A knock. Sharp and impatient.

Not the front door.

The rear delivery entrance.

Cornelius and Zeph looked at each other.

"You expecting a delivery?" Zeph asked.

"No." Cornelius rose to his feet and moved along the beam toward the access platform. "The library is closed. No one should be using that entrance."

The knock came again. Louder.

Cornelius descended the spiral stair with Zeph close behind. They crossed the main floor and moved through the staff corridor toward the back of the building.

The delivery entrance was a small, iron-banded door set into the western wall. It opened onto a narrow alley used by couriers and suppliers. Cornelius had reinforced the lock himself three years ago.

He approached the door and called through it. "The library is closed. Return tomorrow during operating hours."

"I am not here for the library." The voice was female. Older. Sharp-edged with impatience. "I am here for my package. Eudora of Naxos. I sent correspondence for the Kallistos vault two days ago. I need it back."

Cornelius stopped.

Eudora of Naxos.

The name on the intake form. The sender of the package Elias had delivered.

The package that was now missing.

He glanced at Zeph. The boy's eyes were wide.

Cornelius unlocked the door and opened it just wide enough to see out.

A woman stood in the alley. She was human, perhaps sixty, with gray hair pinned severely back and the kind of posture that suggested a lifetime of giving orders. Her dress was fine linen, dyed deep red. Her hands were bare, and her fingers bore ink stains.

A clerk. Or a merchant. Someone who worked with ledgers.

"Curator." She inclined her head in a perfunctory nod. "I sent a package via courier. Elias of Tyre. It was to be stored in the Kallistos vault for retrieval during the Feast. I require it now."

Cornelius studied her. No grief in her expression. No concern. Just irritation at the inconvenience.

"You hired Elias to deliver the package?" he asked.

"Yes. Through the courier's guild. Standard contract." Eudora's eyes narrowed. "Why? Is there a problem?"

"Elias of Tyre is dead."

The words landed flat and cold in the alley.

Eudora went still. Her expression did not change. "Dead."

"Yes. He was found in the Kallistos vault yesterday morning. The Watch has ruled it natural causes, though the circumstances remain under investigation."

"I see." Eudora's gaze flicked past Cornelius toward the interior of the library, as though she could see through the walls to the vault itself. "And my package?"

Cornelius stared at her.

A man had died.

A courier she had hired.

And her first question—her *only* question—was about her package.

"The package is missing," he said. "It was stolen during the breach of the vault."

"Stolen." Eudora's face tightened. "You allowed it to be stolen."

"I allowed nothing. The vault was breached by unknown parties using sophisticated magical tools. The contents were taken. The Watch has sealed the vault as a crime scene."

"Then you will need to retrieve my property from the Watch." Eudora's voice was ice. "I paid the storage fee. I contracted the courier. The library's failure to secure my goods is not my concern."

Behind Cornelius, Zeph made a small, incredulous sound.

Cornelius's claws dug into the door frame. "A man is *dead*."

"Yes. You mentioned that." Eudora pulled a folded parchment from her belt pouch and held it out. "Here is my receipt. I expect compensation for the lost package, or its immediate return, whichever is faster. You may send word to my office in the north quarter when the matter is resolved."

She turned to leave.

Cornelius stepped through the doorway. "What was in the package?"

Eudora stopped. She did not turn around. "That is private."

"A crime has been committed. A theft and a death. The contents of your package may be material evidence."

"Then the Watch may ask me." Eudora glanced back over her shoulder. "I do not answer to librarians."

She walked toward the mouth of the alley.

And stopped.

A figure stepped into view, blocking her path.

Alexandros Doukas.

Cornelius recognized him immediately. Tall, broad-shouldered, with the kind of controlled stillness that spoke of physical confidence. He wore a dark blue tunic embroidered with the spiral pattern of House Doukas. His hair was black, shot through with silver. His face was handsome in a cold, precise way.

And his hands were covered.

Heavy leather gloves. Despite the warmth of the evening.

"Eudora." Alexandros's voice was smooth. Solicitous. "I heard you were inquiring about storage arrangements. May I be of assistance?"

Eudora's expression shifted. The ice melted slightly, replaced by something almost like relief. "Alexandros. Yes. There has been... an incident. My package was stolen from the Kallistos vault."

"How unfortunate." Alexandros moved toward her with the fluid grace of someone used to command. "You must be quite distressed. Please. Allow me to escort you home. We can discuss the matter privately."

"I need to recover my property."

"Of course. And I will help you do so." Alexandros placed one gloved hand on her shoulder. The gesture was gentle. Paternal. "But the library is in disarray at present. The Watch is involved. It would be best to let the officials handle the matter and pursue restitution through proper channels."

He was steering her. Physically turning her away from the library. Away from Cornelius.

"I just want my package," Eudora said. Her voice had lost its edge. She sounded tired. Uncertain.

"I know." Alexandros guided her toward the alley mouth. "Come. Let us speak somewhere more comfortable."

They walked away together, Alexandros's gloved hand still resting on Eudora's shoulder.

Cornelius watched them go.

The gloves.

Heavy leather. Fitted. Not work gloves. Not riding gloves.

Gloves worn to hide something.

Scars. Burns. Stains.

Or the residue of alchemical work.

Alexandros glanced back just before they turned the corner. His gaze met Cornelius's. For one brief moment, something cold and sharp flickered in his expression.

Then he smiled. Polite. Empty.

And they were gone.

Cornelius stood in the alley for a long moment, the receipt still in his claw.

Behind him, Zeph let out a breath. "Okay. That was weird."

"Yes."

"She didn't even care that Elias was dead."

"No. She did not."

"And Alexandros just... showed up. Like he was waiting." Zeph moved to stand beside Cornelius, staring at the empty alley. "That's suspicious, right? That's not just me?"

"It is not just you." Cornelius turned the receipt over in his claws. The handwriting was precise. The wax seal bore the mark of a Naxos merchant house. Legitimate, on the surface.

But the reaction had been wrong.

Grief, shock, fear—those were normal responses to the news of a hired courier's death.

Eudora had shown none of them.

She had shown only frustration at an inconvenience.

And Alexandros had appeared at exactly the right moment to intercept her. To control the conversation. To steer her away before Cornelius could ask further questions.

Wearing gloves that hid his hands.

Cornelius folded the receipt and slipped it into his pouch.

"We are adding Eudora of Naxos to the list," he said.

"List of what?"

"Suspects. Witnesses. Individuals who bear further observation." Cornelius turned back toward the library. "She hired Elias. She sent the package. And her response to his death was concern for her property, not the man."

"You think she's involved?"

"I think she knows more than she is saying." Cornelius locked the delivery door behind them and moved back through the corridor. "And I think Alexandros Doukas did not want her saying it to me."

They returned to the main floor. The amber light from the dome had deepened, casting long shadows across the shelves. The library felt larger in the quiet. Emptier.

But not abandoned.

Zeph was still here. The mint was still fresh. The ledger was still waiting.

And Cornelius was no longer sitting uselessly in the rafters.

He moved to his desk and pulled out his private incident log.

*Spring Feast, Day Two. Evening.*

*Visitor: Eudora of Naxos. Sender of the stolen package. Claims it contained private correspondence. Showed no grief or concern for Elias's death. Primary concern: recovery of property.*

*Observation: Alexandros Doukas intercepted her in the alley. Wore heavy gloves despite warm evening. Steered conversation away from the library and further inquiry.*

*Hypothesis: Eudora may be connected to the theft. Alexandros may be protecting her—or protecting someone else's interests.*

*Conclusion: Surveillance of House Doukas is warranted.*

He set down his pen.

Zeph leaned over his shoulder, reading. "You really think Alexandros is part of this?"

"I think he is connected." Cornelius tapped the page. "His sister Sophia was seen arguing with Elias the day before the theft. A blue thread matching her dress was found on Sister Photine's sandal. And now Alexandros appears precisely when Eudora attempts to reclaim stolen property."

"That's... a lot of Doukas."

"Yes. It is." Cornelius closed the ledger. "Which suggests either a family conspiracy or a very unfortunate series of coincidences."

"You don't believe in coincidences."

"No. I do not."

Cornelius looked toward the chained vault door. The iron links gleamed dully in the amber light. The lock hung heavy and final.

Theo had the key. The Watch controlled the scene. The official investigation had been closed with a ruling of natural causes.

But Cornelius had his own investigation now.

Quiet. Methodical. Built on observation and documentation.

And he was no longer conducting it alone.

He glanced at Zeph. The boy was staring at the vault with the same expression Cornelius imagined he himself wore—determination mixed with lingering fear.

"We will need to be careful," Cornelius said.

"Yeah. I figured."

"If the conspirators realize we are investigating, we become targets."

"I know."

"You may withdraw from this endeavor at any time. I will not think less of you."

Zeph looked at him. "You're not getting rid of me that easy."

Cornelius felt something in his chest shift. Warm. Unfamiliar.

Not unpleasant.

"Very well," he said. "Then we proceed together."

The library settled into evening quiet around them. The shelves stood witness. The books waited, patient and still.

And somewhere in the city beyond, a killer walked free.

But Cornelius was watching now.

And he would not stop until the truth was written in ink, documented in ledgers, and impossible to ignore.

Even if he had to build the case one careful observation at a time.
