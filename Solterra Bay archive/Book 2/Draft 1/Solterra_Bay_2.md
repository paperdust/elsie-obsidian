"Seventeen," Cornelius muttered, adjusting his spectacles with one bronze claw. "Eighteen. Nineteen."

The books stood in their proper formation along the shelf, spines aligned with mathematical precision. He tilted his head, peering through the gold-rimmed lenses at the embossed titles. Each volume was exactly where it belonged, sorted by author, then subject, then acquisition date. The system was flawless. The system was *his*.

He extended one wing for balance and reached for the twentieth spine. His talons closed around the leather binding with the careful grip of long practice. One advantage of being a Library Dragon rather than the traditional gold-hoarding variety: books did not require the same delicate touch as ancient coins. They were sturdy. Reliable. They stayed where one put them.

"Twenty," he said, and made a neat tick mark in his ledger.

The afternoon inventory proceeded exactly as it should. The Festival of Twinkle Nights roared somewhere beyond the library's thick stone walls—a cacophony of drums, flutes, and entirely too many humans shouting about beetle migrations—but here, in the cool dimness of the Reference Collection, order prevailed. Dust motes hung motionless in the air. The marble floor gleamed, recently polished. Every shelf label faced outward at the regulation angle.

Cornelius permitted himself a small curl of satisfaction in his chest, the draconic equivalent of a purr. This was as it should be. This was *correct*.

He moved to the next shelf and began again. "One. Two. Three."

The library had been his life's work for the better part of a century. Other dragons hoarded gold, or gems, or the bones of their enemies. Cornelius had always found such pursuits tedious. Gold simply sat there, glittering stupidly. It did not organize itself. It did not require cataloging, or preservation, or careful climate control. It was, in his professional opinion, terribly boring.

But books. Books were a hoard worthy of intelligence.

"Four. Five. Six."

The Collection of Botanical Texts occupied the third tier of shelving in the western gallery, accessible only by ladder or flight. Cornelius preferred flight. Ladders were designed for beings with legs of equal length, and his hind legs were notably shorter than his forelegs. The resulting wobble was simply unacceptable.

He spread his wings and glided up to the seventh shelf with barely a whisper of displaced air. His claws clicked softly against the stone ledge as he landed. Excellent. Shelf Seven, Row B: Agricultural Practices and Permaculture. Twelve volumes, if memory served.

"One. Two. Three. Four."

A door slammed somewhere in the depths of the building. Cornelius's ear-frills twitched in irritation. That would be the Intern, returning from his lunch break. Late, no doubt. The boy had been increasingly distracted this week, forever smoothing his hair or checking his reflection in the brass door plates. It was deeply inefficient.

Footsteps echoed up from the main hall—rapid, uneven, and accompanied by the unmistakable sound of someone eating something flaky. Cornelius closed his eyes and counted silently to ten. He would not lose his temper. He would not incinerate the phyllo pastry. He would maintain his composure and simply remind the boy, yet again, that food was not permitted within five meters of the archival materials.

"Five. Six. Seven."

"Hey, Boss!"

Cornelius's talons clenched reflexively around the spine of *Agricultural Wisdom of the Northern Plains*. He took a slow breath and turned his head to peer down at the main floor. 

The Intern stood at the base of the ladder, one hand cupped beneath a spanakopita that was shedding its outer layers with the enthusiasm of a molting griffin. Phyllo flakes drifted downward in a lazy spiral, glinting as they fell. Three of them landed on the polished marble. One landed on the circulation desk. Another appeared to be lodged in the boy's hair.

"Zephyr," Cornelius said, keeping his voice perfectly level. "If a single crumb of that monstrosity touches the First Edition Compendium, I shall feel compelled to file you under Hazardous Waste."

Zeph looked down at his pastry, then at the crumbs, then back up at Cornelius. His expression suggested he had only just now considered the possibility that food might shed. "Uh. Want me to—"

"Eat. Outside."

"But I just—"

"*Outside*."

The boy's shoulders slumped. He turned and slouched toward the door, trailing phyllo like a particularly inefficient refugee from a bakery explosion. Cornelius waited until the door clicked shut before returning to his count.

"Seven," he repeated. "Eight. Nine."

The interruption had disrupted his rhythm. He paused, closed his eyes, and reconstructed the mental image of the shelf. Row B. Agricultural Practices. He had counted nine, which meant three remained. He opened his eyes and continued.

"Ten. Eleven."

His claw reached for the twelfth volume.

The space was empty.

Cornelius blinked. He adjusted his spectacles. The space remained empty.

He leaned closer, bringing his snout within an inch of the gap. The dust pattern on the shelf showed a clear rectangular outline where a book had rested for years. The volumes on either side leaned inward slightly, as though their missing neighbor had only recently departed. He sniffed cautiously. No scent of mold or decay. The book had not crumbled. It had been removed.

A cold prickle of wrongness ran down his spine.

Books did not simply vanish. Not in his library. Not under his watch.

He pulled back and consulted his ledger, flipping to the inventory master list with quick, precise movements. His claw traced down the entries for Shelf Seven, Row B.

*Position Twelve: "Secret Wonders: Field notes on medicinal herbs of the coastal regions," Author: Anonymous. Leather binding, brown. Acquired Year 384. Last verified: Spring Inventory, Day Fifteen.*

His eyes narrowed. Spring Inventory had been six weeks ago. The book had been *here*. He distinctly remembered checking it. He remembered the scuffed corner of the binding and the faint water stain on the bottom edge. He remembered everything about his hoard.

And now it was gone.

Cornelius descended from the shelf in a controlled glide, landing on the circulation desk with barely a sound. His mind spun through possibilities. Mis-shelved? Unlikely. He had personally organized this section. Borrowed and not returned? Impossible. He tracked every loan with obsessive precision. Stolen?

His chest went cold.

No. Not stolen. That was absurd. Who would steal a book from *his* library? Everyone knew that crossing a Library Dragon was an excellent way to spend the rest of one's natural life banned from all written materials within a fifty-mile radius. He had a reputation. He had *standards*.

The book had to be somewhere. Mis-filed, perhaps, by the Intern during one of his rare attempts at helpfulness. The boy meant well, but his organizational skills were catastrophically human.

The front door opened. Zeph returned, pointedly empty-handed, and made a show of brushing crumbs off his tunic. "All clean, Boss. Can I come back in now, or do I need to pass a phyllo inspection?"

Cornelius ignored the sarcasm. "Zephyr. The volume *Secret Wonders*. Brown leather, botanical field notes. Have you re-shelved it recently?"

The boy blinked. "Uh. Which one is that?"

"Shelf Seven, Row B, Position Twelve."

"Man, I don't know the position numbers. You know I don't know the position numbers." Zeph wandered over to the returns cart and poked at the stack of books waiting to be processed. "What's it look like?"

"Brown. Leather. Approximately twenty centimeters tall. Water stain on the bottom edge."

"Doesn't ring a bell." Zeph picked up a book from the cart, squinted at it, then set it down in a slightly different position. Cornelius felt his left eye twitch. "Is it important?"

"Every book in this collection is important."

"Yeah, but like, *important* important? Or just regular important?"

Cornelius opened his mouth to deliver a lecture on the equal value of all knowledge, then stopped. The boy was watching him with an odd expression—half curious, half distracted. There was a faint bronze sheen to his dark hair where it caught the light from the reading lamps. Lamassu ancestry, if Cornelius's memory of bloodlines served. The boy probably didn't even know. Most mixed-heritage humans didn't, these days.

And at this particular moment, the boy clearly did not care about missing books.

"Regular important," Cornelius said finally. "Return to your shelving duties."

Zeph nodded and turned back to the cart. Then he paused. His hand went to his hair, smoothing it down. His reflection appeared faintly in the polished brass of the nearest lamp fixture. He adjusted his collar.

Cornelius's eyes narrowed. "What are you doing?"

"Nothing."

"You are preening."

"I'm not—" Zeph's hand dropped. "I'm just, you know. Making sure I look okay."

"For the books?"

"For—" The boy's face flushed. "Never mind."

Ah. Of course. The date. Zeph had mentioned it approximately forty-seven times over the past three days. He was meeting Sophia Doukas, the tile artist's daughter, at the Festival tonight. Cornelius had listened to detailed descriptions of her eyes (brown), her smile (nice), and her skills with decorative glazework (apparently adequate). The boy was besotted.

And therefore useless for serious investigative work.

Cornelius measured his options. He could demand a full inventory of all recent patron activity. He could interview the cleaning staff. He could check the loan records going back six months.

Or he could do all of that tomorrow, after the wretched Festival ended and the town returned to a reasonable volume level.

The missing book bothered him. It bothered him deeply. But calling in Captain Theo and the Town Watch would mean opening the library to a full search. It would mean disrupting the careful order of the stacks. It would mean explaining to Theo—who had never forgiven him for the incident with the overdue municipal charter—that he had somehow *lost track* of one of his books.

The humiliation alone was unthinkable.

No. Better to wait. The book would turn up. It had to. Books did not simply cease to exist.

Cornelius picked up his ledger and made a careful notation: *Secret Wonders - Position Twelve - Status: MISPLACED. Follow up required.*

He underlined "MISPLACED" twice. Not stolen. Not missing. Misplaced.

The distinction mattered.

"Zephyr," he said, closing the ledger with a decisive snap. "I am going to complete the inventory of the Historical Documents section. You will continue processing returns. Do try not to destroy anything."

"Sure thing, Boss." Zeph was back to fussing with his hair. He had produced a small comb from somewhere and was attempting to tame a cowlick. "Hey, uh. Do you think this shirt is okay? Or should I change before I go?"

Cornelius looked at the shirt. It was blue. It had sleeves. It appeared to be free of phyllo.

"It is acceptable."

"Just acceptable?"

"It is a shirt, Zephyr. It performs its function adequately. I fail to see what more one could ask of it."

The boy sighed. "You're no help."

"I am a librarian, not a fashion consultant." Cornelius spread his wings and lifted off, gliding toward the Historical Documents alcove. Behind him, he heard Zeph mutter something that sounded suspiciously like "Yeah, no kidding."

He let it pass. The boy was nervous about his date. Nervous humans said inadvisable things. It was simply their nature.

The Historical Documents section occupied a climate-controlled alcove behind the main stacks. Cornelius had installed the enchantments himself—humidity regulation, pest wards, and a subtle preservation spell that kept the ink from fading. The oldest documents dated back four hundred years, to the founding of Solterra Bay itself. They were priceless. Irreplaceable.

And, he confirmed after a careful count, all present and accounted for.

"Forty-eight," he murmured, making the final tick mark. "Complete."

The relief was immediate. Whatever had happened to *Secret Wonders*, it was an isolated incident. Not an invasion. Not a systematic theft. Just one book, temporarily misplaced.

He could live with that.

For now.

Cornelius glided back to his office—a small room behind the circulation desk, cluttered with the comfortable debris of scholarship. His favorite reading chair sat in the corner, worn smooth by decades of use. His desk occupied the center of the room, covered in neat stacks of correspondence, acquisition requests, and catalog updates. And on the shelf above the desk, his personal collection gleamed: rare first editions, signed manuscripts, and one extremely illegal copy of *The Compleat Anatomy of Civic Government* that he had won in a card game.

He settled into his chair and reached for the teapot. Still warm. He poured himself a cup of mint tea, breathing in the sharp, clean scent.

Outside, the Festival grew louder. Drums thundered. Someone was singing off-key. Children shrieked with what he could only assume was delight. The entire town had lost its collective mind over a swarm of bioluminescent beetles that happened to migrate through the bay once a year. It was, in Cornelius's opinion, an excessive reaction to a minor entomological phenomenon.

But it kept the chaos *outside*, where it belonged.

He sipped his tea and opened the latest acquisition catalog. Three new collections had become available this month. One was promising—a set of natural philosophy texts from the University of Khariton. The other two were overpriced nonsense. He made notes in the margins with his smallest claw, marking items of interest.

Peaceful. Orderly. Exactly as an afternoon should be.

The door to the library rattled.

Cornelius looked up, ear-frills pricking forward. The rattling continued—not the gentle push of a patron trying the handle, but a frantic, uneven banging.

He set down his teacup.

The banging intensified. Someone was pounding on the door with both fists, hard enough that the frame shook. Between impacts, he heard a voice—female, breathless, and rising toward panic.

"Please! Is anyone there? *Please!*"

Zeph appeared in the doorway of the office, eyes wide. "Should I—"

"Yes." Cornelius was already moving, launching himself from the chair and gliding toward the main hall. "Open it."

The boy ran ahead and threw the bolt. The door swung inward.

A woman stumbled through, wild-eyed and gasping. Her gray hair had escaped its pins and hung in tangled wisps around her face. Her traveling cloak was askew, the hem dark with something that might have been mud or worse. She clutched at the doorframe, fighting for breath.

"The library," she panted. "Is this—I need—oh thank the gods."

Cornelius landed on the circulation desk and drew himself up to his full height. Which was, admittedly, not particularly impressive—he was roughly the size of a large cat—but he had learned that posture and authority could compensate for physical stature.

"Madam," he said crisply. "The library is closed for inventory. If you require—"

"No!" She lurched forward, reaching out as though to grab him, then seemed to remember herself. "No, please, you don't understand. I need your help. Someone has—they've taken—I don't know what to do."

Her voice cracked on the last word. Cornelius saw, with some alarm, that her hands were shaking.

Zeph stepped forward. "Hey, it's okay. Just take a breath. What happened?"

But Cornelius had already identified the woman. The silver hair, the ink-stained fingers, the leather satchel embroidered with botanical diagrams. He had seen her portrait in the University press, years ago, when she published her groundbreaking work on cliff-dwelling flora.

"Dr. Floros," he said.

She looked up at him, eyes bright with unshed tears. "You know me?"

"I know your work. *The Hidden Gardens of the Coastal Reach*. An excellent monograph." He paused. "You are a friend of Imelda's."

"Yes." She gripped the edge of the desk as though it were the only solid thing in the world. "Yes. Imelda Kassiani. She said—she told me if I ever needed help in Solterra Bay, I should come here. To the library. To you."

Cornelius felt something cold settle in his stomach. Imelda did not give that advice lightly. She was the Head Librarian, his colleague and—though he would never say it aloud—his closest friend. If she had sent someone to him, it was serious.

"Very well," he said. "Zephyr, fetch her a chair. And water. Dr. Floros, please sit."

She shook her head violently. "There's no time. It's gone. Someone's taken it, and if I don't get it back—" Her voice rose. "The Orchid blooms in three days. Three days! And without the journal, I can't—"

"Dr. Floros." Cornelius let a thread of command enter his voice. Not unkind, but firm. "Sit. Breathe. Then tell me, slowly and clearly, exactly what has been taken."

She stared at him. Then, slowly, she sank into the chair Zeph had pulled forward. The boy offered her a cup of water. She took it with trembling hands and drank.

When she spoke again, her voice was steadier. But the fear remained.

"My field journal," she said. "Someone has stolen my field journal."

Cornelius went very still.

"And in that journal," she continued, "is the only map to the Moon-Scented Orchid. The bloom happens once every fifty years. If I can't document it—if someone else finds it first—"

She didn't finish. She didn't need to.

Cornelius's mind was already racing, categorizing, analyzing. A theft. In his town. During the chaos of the Festival. A valuable document, containing irreplaceable data.

Someone had stolen a book.

His book sense tingled with outrage. His organizational instincts screamed for order to be restored. And beneath both, something else stirred—something predatory and sharp.

He had a case.

"Tell me everything," he said.

# Chapter 2

Dr. Floros gripped the cup of water with both hands, knuckles pale against the ceramic. A drop splashed onto her sleeve. She did not seem to notice.

Cornelius adjusted his spectacles and settled into a more comfortable position on the circulation desk, tail curled neatly around his haunches. He had asked her to tell him everything. Now he would listen, catalog, and determine whether this constituted an actual emergency or simply the sort of scholarly panic that erupted when humans misplaced their notes.

He suspected the latter. Dr. Floros had an excellent reputation for fieldwork, but her monograph on coastal flora had included three separate appendices correcting earlier chapters. The woman was brilliant but disorganized. The muddy hem of her cloak and the wild tangle of her hair suggested she had not improved with age.

"Start at the beginning," he said. "When did you last see the journal?"

"This morning." She set the cup down with a trembling hand. "I was reviewing my field notes at the Sea View Guest House. I had the journal on the writing desk. All my observations, all my maps—fifty years of research, consolidated and cross-referenced." Her voice cracked. "I went down to breakfast at eight bells. When I returned, the window was open and the journal was gone."

Cornelius's ear-frills pricked forward. "The window was closed when you left?"

"Yes. Latched. I'm certain of it."

"What floor?"

"Second."

He considered this. The Sea View Guest House backed onto a network of narrow service alleys. A reasonably fit human could scale to a second-floor window without much difficulty, particularly during Festival chaos when half the town was drunk on honey wine and the other half was attempting to herd bioluminescent beetles.

"Did you see anyone in the corridor? Hear anything unusual?"

"No. Nothing." Dr. Floros leaned forward. "But the journal is extremely valuable, Master Drake. Not just to me. The Moon-Scented Orchid blooms once every fifty years. *Once*. And it blooms for only three days before the petals close and the plant goes dormant again. If I cannot locate it—if someone else finds it first—"

"Yes, you mentioned." Cornelius kept his tone level. "The Orchid. Three days. I understand the urgency."

Though privately, he found the entire situation deeply inefficient. Why would anyone consolidate fifty years of irreplaceable research into a single physical journal? Any competent scholar would maintain duplicate records. Preferably in triplicate, stored in separate locations, with a master index cross-referencing all entries by subject, date, and geographical coordinates.

But he did not say this aloud. Dr. Floros looked approximately two minutes away from complete breakdown, and hysterical humans were notably difficult to interview.

"Describe the journal," he said instead. "Size, color, distinguishing features."

She blinked, as though surprised by the practicality of the question. "Leather-bound. Brown. Approximately this large." She held her hands apart to indicate a book perhaps twenty centimeters tall and fifteen wide. "The cover has a pressed flower design—a four-petaled blossom, gilded. The pages are handmade linen paper. My name is embossed on the inside cover in silver ink."

Cornelius went very still.

Twenty centimeters tall. Brown leather. 

Exactly the size and color of *Secret Wonders: Field notes on medicinal herbs of the coastal regions*.

The missing book from Shelf Seven, Row B, Position Twelve.

A cold, prickling sensation crawled down his spine. He forced himself to remain outwardly calm, tail still, wings folded. Two missing botanical texts. Both brown leather. Both containing field research on rare plants. Both vanishing during the chaos of the Festival.

That was not coincidence. That was pattern.

"When did you arrive in Solterra Bay?" he asked.

"Two days ago. I needed to resupply before the expedition into the highlands. The Orchid grows in a very specific microclimate—limestone cliffs with southern exposure, within audible range of the sea, sheltered from the prevailing winds..." She trailed off, shaking her head. "But that doesn't matter now. Without the map, I'll never find it in time. The highlands are vast. I could search for weeks and never—"

"Dr. Floros." Cornelius let a thread of command enter his voice. "Focus, please. Have you told anyone else about the theft?"

"I went to the Town Watch first. That dreadful man—Captain Theo—he barely listened. Said half the town reports something stolen during Festival, and most of it turns up in a tavern the next morning. He told me to come back tomorrow if it didn't 'magically reappear.'" Her hands clenched into fists. "As though my life's work is equivalent to a misplaced coin purse."

Cornelius felt a sharp flicker of indignation on her behalf. Typical Theo. The man had all the intellectual curiosity of a brick and the investigative instincts to match. No wonder he had never solved the mystery of the overdue municipal charter. He had probably filed it under "Misplaced" and moved on.

Not that Cornelius had done anything different with *Secret Wonders*.

He pushed the thought aside.

"So you came here," he said. "On Imelda's recommendation."

"Yes." Dr. Floros looked up at him, and for the first time, something other than panic showed in her eyes. "She said you were the most meticulous mind she had ever encountered. That if anyone could find a missing book, it was you." She hesitated. "She also said you were insufferably pedantic and would probably lecture me about proper archival practices."

Despite himself, Cornelius felt his spine straighten slightly. "Imelda is an excellent judge of character."

Behind him, Zeph made a strangled sound that might have been a suppressed laugh. Cornelius ignored him.

"Very well," he said. "I will take your case. But I require complete honesty and cooperation. No omissions. No assumptions. You will tell me everything you know, everything you saw, and everything you did today, in precise chronological order."

Dr. Floros nodded so hard her hair came loose from another pin. "Yes. Of course. Anything."

Cornelius flicked his tail in satisfaction. This was better. Order could be imposed on chaos, as long as one had accurate data.

"Begin with your morning routine," he said. "You woke at what time?"

"Seven bells. I ate breakfast in my room—tea and bread. I worked on my notes until—"

A scent cut through her words.

Cornelius's nostrils flared. It was faint, clinging to Dr. Floros's cloak and skin beneath the more obvious smells of road dust and fear-sweat. Sharp. Chemical. Artificial.

Synthetic musk.

He knew that smell. He had encountered it before, in books returned by patrons who shopped at the expensive perfumeries near the harbor. It was the olfactory equivalent of wearing a sign that read "I Have Disposable Income."

Dr. Floros did not strike him as the perfume type. She wore practical traveling clothes, sturdy boots, and no jewelry except a single wooden pendant carved in the shape of an oak leaf. Nothing about her suggested she dabbled in expensive fragrances.

So where had the scent come from?

Cornelius opened his mouth to ask, then stopped.

Dr. Floros was still talking, describing her breakfast in earnest detail. Zeph had fetched her a second cup of water and was hovering nearby with the awkward concern of someone who did not quite know what to do with a distressed middle-aged woman. The library was quiet except for the distant thrum of Festival drums.

And the scent was faint. Very faint. She could have brushed past someone wearing perfume in the corridor of the guest house, or in the crowded streets. Or the previous occupant of her room might have worn it, and the scent had lingered on the furniture.

It was a detail. Possibly irrelevant.

Cornelius filed it away and returned his attention to Dr. Floros's account.

"—and then I went downstairs," she was saying. "The common room was full. Half the town seemed to be eating breakfast there. I didn't recognize most of them, but the innkeeper's wife said something about Festival guests taking all the usual tables. I sat by the window and had more tea."

"How long were you downstairs?"

"Perhaps half an hour? The service was slow. Everyone was talking about the beetles and whether the migration would peak tonight or tomorrow. I was not paying close attention."

"And when you returned to your room?"

"The door was still locked. I used my key. But the window—" She gestured sharply. "Wide open. The curtains were flapping. And the journal was gone."

Cornelius's eyes narrowed. "The door was locked, but the window was open."

"Yes."

"Which suggests the thief entered and exited via the window, not the corridor."

"That's what I thought." Dr. Floros leaned forward. "Someone must have climbed up from the alley. But I searched the ground below. There were no footprints, no scuff marks on the wall. Nothing."

Interesting. Either the thief was exceptionally careful, or the alley had been too trafficked to preserve useful evidence. During Festival, both were equally plausible.

"Did you notice anyone watching you?" Cornelius asked. "Either yesterday or this morning. Someone taking unusual interest in your work."

Dr. Floros hesitated. "There was... a monk. Brother Demos, I think his name was. He approached me yesterday in the market. Said he had read my monograph and wanted to discuss the theological implications of cyclical plant life. Something about divine patterns in botanical growth cycles." She waved a hand dismissively. "I was polite but brief. I had supplies to purchase."

Cornelius's ear-frills pricked sharply forward. "Did you mention the Orchid to him?"

"No. Absolutely not. I've told no one except Imelda, and that was weeks ago in a sealed letter."

"Describe this Brother Demos."

"Tall. Thin. Very pale. He wore the gray robes of the temple scholars—the ones who study in the archives all day and never see sunlight." She frowned. "He seemed earnest. A little intense, perhaps. But not... I mean, I didn't think..."

She trailed off, looking miserable.

Cornelius felt a flicker of sympathy. Scholars were trusting by nature. They assumed others shared their reverence for knowledge. It made them excellent colleagues and terrible judges of character.

"Zephyr," he said, without turning his head. "Do you know Brother Demos?"

"Uh. Yeah." Zeph shifted his weight. "I mean, I know *of* him. He comes into the library sometimes. Reads the old theology texts. Keeps to himself."

"Has he requested access to the Botanical Collection?"

Zeph blinked. "I don't think so? I can check the logs."

"Do so. Now."

The boy nodded and hurried toward the filing cabinet where Cornelius kept meticulous records of every patron request, cross-referenced by name, date, and subject matter.

Dr. Floros watched him go, then looked back at Cornelius. "You think Brother Demos took my journal?"

"I think," Cornelius said carefully, "that a monk who expresses sudden interest in a visiting botanist, mere days before a once-in-fifty-years bloom, bears investigation."

He did not mention the missing volume from his own collection. Not yet. If Brother Demos had stolen *Secret Wonders* six weeks ago, he might have been planning this theft for some time. Researching. Learning the patterns of the library, the guest house, the town.

But why? What did a temple scholar want with medicinal herbs and rare orchids?

The answer rose immediately: Money. Rare plants could be sold to collectors, apothecaries, perfumers. A single Moon-Scented Orchid, documented and harvested at peak bloom, could fetch a small fortune.

Cornelius felt his talons flex against the polished wood of the desk. Book thieves were bad enough. But book thieves who stole for *profit* rather than love of knowledge—

"Boss." Zeph had returned, holding the log book. "Brother Demos requested access to the Herbaria Medica section three times in the past two months. Last request was..." He squinted at the page. "Four weeks ago."

Four weeks. Two weeks before Cornelius's Spring Inventory, when *Secret Wonders* was confirmed present.

And two weeks after, the book was gone.

The pattern sharpened into focus.

"What did he request specifically?" Cornelius asked.

"Uh, looks like he wanted anything on rare coastal plants. Medicinal properties. Cultivation cycles." Zeph looked up. "He seemed really interested in the bloom schedules."

Dr. Floros made a small, distressed sound. "He was researching. Learning enough to know the journal's value."

"So it would appear." Cornelius stood, stretching his wings briefly before folding them tight again. His mind was already racing ahead, cataloging next steps.

He needed to locate Brother Demos. Question him. Search his quarters if necessary. If the monk had both *Secret Wonders* and Dr. Floros's journal, they would be hidden somewhere he felt secure. The temple archives, perhaps. Or a private room.

But first, he needed to confirm the monk was actually in town. The Festival drew travelers from across the region, but the temple scholars typically avoided the chaos. They preferred their quiet archives and—

A flicker of movement outside the window caught his eye.

Cornelius went still, every predatory instinct suddenly alert.

There. In the alley behind the library. A figure in gray robes, moving fast, head down. The hem of the robe flapped as the figure ran, revealing muddy boots.

And in the figure's arms, clutched tight against his chest: a brown leather book.

Twenty centimeters tall. Distinctive pressed-flower design just visible on the cover, catching the light.

Brother Demos.

Running.

With a book.

The fury that rose in Cornelius's chest was cold and sharp and absolutely certain. That was *his* thief. The thief who had violated the sanctity of his library, stolen from his collection, and then had the audacity to steal from a visiting scholar.

"There," he hissed, launching himself from the desk.

He hit the window ledge at full speed, talons scrabbling for purchase on the stone sill. His wings flared for balance. Below, Brother Demos glanced up at the sound, face pale and startled in the late afternoon light.

Their eyes met for a single, frozen instant.

Then the monk turned and ran.

Cornelius's vision narrowed to a predatory focus. The synthetic musk scent, the timeline inconsistencies, the question of why a temple scholar would need rare botanical texts—all of it faded into background noise.

The facts were simple:

Missing library book. Brown leather. Botanical content.

Missing field journal. Brown leather. Botanical content.

Monk with known interest in medicinal plants, fleeing the scene, clutching a brown leather book.

It was not subtle. It was not clever.

It was *obvious*.

And Cornelius had spent a century cataloging, organizing, and solving puzzles. He knew how to recognize a pattern when it ran directly past his window.

"Zephyr," he said, very calmly. "Fetch my investigation satchel from the office. The brown leather one. Second shelf, left side."

"Uh, Boss? What are you—"

"*Now*, Zephyr."

The boy scrambled to obey.

Cornelius turned to Dr. Floros, who had risen from her chair and was staring out the window with wide eyes. "Your thief," he said, "is Brother Demos. I have just seen him. He is currently fleeing east through the service alleys with what I believe to be your journal."

She pressed a hand to her mouth. "You're certain?"

"I am certain he is running, in broad daylight, with a leather book clutched to his chest like a guilty child stealing sweets." Cornelius felt his tail lash once, a sharp flick of satisfaction. "Innocent men do not run. Particularly not when they have been observed."

"Then we have to go after him!" Dr. Floros started toward the door. "If he reaches the temple—"

"Dr. Floros." Cornelius fixed her with a steady look. "I appreciate your urgency. But chasing him through the Festival crowds in your current state will accomplish nothing except exhausting yourself and alerting him that he is being pursued. Better to approach this intelligently."

She stopped, visibly forcing herself to calm. "What do you propose?"

"I propose," Cornelius said, as Zeph returned with the satchel, "that we visit the temple. Quietly. We will speak to the head priest, review Brother Demos's quarters, and recover your journal through official channels. If he has fled there seeking sanctuary, we will have him cornered. If he has fled elsewhere, the temple records will tell us where he might go."

It was logical. Methodical. Properly procedural.

It was also deeply, personally satisfying.

No one stole books in his town. Not from his library. Not from visiting scholars under his protection.

And certainly not from Imelda's friends.

Cornelius felt the familiar, comfortable weight of a case settling over him like a well-worn cloak. The wrongness of the missing volume, the anxiety of the disrupted inventory—all of it crystallized into purpose.

He would find Brother Demos.

He would recover the stolen books.

And he would restore order.

"Zephyr," he said. "Lock the library. We are going out."

The boy's eyes went wide. "But—my date—Sophia's expecting me at—"

"This will take one hour. Perhaps less, if Brother Demos proves cooperative." Cornelius spread his wings and glided to the floor, landing beside his satchel. "You may still make your Festival appointment. But first, we have a thief to apprehend."

Zeph looked torn. Then he sighed and reached for his coat. "Fine. But if I miss the beetle lighting, you're explaining it to Sophia."

"Noted." Cornelius nosed open the satchel and did a quick inventory: notebook, three pencils, a measuring tape, a magnifying lens, and a small vial of ink for taking notes in the field. Everything in order. Everything in its place.

He looked up at Dr. Floros. "I will recover your journal, Doctor. You have my word."

She stared at him for a long moment. Then, slowly, she nodded. 

"Thank you," she whispered.

Cornelius inclined his head in acknowledgment, already calculating routes and approach strategies.

The Hunt had begun.

# Chapter 3

The Sea View Guest House stood three stories tall, its whitewashed walls pressing close to its neighbors on either side. Cornelius adjusted his spectacles and surveyed the building with a critical eye. Blue shutters flanked each window—some open, some closed, all faded to varying degrees by proximity to the harbor. A wrought-iron balcony jutted from the second floor, draped with drying linens that flapped in the breeze like territorial flags.

Not a dignified establishment, then. But not a hovel either.

He turned to Dr. Floros, who had stopped at the base of the front steps. Her hands were knotted together, knuckles pale.

"Which room?" he asked.

"Second floor. Third door on the left." Her voice had steadied somewhat during the walk from the library, but her breathing remained shallow. "Room Seven."

"Wait here." Cornelius shifted the weight of his investigation satchel and started up the steps. Behind him, he heard Zeph mutter something that might have been a complaint about stairs.

The front door opened into a narrow entry hall papered in faded geometric patterns that had once, perhaps, been fashionable. A woman stood behind a small desk wedged into the corner, scribbling in a ledger. She looked up as Cornelius entered.

"Help you?" she asked. Then her gaze dropped to floor level, found him, and her expression shifted to mild surprise. "Oh. Didn't see you there."

Cornelius was accustomed to this. Humans had a tendency to look for threats at their own eye level, which meant a cat-sized dragon was often overlooked until he spoke.

"I am Cornelius Drake, Head Librarian of Solterra Bay," he said, drawing himself up to his full height on the doormat. "I am investigating a theft from Room Seven. I require access."

The woman—Nephele, according to the small wooden nameplate on her desk—set down her pen. She had the weathered hands of someone who worked outdoors and the tired eyes of someone who worked two jobs. Cornelius recognized her from the fish market. She sold mackerel in the mornings and apparently managed guest house administration in the afternoons.

"Dr. Floros already reported it to the Watch," Nephele said. "Captain Theo told her to wait until tomorrow."

"Captain Theo," Cornelius said with careful precision, "is a bureaucrat with all the investigative instincts of a very slow brick. I, however, am not. Now. The key, if you please."

Nephele's mouth twitched. She reached into a drawer and produced a brass key. "Second floor. But if you break anything, I'm charging the library."

"I do not break things," Cornelius said. "I am a professional."

He took the key in his talons and glided up the staircase, Zeph's heavier footsteps thudding behind him. Dr. Floros brought up the rear, moving with the reluctance of someone returning to the scene of a disaster.

The second-floor corridor was narrow and dim. Four doors lined each side, their painted numbers worn to ghosts. Cornelius landed in front of Room Seven and inserted the key with a satisfying click.

The door swung open.

Cornelius's first thought was that Dr. Floros had undersold the state of the room. His second thought was that she had clearly never learned the most basic principles of field organization.

Papers covered every surface. The writing desk was buried beneath loose sketches, rock samples, and what appeared to be three different field guides left open to various pages. The bed frame supported a teetering stack of botanical references. A canvas satchel had vomited its contents across the floor—specimen jars, pencils, a magnifying glass with a cracked lens, and several cloth bundles that smelled faintly of dried roots.

"Good grief," Cornelius muttered.

"I was working," Dr. Floros said defensively from the doorway. "I needed everything accessible."

"Accessible and organized are not mutually exclusive concepts." Cornelius stepped carefully over a scatter of pressed flowers and made his way to the writing desk. "This is chaos."

"This is research."

"This is a fire hazard waiting for a convenient spark." He turned in a slow circle, cataloging the room. The bed, the desk, the wardrobe, the washstand. One window overlooking the street. One window—

There.

The second window stood open, curtains drifting inward on the evening breeze. Cornelius crossed to it and examined the latch. It was simple iron, well-made but showing signs of age. He tested it with one claw. The mechanism moved smoothly. No scratches. No sign of forced entry.

"You are certain this was latched when you left for breakfast?" he asked.

"Yes." Dr. Floros had not moved from the doorway. "I always check the windows before I leave. Force of habit from sleeping in field camps."

Cornelius leaned out and looked down. The window opened onto a narrow service alley barely three meters wide. The walls on either side were rough limestone, offering ample handholds for anyone with climbing experience or sufficient motivation. A stack of crates sat against the opposite wall, forming a makeshift ladder to the first-floor level. From there, a reasonably fit human could scale to the second floor without much difficulty.

He pulled back inside and turned his attention to the desk.

The papers scattered across its surface were covered in Dr. Floros's cramped handwriting—observations, measurements, botanical sketches. But in the center of the desk, a clean rectangle stood out against the dust.

Cornelius went very still.

The outline was perhaps twenty centimeters tall and fifteen wide. Exactly the dimensions Dr. Floros had described for her journal. The dust around it showed gentle scuff marks where the book had been slid forward and lifted.

Not grabbed in haste. Moved carefully.

Deliberately.

"Zephyr," Cornelius said. "Bring me the magnifying lens from my satchel."

The boy had been hovering near the door, trying to look useful while simultaneously glancing back toward the stairwell every few seconds. He retrieved the lens and handed it over.

Cornelius examined the clean rectangle closely, then the area immediately surrounding it. The desk's surface was cluttered but not filthy. Dr. Floros clearly cleaned with some regularity. Which meant the dust pattern was recent—within the past few days.

And there, at the edge of the outline, something glinted.

He adjusted the lens and leaned closer.

Crushed glass. Tiny fragments, nearly invisible against the wood. They caught the light at sharp angles, prismatic and wrong.

"Curious," he muttered.

"What is it?" Dr. Floros took a hesitant step into the room.

"Glass fragments. Very small. Freshly broken, I would estimate." Cornelius touched one shard with the tip of his claw. It was thin. Precise. Not the heavy greenish glass of common bottles or jars. This was something finer.

"Zeph," he said. "What kind of glass is this?"

The boy crouched down beside him, squinting at the fragments. "Uh. Looks like... borosilicate?"

Cornelius's ear-frills pricked forward. "You are certain?"

"Yeah. My cousin works at the alchemist's shop on Harbor Street. They use borosilicate for all their lab stuff. It's thinner than regular glass. Doesn't crack from temperature changes." Zeph picked up one of the larger fragments and held it to the light. "See how clear it is? No bubbles. That's expensive."

Borosilicate glass. Used in alchemical laboratories and by scholars who required precision instruments. Not the sort of thing one found lying about in a guest house.

Which meant the thief had brought it. Or broken it during the theft.

But why would someone stealing a leather journal be carrying laboratory glass?

Cornelius filed the question away and continued his examination. The dust outline, the glass, the open window. All pointed to a swift, targeted theft. The thief had known exactly what they wanted and where to find it.

He turned his attention to the rest of the desk. Papers. Rocks. Three different field guides—one on coastal flora, one on limestone geology, one on medicinal compounds. A jar of drawing ink. A ceramic cup holding five pencils of varying lengths.

And beneath it all, faint but unmistakable, a scent.

Cornelius went still, nostrils flaring.

Synthetic musk. The same scent he had detected on Dr. Floros earlier. But here it was stronger. Concentrated. It clung to the desk surface, the papers, the very air around the spot where the journal had rested.

He breathed it in carefully, analyzing. Sharp. Chemical. Expensive. The sort of fragrance wealthy patrons wore to make themselves memorable. And beneath the musk, something else—a floral note. Jasmine, perhaps. Or orchid.

Memory clicked into place.

This was not generic perfume. This was a specific blend. He had smelled it before, years ago, when a traveling merchant had tried to sell him a collection of rare texts wrapped in scented silk. The merchant had reeked of the stuff, and Cornelius had spent the next day airing out the library.

The merchant had called it "Kyriakos No. 5."

A perfumer's signature scent. Made by the House of Vlahos, sold to collectors and the fashionably wealthy. Cornelius had dismissed it at the time as an overpriced novelty for humans with more money than sense.

But here it was again. On Dr. Floros. On her desk. Strong enough to linger hours after the theft.

"Zeph," he said slowly. "Do you smell anything unusual?"

The boy sniffed. "Yeah. Smells like... I dunno. Perfume?"

"What kind of perfume?"

Zeph sniffed again, more carefully this time. His expression shifted to something like recognition. "Oh. That's Kyriakos. No. 5, I think. Sophia's mom has a bottle. She wears it on special occasions."

"Kyriakos No. 5," Cornelius repeated.

"Yeah. It's kind of expensive. Like, really expensive." Zeph stood and brushed off his knees. "Why would someone wearing that be stealing books?"

An excellent question.

Cornelius turned it over in his mind. Brother Demos was a temple scholar. Temple scholars took vows of modest living. They wore simple gray robes and ate communal meals and devoted themselves to study. They did not, as a general rule, wear expensive perfume.

Unless Brother Demos was not what he appeared to be.

Or unless the thief was not Brother Demos at all.

The thought arrived with the cold clarity of a bibliographic error spotted in a rare manuscript. Certain. Undeniable. Accompanied by a faint sensation of anxiety.

Cornelius pushed it aside.

No. He had seen Brother Demos fleeing with a brown leather book. Dr. Floros had confirmed the monk's interest in her work. The patron logs showed Demos researching rare coastal plants. The pattern was clear. The evidence was solid.

The perfume was simply... an anomaly. Perhaps Demos had purchased it as part of his scheme. To disguise himself. To appear wealthier than he was when negotiating with potential buyers for the stolen journal.

Yes. That made sense.

It had to make sense, because the alternative—that he had misidentified the thief and sent them chasing the wrong suspect—was unacceptable.

"Boss?" Zeph was looking at him with concern. "You okay?"

"I am fine." Cornelius shook himself and returned to the desk. "The perfume is simply evidence of poor taste. Many thieves have delusions of sophistication."

He made a notation in his small notebook: *Kyriakos No. 5 detected at scene. Borosilicate glass fragments. Open window, unforced latch.*

Then he turned to examine the rest of the room. The wardrobe held Dr. Floros's traveling clothes—practical tunics, sturdy trousers, a heavy cloak. The washstand held soap, a comb, and a small mirror. Nothing unusual. Nothing out of place beyond the general chaos of her working method.

He glided to the open window and looked out again.

The service alley was empty now. But across the gap, on the neighboring building's terrace, someone moved.

Cornelius's eyes narrowed.

A young woman sat on a low stool, a sketchbook balanced on her knees. She wore a simple linen dress the color of terra-cotta, and her dark hair was pinned back with what appeared to be ceramic clasps shaped like beetles. Her hand moved in quick, precise strokes across the page.

She was not looking at the alley. She was looking up, toward the terrace above, where strings of unlit Festival lanterns hung waiting for nightfall.

Calculating. Measuring angles with the end of her pencil.

An artist.

"Oh no," Zeph breathed.

Cornelius glanced back at his assistant. The boy had gone rigid, eyes fixed on the woman across the alley. His hand had moved unconsciously to his hair, attempting to smooth down the mess the wind had made of it. His other hand plucked at the front of his tunic—the one he had worn to help carry Dr. Floros's things, which now bore a suspicious fish-scale pattern along one sleeve.

"Zephyr," Cornelius said. "Focus."

"That's Sophia," Zeph whispered.

"I assumed as much, given your sudden paralysis."

"She's right there. I look like—" He gestured helplessly at himself. "I smell like mackerel."

"You smell like a human who has been working. It is not a moral failing."

"I was supposed to meet her at the Festival. Looking nice. Not like... this." Zeph's voice had taken on a plaintive edge.

Cornelius felt his tail lash once in irritation. "Zephyr. We are conducting an investigation. Your romantic prospects are not the priority."

But the boy was not listening. He had moved to the window, leaning out slightly, attempting to catch Sophia's attention without actually calling out to her. It was a masterclass in human inefficiency.

Cornelius considered his options. He could drag Zeph bodily away from the window. He could deliver a lecture on professional conduct during field investigations. He could assign him to stand guard in the hallway until his brain resumed normal function.

Or he could complete the investigation himself and deal with the distracted assistant later.

The third option was most efficient.

"Stay here," Cornelius said. "Do not touch anything. Do not fall out the window. I am going to speak with Dr. Floros."

Zeph made a vague sound of acknowledgment, still staring at Sophia.

Cornelius glided back to the doorway, where Dr. Floros waited with Nephele. The guest house clerk had apparently come upstairs to ensure they were not, in fact, destroying the room.

"Well?" Dr. Floros asked. "Did you find anything?"

"I found evidence consistent with a planned theft," Cornelius said. "The window was unlatched from inside, suggesting the thief had prior access to your room. The journal was removed carefully, not grabbed in haste. And there are fragments of borosilicate glass on the desk, which suggests your thief uses laboratory equipment."

Dr. Floros pressed a hand to her mouth. "Then it was someone with alchemical knowledge. Someone who understood the value of the compounds in my notes."

"Possibly." Cornelius did not mention the perfume. It was a detail. Possibly irrelevant. Possibly a distraction from the clear pattern that pointed directly to Brother Demos.

He turned to Nephele. "Have you seen Brother Demos in this building?"

The clerk frowned. "The monk from the temple?"

"Yes."

"Can't say I have. He keeps to the archives, doesn't he? I've seen him in the market once or twice, but never here."

"Have you seen anyone else enter Room Seven? Anyone who seemed out of place?"

Nephele shook her head. "I work mornings at the fish stall. I'm only here afternoons. You'd have to ask Petros—he does the night shift."

Another dead end. Cornelius's tail twitched in annoyance.

"Very well," he said. "Thank you for your cooperation."

He returned to the room to collect Zeph, who was still gazing longingly at Sophia's terrace. The artist had finished her sketch and was now packing her supplies into a leather satchel. She moved with the efficient grace of someone who had done this a thousand times.

"Zephyr," Cornelius said firmly. "We are leaving."

"But—"

"Now."

The boy tore his gaze away from the window and followed Cornelius into the hallway. His expression was tragic.

"I look like a fish merchant," he muttered.

"You *are* assisting a fish merchant's investigation into your employment," Cornelius said. "You should be proud of your practical attire."

"That's not how dating works, Boss."

"Then I am grateful to be a dragon."

They descended the stairs and exited the guest house. Dr. Floros was waiting on the front steps, wringing her hands.

"So?" she asked. "What now?"

Cornelius adjusted his spectacles and considered the evidence.

One: Brother Demos had shown specific interest in rare coastal plants and bloom schedules.

Two: The timeline of his library requests aligned with the disappearance of *Secret Wonders*.

Three: He had been observed fleeing with a brown leather book matching the description of Dr. Floros's journal.

Four: The theft showed planning and inside knowledge.

Five: Borosilicate glass and expensive perfume at the crime scene.

Points one through four formed a clear pattern. Point five was... anomalous. But not impossible. Thieves were often messy. They made mistakes. They wore perfume they could not afford and broke equipment they should not have been carrying.

The simplest explanation was that Brother Demos had gotten sloppy.

Cornelius was a scholar. He believed in evidence. He believed in patterns. And the pattern here pointed to the temple.

"Now," he said, "we go to the temple. We find Brother Demos. And we recover your journal."

Dr. Floros nodded, relief flooding her features.

Zeph sighed and cast one last look back at the guest house.

And Cornelius, satisfied that he had correctly identified his culprit, led them toward the temple district.

The Hunt continued.

# Chapter 4

# Chapter 4

The fish market occupied the lowest tier of the harbor district, where the stone walkways met the sea. Cornelius had avoided this part of town for the better part of a decade. He was reminded, as he descended the final set of worn steps, why that had been an excellent decision.

The smell hit him first.

Not the clean, salt-bright scent of the open water. Not even the ordinary fish-and-brine smell of a working harbor. This was something far more visceral. Fresh-caught mackerel and yesterday's unsold stock. Seaweed baking on stone. The metallic tang of fish blood running in rivulets between the paving tiles.

Cornelius's nostrils flared once, cataloging the offense, then he shut his mouth firmly and resolved to breathe as little as possible.

The market sprawled across a wide plaza overlooking the docks. Wooden stalls formed uneven rows, their awnings patched and salt-stained. Merchants shouted prices. Gulls screamed overhead, diving for scraps. A group of children chased each other between the stalls, their feet slapping through puddles of dubious origin.

Chaos. Complete and utter chaos.

Cornelius's tail lashed once in irritation. He had left Dr. Floros and Zeph at a small tavern two streets back, with instructions to wait while he pursued this final line of inquiry. Zeph had been visibly relieved. The boy had been checking his reflection in every shop window they passed, attempting to smooth his hair into something other than "windblown disaster."

Hopeless. But at least it kept him occupied.

Cornelius adjusted his spectacles and scanned the market. Nephele's stall would be near the water, where the fishing boats unloaded their catch. He picked his way carefully between the vendors, stepping over coiled ropes and avoiding the larger puddles.

A woman selling clams eyed him as he passed. "Looking for something, little drake?"

"Information," Cornelius said crisply. "I am seeking Nephele."

The woman jerked her thumb toward the far end of the plaza. "Last stall on the left. She's packing up for the day."

Cornelius inclined his head in thanks and continued on.

The crowd thickened near the water's edge. Fishermen hauled baskets of the day's catch onto the stone pier. A man in rubber boots gutted a massive tuna with practiced efficiency, tossing the innards into a bucket already swarming with flies. Cornelius gave the bucket a wide berth and tried not to think about how long those flies might live if they found their way into his library.

Another problem for another day. Preferably never.

He spotted Nephele's stall ahead. It was larger than the others, with a proper tile counter and three separate display trays filled with ice and fish. A wooden sign hung overhead: *Nephele's Catch – Fresh Daily*.

Nephele herself stood behind the counter, sluicing water over the tiles with a bucket. She had changed from the simple clerk's tunic she had worn at the guest house. Now she wore a heavy canvas apron over rough trousers, both liberally stained with fish scales and what Cornelius sincerely hoped was only water.

She looked up as he approached. Recognition flickered across her face, followed by wary resignation.

"Master Drake," she said. "Didn't expect to see you down here."

"I do not make a habit of visiting the docks," Cornelius agreed. He hopped onto a relatively clean section of the counter and settled into a sitting position, tail wrapped neatly around his haunches. "However, I have additional questions regarding the theft at the guest house."

Nephele set down her bucket and wiped her hands on her apron. It did not improve their cleanliness. "I already told you everything I know."

"You told me what you observed during your shift at the guest house," Cornelius corrected. "However, I have since learned that you were in the vicinity of Room Seven yesterday evening. I require clarification."

Her expression shifted—just slightly. A tightening around the eyes. Not quite guilt. More like the look of someone who had been caught doing something they would prefer to keep private.

"I wasn't *in* the room," she said carefully.

"But you were nearby."

A pause. Then she sighed and leaned against the counter. "Yeah. I was in the alley. Making a delivery."

"What sort of delivery?"

"Oysters." She gestured toward a smaller ice tray at the edge of her stall, where a dozen oysters sat in perfect rows. "Special order. Some rich fool staying at the Seacliff wanted the freshest catch before the Festival. Said he'd pay double if I delivered them to his villa personally."

Cornelius's ear-frills pricked forward. "The Seacliff Villa?"

"Yeah. The fancy place on the hill. Takes twenty minutes to walk there, and the whole time I'm carrying a basket of oysters on ice." She shook her head. "But he paid in advance, so I went."

"What time was this?"

"Around seven bells. Just before sunset. I'd already closed the stall for the day."

Seven bells. Dr. Floros had been at breakfast at eight bells. Which meant Nephele had been near the guest house approximately one hour before the theft.

Cornelius made a mental note and continued his questioning. "Did you enter the guest house?"

"No. I cut through the service alley to save time. It's a shortcut to the hill road."

"Did you see anyone else in the alley?"

Nephele frowned, thinking. "There was someone. A man in a hood. Didn't get a good look at his face. He was near the guest house wall, kind of lurking by the crates. I thought maybe he worked there—you know, taking a break or something. Didn't think much of it."

Cornelius went very still. A hooded man. Near the guest house. At precisely the right time for someone planning a theft.

Brother Demos.

It had to be. Temple scholars wore hooded robes. And Demos had already proven willing to flee when spotted. Of course he would skulk in alleys, preparing his crime.

The pattern solidified further. Nephele had inadvertently witnessed the thief casing his target.

"Did this man speak to you?" Cornelius asked.

"Nope. He just kind of... moved back into the shadows when I passed. Like he didn't want to be seen." She shrugged. "Figured he was meeting someone he shouldn't. You know how it is during Festival. People get stupid."

"Indeed." Cornelius's mind was already cataloging the new information. Brother Demos, hooded and furtive, positioned near Room Seven's window one hour before the theft. Waiting for Dr. Floros to leave. Planning his approach.

It all fit.

"This delivery," Cornelius said, returning to the earlier thread. "Who placed the order?"

"Some perfumer. Kyriakos something. Vlahos, I think." Nephele wrinkled her nose. "Fancy type. Wore enough cologne to choke a horse. Paid with actual gold, though, so I wasn't about to complain."

Cornelius's ear-frills flattened slightly. Kyriakos Vlahos. The name was familiar. The perfumer who made Kyriakos No. 5—the scent detected at the crime scene.

A small, uncomfortable prickle of unease crept down his spine.

But no. That was simply coincidence. Kyriakos Vlahos was a celebrity perfumer. Of course his scent would be prevalent during Festival season. Wealthy patrons wore it. Merchants sold it. The entire upper district probably reeked of it by now.

The fact that Nephele had encountered him shortly before the theft meant nothing.

Cornelius pushed the thought aside and focused on what mattered: Nephele herself.

She was a large woman. Not fat, but solid. The kind of build that came from hauling fish baskets and scrubbing market stalls. Her hands were rough and capable, her arms corded with muscle. She moved with the heavy certainty of someone who knew exactly how much space she occupied and did not particularly care if it inconvenienced others.

In short, she was the exact opposite of stealthy.

The thief who had entered Room Seven had opened a window, navigated a cluttered desk, removed a specific journal without disturbing the surrounding papers, and departed without leaving footprints in the alley below. That required precision. Delicacy. Light feet and steady hands.

Nephele gutted tuna for a living. She slammed buckets onto stone counters. She smelled, quite frankly, like the inside of a fishing boat.

There was no possible way she could have executed the theft at the guest house.

"Did you return to the guest house after making your delivery?" Cornelius asked.

"Nope. Went straight home. I live above Cassius's bakery, three streets over from the harbor. Got in around nine bells, had dinner, went to bed." She crossed her arms. "Ask Cassius if you don't believe me. He was closing up when I came in. We talked for a bit."

An alibi. Solid and easily verified.

Cornelius felt a small satisfaction settle into place. Nephele was not the thief. She had been in the wrong place at an inconvenient time, but she had not stolen Dr. Floros's journal.

Which left Brother Demos.

"One final question," Cornelius said. "This perfumer—Kyriakos Vlahos. What was he doing at the Seacliff Villa?"

Nephele shrugged. "How should I know? Probably staying there for the Festival. Rich people do that. Rent the fancy villas, throw parties, show off their money." She picked up her bucket again. "He seemed pleased with the oysters, though. Gave me a tip on top of the payment. Said they were 'exquisitely fresh.'"

She said it in a mocking, high-pitched tone that suggested what she thought of people who used words like "exquisitely" for shellfish.

Cornelius found himself in rare agreement with her assessment.

"Thank you for your cooperation," he said, hopping down from the counter. "If you recall anything else about the hooded man in the alley, send word to the library."

"Sure thing." Nephele returned to her cleaning, already dismissing him.

Cornelius picked his way back through the market, mind churning.

Nephele: eliminated. Too large, too loud, too obvious. And she had an alibi.

Brother Demos: still the primary suspect. Hooded figure seen at the scene. Proven interest in rare plants. Observed fleeing with a brown leather book.

Kyriakos Vlahos: irrelevant. A wealthy perfumer with expensive tastes and poor timing. His presence near the guest house was simply the result of Nephele's delivery route.

The synthetic musk scent at the crime scene was still an anomaly. But perhaps Dr. Floros had encountered Kyriakos at some point. A chance meeting in the market. A conversation near the guest house. The perfume was distinctive enough to linger.

Yes. That made sense.

Cornelius emerged from the fish market and paused at the top of the harbor steps, allowing himself a moment to breathe clean air. The plaza above was crowded with Festival preparations. Merchants strung lanterns between the buildings. A group of musicians practiced on a makeshift stage. Children ran past carrying paper beetles on sticks.

The chaos of Festival had provided perfect cover for a thief. But it had also provided witnesses. And witnesses, however inadvertent, created patterns.

Nephele had seen a hooded man.

Dr. Floros had been approached by Brother Demos.

Cornelius himself had observed Demos fleeing with a leather book.

Three separate points of data, all converging on the same conclusion.

Brother Demos was the thief.

Cornelius felt his scales settle into a more comfortable arrangement. The case was nearly closed. All that remained was to confront the monk, recover the stolen journals, and restore order.

He turned and began the walk back toward the tavern where he had left Dr. Floros and Zeph.

The streets were fuller now as the town prepared for the evening's festivities. Vendors sold roasted nuts from wooden carts. A woman demonstrated beetle-shaped kites to a crowd of delighted children. Someone had placed small oil lamps in the shop windows, their flames casting warm light onto the cobblestones.

Cornelius ignored it all. His mind was already planning the next steps.

First, return to Dr. Floros. Inform her that Nephele was not a viable suspect.

Second, proceed to the temple. Request an audience with the head priest.

Third, present the evidence against Brother Demos and demand access to his quarters.

Fourth, recover the journals and return them to their rightful owners.

Simple. Logical. Efficient.

Exactly how an investigation should proceed.

He reached the tavern—a modest establishment called The Copper Kettle—and slipped through the half-open door. The interior was dim and smelled of bread and olive oil. Dr. Floros sat at a corner table, nursing a cup of tea. Zeph lounged in the chair beside her, attempting to make his windblown hair lie flat through sheer force of will.

Dr. Floros looked up as Cornelius approached. "Did you find anything?"

"I found confirmation," Cornelius said, hopping onto the table. "Nephele was near the guest house yesterday evening, but she has a solid alibi and lacks the physical capability to execute the theft. However, she observed a hooded figure lurking near Room Seven at approximately seven bells. I believe this was Brother Demos, surveilling his target."

Dr. Floros's hand tightened around her teacup. "Then we have him."

"We have evidence," Cornelius corrected. "Which we will present to the temple authorities. Properly. Through official channels."

Zeph snorted. "Since when do you care about official channels?"

"Since I require access to a monk's private quarters," Cornelius said. "Temple law grants certain protections. We cannot simply search Brother Demos's rooms without the head priest's consent. Therefore, we will request it. Politely. With evidence."

He said it with the same tone one might use to explain basic arithmetic to a particularly slow student.

Zeph rolled his eyes but did not argue.

Dr. Floros drained the last of her tea and stood. "Then let us go to the temple."

Cornelius hesitated.

The sky outside had begun to dim. Not full dark yet, but approaching the threshold when the Festival lights would be lit and the town would transform into a maze of lanterns and shadows. The temple was a ten-minute walk from here, through increasingly crowded streets.

Confronting Brother Demos in the chaos of Festival evening, with witnesses and distractions everywhere, was inefficient.

Better to wait until morning. When the temple would be quiet. When the head priest would be available for proper discussion. When Cornelius could approach the situation with the full weight of daylight and clear-headed logic.

"No," he said. "We wait until morning."

Dr. Floros stared at him. "But—the Orchid—"

"Will still be blooming in three days," Cornelius said firmly. "We have time. And I prefer to conduct investigations when I can see clearly and think without distraction. Brother Demos is not going anywhere. The temple is his sanctuary. He believes himself safe there."

He let his tail curl in satisfaction. "Which means we have the advantage."

Dr. Floros looked like she wanted to argue. But after a moment, her shoulders sagged. "You are right. I am simply... anxious."

"Understandable," Cornelius said, more gently. "But anxiety leads to mistakes. We will proceed methodically. I will meet you at the library at eight bells tomorrow morning. We will go to the temple together, present our evidence, and recover your journal. I promise you."

She nodded, though she did not look entirely convinced.

Zeph stood and stretched. "So I can still make the Festival tonight?"

"Yes, yes. Go impress your tile artist." Cornelius waved a dismissive wing. "But be at the library by eight bells tomorrow. On time. Not 'Zeph time.'"

The boy grinned and was out the door before Cornelius could issue further instructions.

Dr. Floros gathered her cloak. "I suppose I should return to the guest house. Try to sleep, though I doubt I will manage it."

"I recommend chamomile tea and a good book," Cornelius said. "It has never failed me."

She smiled faintly. "I will try. Thank you, Master Drake. For taking this seriously. For helping me."

"Books are serious business," Cornelius said. "Stolen books even more so."

He watched her leave, then sat alone at the table for a moment, organizing his thoughts.

The case was clear. The evidence pointed to Brother Demos. The pattern was unmistakable.

And yet.

That small, uncomfortable prickle of unease had not entirely faded.

Kyriakos Vlahos. Celebrity perfumer. Present near the guest house at the right time. Wealthy enough to purchase rare botanical specimens. Connected to the scent found at the crime scene.

But also: a public figure. Someone who would be recognized. Someone who would leave obvious traces.

The thief who stole Dr. Floros's journal had been careful. Deliberate. They had opened the window from inside, suggesting prior access. They had removed the journal without disturbing the surrounding chaos. They had left only broken glass and a lingering scent.

Would a celebrity perfumer risk such a theft personally?

Unlikely.

Would Brother Demos, a reclusive scholar with proven interest in rare plants and a history of requesting botanical texts?

Far more plausible.

Cornelius's scales settled. The unease faded.

He was overthinking. A common flaw in intellectuals. The simplest explanation was usually correct. Brother Demos was the thief. The hooded figure Nephele had seen confirmed it.

Tomorrow, he would prove it.

Cornelius hopped down from the table and made his way toward the door. The evening air greeted him, cool and tinged with the sweet smell of roasting chestnuts from a nearby cart. The first Festival lanterns were being lit, their warm glow reflecting off the tile roofs.

He turned toward the library. His sanctuary. His hoard.

Where everything was in order. Where every book knew its place. Where the world made sense according to clear, logical rules.

Tomorrow, he would restore that same order to Dr. Floros's life.

Tonight, he would review his notes. Prepare his arguments for the temple authorities. Perhaps enjoy a cup of mint tea and a chapter of the new natural philosophy text from Khariton.

The Hunt was progressing exactly as it should.

Cornelius felt a deep, satisfied certainty settle into his bones as he walked through the lamplit streets toward home.

He had his thief.

All that remained was proving it.

# Chapter 5

The library had never felt more perfectly ordered than it did at this moment.

Cornelius sat at his desk, the investigation notes spread before him in neat rows. Each piece of evidence occupied its designated space. The timeline ran left to right across the blotter. The witness statements formed a secondary column. The physical evidence—transcribed descriptions of the borosilicate glass, the dust pattern, the perfume—anchored the bottom of the arrangement.

Beautiful. Logical. Irrefutable.

He had spent the past hour reviewing everything, confirming what he already knew: Brother Demos was the thief. The pattern was too clear to be coincidence. Temple scholar requests botanical texts. Library book on coastal herbs goes missing. Scholar approaches botanist about rare plants. Botanist's journal is stolen. Scholar is observed fleeing with a brown leather book.

Simple cause and effect. Elementary deduction.

Tomorrow morning, he would present this evidence to the head priest. The temple authorities would have no choice but to grant him access to Demos's quarters. He would recover both stolen volumes, restore them to their proper places, and the world would return to its correct configuration.

Cornelius allowed himself a small, satisfied rumble.

The front door of the library opened.

He looked up, prepared to inform whatever Festival-addled patron had wandered in that the library was closed for the evening. But the figure that slipped through the doorway was not a patron.

It was Brother Demos.

Cornelius went absolutely still.

The monk moved quickly but quietly, his gray robes whispering against the tile floor. He carried a canvas satchel over one shoulder. His hood was pulled low, shadowing his face. He did not look toward the main desk. Instead, he turned immediately toward the Herbaria Medica section—the botanical texts—and began scanning the shelves.

Looking for something.

Or returning something.

Cornelius's mind moved through the possibilities with crystalline clarity. Demos had come to the library. At night. When he believed it to be empty. To access the botanical collection.

The thief. In his library. *Now.*

Every scale on Cornelius's body locked into alignment. This was not a theory anymore. This was not circumstantial evidence or witness testimony. This was the culprit, caught in the act.

He could confront Demos directly. Demand the return of the stolen journals. But the monk was larger than him, and humans had an unfortunate tendency toward panic when cornered. Demos might bolt. Or worse—he might damage something in his flight.

No. Cornelius needed to contain the situation. Control it. Ensure that the thief could not escape and that the evidence would be preserved for official documentation.

He needed the lockdown.

Cornelius's gaze moved to the brass panel mounted on the wall beside his desk. The emergency protocols. He had installed them decades ago, after a particularly concerning incident involving a scroll thief and a second-story window. The system had cost a small fortune in enchantment fees, but Cornelius had never regretted the expense.

Code Obsidian. Total library lockdown.

Every door would seal. Every window would lock. The building would become impenetrable until Cornelius himself deactivated the sequence.

Perfect.

His claw moved toward the activation rune.

Then he hesitated.

Code Obsidian also triggered an automatic alert to the Town Watch. It was a legal requirement—any magical containment system had to notify the authorities to prevent unlawful imprisonment. Which meant that activating the lockdown would bring Captain Theo directly to his door.

Cornelius's tail twitched in annoyance.

He had spent the better part of a year avoiding Theo after the incident with the overdue municipal charter. The man was tedious. Bureaucratic. He would demand explanations and paperwork and probably insist on processing Demos through official channels, which would take hours and involve endless forms.

But.

The lockdown would also trap Brother Demos with irrefutable certainty. And when Theo arrived, he would find Cornelius standing over a thief caught red-handed in the library's restricted collection. The evidence would be undeniable. The case would be closed.

And Cornelius would be vindicated.

Publicly. Officially. In front of the very Watch captain who had once lectured him about "proper investigative procedure."

The satisfaction of that image was too delicious to resist.

Cornelius pressed his claw to the activation rune.

The library *screamed*.

Not a human scream—a mechanical one. A grinding, shrieking wail of metal and magic as the lockdown sequence engaged. The sound came from everywhere at once: the walls, the ceiling, the very stones beneath the floor.

Brother Demos jerked upright, spinning toward the entrance.

The main doors slammed shut with a sound like thunder. Iron bars shot across them from recessed housings in the doorframe, sliding into place with precise, brutal efficiency. The windows followed—shutters dropping from above, locking mechanisms engaging with sharp *clicks* that echoed through the main hall.

Every exit. Every opening. Sealed.

The wailing continued for another three seconds, then cut off abruptly, leaving a ringing silence in its wake.

Cornelius hopped down from his desk and walked calmly toward the Herbaria Medica section.

Brother Demos stood frozen beside Shelf Seven, Row B. His hood had fallen back, revealing a thin face with wide, terrified eyes. He looked young—perhaps thirty. His hands were empty, but the canvas satchel hung heavy against his side.

"Good evening, Brother Demos," Cornelius said. His voice was perfectly level. Perfectly controlled. "I am Cornelius Drake, Head Librarian of Solterra Bay. You are currently in violation of library protocol, trespassing statute, and—I suspect—theft law. I have activated a Code Obsidian lockdown. The Town Watch has been notified and will arrive shortly. I suggest you remain exactly where you are."

Demos's mouth opened. Closed. Opened again. "I—this is a mistake—"

"The only mistake," Cornelius said, "was yours. In believing you could steal from my library without consequence."

"I did not steal anything!"

"Then you will not object to a search of your person and your bag."

Demos clutched the satchel closer. "You have no right—"

"I have every right. This is my library. You entered it after hours, without permission, and proceeded directly to the section from which a volume was recently stolen. Your behavior is consistent with that of a thief returning to the scene of his crime. Or perhaps"—Cornelius's gaze fixed on the satchel—"attempting to steal additional materials."

"No! I was only—I needed to check a reference—"

"At night. In secret. How convenient."

Demos backed up a step. His shoulders hit the bookshelf. A small volume wobbled but did not fall. Cornelius made a mental note to reshelf it properly once this unpleasantness was concluded.

"I have done nothing wrong," Demos said. His voice had gone thin and high. Panicked. "I am a scholar. I use this library regularly. I have every right to—"

"You have the right to use the library during operating hours, with proper check-out procedures, and under the supervision of library staff. None of which apply to your current situation." Cornelius sat back on his haunches, tail curled neatly around his feet. "Now. We can wait here in civilized silence for Captain Theo to arrive. Or you can make this easier on yourself and simply hand over the stolen materials now."

"I do not have any stolen materials!"

"Then you will not mind when the Watch searches you."

Demos's face had gone pale. He looked toward the sealed doors, then back to Cornelius. His hands knotted together. "This is... this is harassment. I will report you to the temple authorities. The head priest will—"

"The head priest will be very interested to learn that one of his scholars has been stealing rare botanical texts," Cornelius said smoothly. "I am certain he will want to discuss the matter with you. At length."

A sound came from the back of the library. Footsteps, rapid and irregular.

Zeph emerged from the Biography section, where he had apparently been shelving returns. His hair stuck up at odd angles, and he had changed into what he probably believed were Festival-appropriate clothes: a clean linen shirt the color of cream, trousers that did not bear fish scales, and a vest embroidered with small bronze beetles.

He stopped when he saw the barred doors. "Boss? What—did you just trigger the lockdown?"

"Yes."

"Why?"

Cornelius gestured toward Brother Demos with one wing. "I have apprehended our thief."

Zeph's gaze moved to the monk. Recognition flickered across his face. "That's him? That's the guy who stole—wait. Boss. What time is it?"

"Approximately nine bells."

"Nine—" Zeph's expression shifted from confusion to horror. "No. No, no, no. I'm supposed to meet Sophia at nine bells. At the fountain. We're going to watch the lantern lighting—"

"You will have to reschedule," Cornelius said. "We have a more pressing matter to address."

"But—Boss—I can't just—" Zeph gestured helplessly toward the sealed doors. "How long is the lockdown going to last?"

"Until the situation is resolved."

"How long is that?"

"As long as necessary."

Zeph looked like he wanted to argue. His hands moved through his hair, destroying whatever careful arrangement he had achieved earlier. "This is—okay. Okay. Can I at least—is there any way to send her a message? So she knows I'm not just standing her up?"

"The lockdown is total," Cornelius said. "No one enters or exits until I deactivate it."

"So I'm just stuck here."

"Yes."

"And Sophia is going to think I ditched her."

"That is unfortunate but irrelevant."

Zeph's jaw tightened. He shot a look at Brother Demos that was not entirely friendly, then crossed his arms and leaned against the nearest shelf. "Fine. Great. Perfect. This is exactly how I wanted tonight to go."

"Your romantic disappointments are noted," Cornelius said. "Now please be quiet. I am conducting an interrogation."

Before Zeph could respond, a new sound cut through the library: heavy, rhythmic pounding on the main doors.

"Town Watch!" a voice bellowed. "Open up!"

Captain Theo. Right on schedule.

Cornelius felt a small thrill of satisfaction. Everything was proceeding exactly as it should. He glided to the control panel and deactivated the lockdown sequence.

The iron bars retracted. The door locks disengaged with a series of sharp clicks. The main doors swung open.

Captain Theo Melas stood on the threshold, breathing hard. He wore his Watch uniform—leather armor over a practical tunic, a short sword at his belt, and a deeply annoyed expression. Behind him stood two junior Watch officers, both looking wary.

Theo's gaze found Cornelius. "Drake. What in the name of every reasonable law is going on?"

"Good evening, Captain," Cornelius said. "I have detained a suspect in an ongoing theft investigation. I require your assistance in searching his person and recovering stolen property."

Theo stared at him. "You triggered a Code Obsidian lockdown. For a *book theft*."

"Two book thefts, actually. And yes."

"Do you have any idea how many regulations that violates? Code Obsidian is for emergencies. Active threats. Not—" He gestured vaguely at Brother Demos, who had not moved from his position against the bookshelf. "Not scholars browsing after hours."

"He is not browsing," Cornelius said. "He is trespassing. And I have reason to believe he is carrying stolen materials."

Theo rubbed his face with both hands. He looked as though he had not slept in several days. "Reason to believe. Do you have evidence?"

"I have a pattern of behavior consistent with—"

"Evidence. Physical evidence. Witnesses. Something other than your*reasoning*."

Cornelius's scales prickled. "I observed him enter the library after hours and proceed directly to the section from which a volume was previously stolen. That is sufficient grounds for detention and search."

"That's grounds for asking him to leave," Theo said. "Not for locking down a municipal building and triggering a Watch emergency response."

"I am the Head Librarian. This is my library. I have the authority to—"

"You have the authority to manage the collection. Not to imprison scholars." Theo turned to Brother Demos. "You. What are you doing here?"

Demos had recovered some composure. His hands were still shaking, but his voice was steadier. "I came to check a reference for my research. I did not realize the library was closed. The door was unlocked."

"It was not unlocked," Cornelius said. "I was working in my office. You entered without announcing yourself and went directly to the restricted texts."

"I did not know you were here! I saw no lights in the front hall. I assumed—"

"You assumed incorrectly."

Theo held up one hand. "Everyone stop talking." He looked at Demos. "What's in the bag?"

"My research materials. Notes. Sketches. Nothing stolen."

"You will not object to showing me."

Demos hesitated, then slowly opened the canvas satchel and held it out.

Theo reached in and removed the contents one item at a time: A leather-bound notebook. A wooden case containing drawing pencils. A folded cloth that, when opened, revealed several dried plant specimens pressed between sheets of thin paper. A small magnifying glass. A stoppered ink bottle.

No brown leather journal with a pressed-flower cover.

Cornelius felt something cold settle in his chest.

"Anything else?" Theo asked.

"No," Demos said. "That is everything."

Theo checked the bag's interior, running his hands along the seams. Then he handed it back. "It's clean."

"He must have hidden it," Cornelius said. The words came out sharper than he intended. "He knew I was here. He concealed the stolen journal somewhere in the library before I could apprehend him."

"Did you see him hide anything?" Theo asked.


"No, but—"

"Did you see him carrying a brown leather journal when he entered?"

"I saw his satchel. He could easily have—"

"That is not an answer to my question." Theo's voice had gone flat. Bureaucratic. "Did you, with your own eyes, observe this man carrying or concealing the stolen journal?"

Cornelius's tail lashed. "No. But the evidence clearly indicates—"

"I need facts. Not patterns." Theo turned back to Demos. "Did you take anything from this library tonight?"

"No, sir."

"Have you ever taken anything from this library without proper check-out procedures?"

"No, sir."

"Do you have any knowledge of the stolen journal belonging to Dr. Anthea Floros?"

Demos blinked. "Dr. Floros's journal was stolen? I did not know. That is terrible. Her work is invaluable."

He sounded sincere. Concerned, even.

Cornelius's claws dug into the floor tiles. "He is lying. He approached Dr. Floros in the market. He questioned her about her research. He was seen fleeing this library with a brown leather book—"

"By whom?" Theo asked.

"By me."

"When?"

"Yesterday afternoon. During the Festival preparations."

"And did you stop him? Question him? Verify that the book he carried was actually stolen property?"

Cornelius went still.

No. He had not done any of those things. He had seen a gray-robed figure running with a book and immediately assumed it was Demos. Assumed it was Dr. Floros's journal. Assumed guilt.

The pattern had been so clear. The logic so obvious.

But he had not actually *verified* anything.

"I..." Cornelius's voice trailed off.

Theo waited.

"I did not stop him at that time," Cornelius said carefully. "I planned to confront him formally, with proper evidence and institutional support."

"So you triggered a lockdown instead."

"Yes."

Theo was silent for a long moment. Then he turned to Brother Demos. "You're free to go."

"What?" Cornelius's voice came out as a strangled hiss. "No. You must search the library. He has hidden the journal somewhere. I am certain—"

"You are not certain," Theo said. "You are guessing. And I am not tearing apart a library based on guesswork." He looked at Demos. "Go. Now. Before I change my mind."

The monk did not need to be told twice. He clutched his satchel to his chest and moved toward the door. As he passed Cornelius, his expression shifted—just for a moment. Fear melted away, replaced by something that looked almost like satisfaction.

A small, private smile.

Then he was gone, disappearing into the Festival-bright streets beyond.

Cornelius stared after him, scales rigid with disbelief.

Theo dismissed the two junior officers with a nod. They left, closing the library doors behind them. Then the captain turned his full attention to Cornelius.

"You just harassed a temple scholar," he said. His voice was quiet. Dangerous. "You imprisoned him using emergency protocols designed for active threats. You accused him of theft without evidence. You wasted Watch resources on a personal vendetta. Do you understand how many laws you just violated?"

"He is the thief," Cornelius said. But his voice had lost its certainty. "The pattern—"

"Is not evidence. And even if it were, you do not have the authority to detain and search citizens on suspicion alone. You are a librarian. Not a Watch captain. Not a magistrate. You catalog books. You do not arrest people."

Each word landed like a physical blow.

Cornelius's claws scraped against the tile. "I am the Head Librarian. I have a responsibility to protect—"

"You have a responsibility to follow the law," Theo said. "Which you just failed to do. Spectacularly." He pulled a small notebook from his belt and began writing. "I am officially documenting this incident. If you pull something like this again, I will have you charged with unlawful imprisonment and misuse of emergency systems. Do I make myself clear?"

Cornelius could not speak. His throat had closed around the words.

Theo finished writing and returned the notebook to his belt. "Stay out of Watch business, Drake. If you have evidence of an actual crime, bring it to me. Through proper channels. Like a civilized citizen." He turned toward the door, then paused. "And for the record? I was actually planning to help you with this case. Dr. Floros came to me this morning. I was going to interview Brother Demos tomorrow, officially, with a proper warrant. But you just destroyed any chance of that. Congratulations."

He left.

The library doors closed behind him with a soft, final click.

Silence settled over the main hall.

Cornelius stood very still, staring at the space where Brother Demos had stood. Where the thief—the suspect—the *innocent scholar*—had smiled at him before walking away.

Behind him, Zeph made a strangled sound. "Boss, I—look, I have to—Sophia is waiting, and if I run I might still catch her before she leaves—"

"Go," Cornelius said. His voice came out flat. Empty.

"Are you sure? Because I can stay if you need—"

"Go."

Zeph hesitated for one more second. Then he bolted for the door.

Cornelius listened to his footsteps fade into the Festival noise beyond. Listened to the laughter and music and celebration happening in the streets outside. Listened to the awful, ringing silence inside his library.

He had been so certain.

The pattern had been perfect. Brother Demos requesting botanical texts. The timeline aligning. The hooded figure in the alley. The brown leather book. Every piece of evidence pointing in the same direction.

But he had been wrong.

Or—no. Not wrong. Incomplete. He had not been wrong about the pattern. He had simply... overlooked something. Some piece of the puzzle that did not fit the neat, logical framework he had constructed.

The borosilicate glass. The expensive perfume. Kyriakos Vlahos at the Seacliff Villa.

Anomalies. Details that did not align with a poor temple scholar.

Details he had dismissed because they complicated the simple, elegant solution.

Cornelius turned slowly and looked at his desk. At the investigation notes still spread across the blotter in their careful arrangement.

All that work. All that certainty.

And he had just humiliated himself in front of Captain Theo. Harassed an innocent scholar. Triggered an emergency lockdown for nothing.

The great investigator. The brilliant logician.

A fool.

Cornelius walked back to his desk. He gathered up the notes, one sheet at a time, and placed them in a neat stack. Then he picked up his pen and wrote a single word across the top page:

*WRONG.*

He stared at it for a long moment.

Then he climbed into his chair, folded his wings carefully against his sides, and sat alone in his perfectly ordered library, listening to the Festival celebrate outside while the weight of his failure pressed down on his scales like a physical thing.

Somewhere out there, Dr. Floros's journal was still missing. The real thief was still free. And Cornelius had just destroyed any credibility he might have had to solve the case.

The Hunt, it seemed, was over.

# Chapter 6

"You look terrible," Cornelius said.

Zeph made a sound that was half groan, half whimper. He had shown up at the library precisely on time—a minor miracle—but appeared to have slept in his Festival clothes. The cream linen shirt bore suspicious wrinkles. His hair stuck up at angles that defied both gravity and sanity. Dark smudges shadowed his eyes.

"Thank you, Boss. That's very encouraging."

"I am merely observing fact." Cornelius adjusted his spectacles and studied his assistant with clinical detachment. "Did you locate Sophia after the... incident?"

"No." Zeph's hands moved through his hair, making the situation worse. "She waited at the fountain for half an hour. Then she left. Her friend Callista told me. In great detail. About how disappointed Sophia was. And how I'm 'unreliable.' Which is rich, coming from someone who—" He stopped, shook his head. "Never mind. Where are we going?"

"The Festival Pavilion."

Zeph stopped walking. "The what?"

"The temporary structure erected in Harbor Square for visiting merchants and artists during Festival season." Cornelius continued down the library steps without breaking stride. "I require access to Kyriakos Vlahos. According to Nephele, he is staying at the Seacliff Villa, but my inquiries this morning revealed he has established a commercial presence at the Pavilion. We will find him there."

"We're investigating Kyriakos?" Zeph hurried to catch up. "I thought you said he was irrelevant. A coincidence."

Cornelius's tail twitched. He had spent most of the night reassessing his notes. The word *WRONG* still sat at the top of his desk blotter, accusatory in its simplicity.

Captain Theo had demanded evidence. Facts, not patterns.

Very well. Cornelius would provide facts. He would interview every possible suspect with methodical thoroughness. He would eliminate variables until only the truth remained.

He would *not* make assumptions.

Even if it meant wasting time on a pompous celebrity perfumer who almost certainly had nothing to do with the theft.

"I am clearing the board," Cornelius said. "Brother Demos remains the most logical suspect, but I failed to verify certain details before taking action. I will not repeat that mistake. Therefore, I am conducting formal interviews with all individuals who had proximity to the crime scene or motive to acquire rare botanical knowledge."

"So... everyone?"

"Everyone relevant."

Zeph rubbed his face. "This is because Theo yelled at you, isn't it?"

"Captain Theo did not yell. He delivered a professional reprimand regarding procedural overreach." The words tasted like ash. "Which was, technically, warranted."

"You're actually admitting you were wrong?"

"I am admitting I was *incomplete*." Cornelius kept his gaze fixed forward. "There is a difference."

They walked in silence for a block. The morning streets were already crowded with Festival activity. Vendors arranged displays of honey cakes and candied nuts. Musicians tuned instruments in doorways. Someone had strung paper beetles from the awnings, their wings catching the breeze.

Cornelius ignored all of it. His mind was occupied with the problem at hand.

Kyriakos Vlahos. Celebrity perfumer. Present at the Seacliff Villa during the relevant timeframe. Connected to the synthetic musk scent detected at the crime scene.

But also: wealthy, famous, and completely visible. Would such a person risk personal involvement in petty theft?

Unlikely.

Still. Facts, not patterns. He would verify the man's alibi and eliminate him properly.

The Festival Pavilion came into view as they rounded the corner into Harbor Square.

Cornelius stopped.

"Oh," Zeph said. "That's... new."

The Pavilion dominated the square. It was a temporary structure—ostensibly—but clearly built by people with more money than aesthetic sense. Wooden posts supported a peaked canvas roof dyed in garish stripes of purple and gold. Lanterns hung from every beam, unlit now but clearly intended for dramatic evening effect. The entire thing sprawled across what had been open plaza, transforming public space into a maze of vendor stalls and display tables.

Noise poured from the interior. Voices haggling, laughing, calling out prices. The clatter of wooden crates being moved. Music from somewhere deep inside—a flute attempting to compete with the general chaos and losing badly.

Cornelius's scales prickled with distaste.

"Come on," he said.

They entered the Pavilion.

The interior was worse. Stalls crammed together in uneven rows, their wares spilling onto shared tables. Silks here, ceramics there, jewelry displayed on velvet cloths beside baskets of dried figs. The air smelled of roasted nuts and woodsmoke and something sharp that made Cornelius's nostrils flare.

Oil. Perfume oil.

He followed the scent deeper into the Pavilion, weaving between customers and stepping over crates. Zeph trailed behind, looking increasingly miserable.

"Boss, if this takes too long, I need to—I promised I'd try to find Sophia at the tile workshop later, and if I'm late again—"

"Then do not be late." Cornelius spotted a stall ahead draped in cream-colored silk. Glass bottles gleamed on tiered shelves. "We are here."

The stall was larger than the others, positioned in a prime corner location with space for customers to browse comfortably. The display was artful: bottles arranged by color, from pale amber to deep violet. Small brass plaques identified each scent. Labels written in elegant script.

And standing behind the central table, speaking to a well-dressed customer, was Kyriakos Vlahos.

He was exactly what Cornelius had expected. Satyr-kin, with the characteristic elegance of that bloodline. Tall and lean, with dark hair swept back from a high forehead. His clothes were expensive—tailored silk the color of slate, with subtle embroidery at the cuffs. Small horns curved back from his temples, polished to a gleam.

Handsome, if one liked that sort of thing.

Cornelius did not.

The perfumer finished his conversation with the customer—a transaction involving a small crystal bottle and an obscene amount of coin—and looked up as Cornelius approached.

His expression shifted. Surprise, then recognition, then something that looked like amusement.

"Well," Kyriakos said. His voice was smooth. Cultured. The kind of voice that had never needed to shout to be heard. "A Library Dragon. In my humble stall. To what do I owe this unexpected honor?"

Cornelius sat back on his haunches and fixed the perfumer with a level stare. "I am Cornelius Drake, Head Librarian of Solterra Bay. I have questions regarding your presence in the harbor district two evenings ago."

"Questions." Kyriakos's smile did not quite reach his eyes. "How delightfully official." He gestured to the stall around them. "As you can see, I am engaged in commerce at the moment. Perhaps you could return during a less busy time?"

"This will not take long."

"I am quite certain it will not." The perfumer leaned against his display table, casual and unthreatened. "Very well. Ask your questions, Master Drake. I have nothing to hide."

Cornelius's ear-frills pricked forward. "You placed an order with Nephele of Nephele's Catch for fresh oysters, to be delivered to the Seacliff Villa on the evening of the Festival Eve. Correct?"

"I did. The oysters were excellent."

"What time did you receive the delivery?"

"Around seven bells, I believe. Perhaps slightly after. I did not check my timepiece."

"And your location prior to that delivery?"

Kyriakos raised one elegant eyebrow. "Am I a suspect in something, Master Drake?"

"I am conducting an investigation into a theft. I require alibis from all individuals with proximity to the crime scene."

"How thrilling. Very well." The perfumer straightened and brushed an invisible speck from his sleeve. "I spent the afternoon at the Harbor Master's office, arranging import permits for my materials. Thrilling bureaucracy, as I'm sure you can imagine. Then I returned to the Villa around six bells, bathed, changed, and received a delivery of oysters from a rather efficient fisherwoman. After that, I had dinner. Alone. With an excellent wine. I retired early, as I had business to attend to the following morning."

"What sort of business?"

"The acquisition of rare materials for my craft." Kyriakos gestured to the bottles behind him. "I am a perfumer, Master Drake. My work requires access to unusual substances. Festival season provides opportunities to meet with specialized traders who do not typically visit Solterra Bay."

"What sort of substances?"

The perfumer's smile sharpened. "Are you interested in the art of perfumery? How unexpected."

"I am interested in facts."

"Facts. Of course." Kyriakos moved along his display, trailing one finger across the glass bottles. "Yesterday morning, I met with a trader from the southern isles who specializes in ambergris. A rare material, essential for certain high-end formulations. The transaction took place at the docks, around eight bells. Quite early, but he was departing on the morning tide."

Eight bells. Dr. Floros had returned to her room and discovered the theft around the same time.

Which meant Kyriakos had been at the docks. The opposite end of town from the Sea View Guest House.

An alibi. Easily verified.

Cornelius made a mental note to confirm the details with the Harbor Master later. But the timeline fit. Nephele had delivered oysters at seven bells. Kyriakos claimed to have been at the Villa that evening. And the following morning, he had been conducting business elsewhere.

It was thin. But it held together.

"Did you leave the Seacliff Villa at any point during the night?" Cornelius asked.

"No. Why would I?"

"The Sea View Guest House is accessible from the Villa via the service alley behind the harbor buildings."

Kyriakos laughed. It was a light, musical sound. Utterly genuine. "Are you suggesting I climbed through alleyways to burglarize a guest house? Master Drake, I am a perfumer, not a thief. If I required something from a scholar staying at a modest establishment, I would simply purchase it. Legally. Like a civilized person."

The disdain in his voice was palpable.

Cornelius's claws scraped against the wooden floorboards. "What do you know about Dr. Anthea Floros?"

"Who?"

"A botanist. Currently staying at the Sea View Guest House."

"I have never heard of her."

"She is a leading expert on rare coastal plants."

"How nice for her." Kyriakos returned to his position behind the table. "I am afraid botany is not my area of expertise. I purchase my materials from specialized suppliers. I do not harvest them myself."

"But you have an interest in rare plants. For your perfumes."

"I have an interest in the *essences* derived from plants. There is a difference. I do not need to understand photosynthesis to appreciate the scent of jasmine." He picked up one of the bottles and held it to the light. The liquid inside gleamed pale gold. "My craft is art, Master Drake. Not science."

There was something about the way he said it. A casual dismissal of scholarship. Of knowledge for its own sake.

It rankled.

Cornelius's tail lashed once. "Have you visited the Solterra Bay Library during your stay in town?"

"No. I have no need of libraries."

"No interest in botanical texts? Field guides? Historical records of plant cultivation?"

"None whatsoever. I leave such things to scholars." Kyriakos set the bottle down with deliberate care. "I create beauty, Master Drake. I do not catalog it."

The scent hit Cornelius then. Properly, fully, now that he was paying attention.

It rolled off Kyriakos in waves. Synthetic musk. Heavy and sweet, with undertones of amber and something darker. Expensive. Overwhelming.

The exact scent from Dr. Floros's room.

Cornelius went very still.

The perfume. Kyriakos No. 5. The signature fragrance.

Of course Kyriakos Vlahos smelled like his own creation. He was wearing it. Advertising it. The man was a walking advertisement for his brand.

The scent at the crime scene meant nothing. It only confirmed that Kyriakos's perfume was popular. Prevalent. Exactly as Cornelius had theorized before.

Someone at the guest house wore it. Or had encountered someone who wore it. Or purchased a bottle from a merchant. Or passed Kyriakos himself in the street during Festival.

The scent was ubiquitous. It proved nothing.

Cornelius forced his scales to settle. "One final question. Did you approach Dr. Floros at any point during the Festival? In the market, perhaps? Or near the harbor?"

"I have already told you I do not know who she is."

"You are quite certain."

"Master Drake." Kyriakos's patience appeared to be wearing thin. "I have answered your questions with remarkable tolerance, given that you have provided no legal justification for this interrogation. I have an alibi for the time in question. I have no knowledge of your missing botanist or her work. I have no connection to your library. Is there anything else, or may I return to my actual business?"

Cornelius studied him. The polished horns. The expensive clothes. The casual arrogance of someone who had never needed to justify his existence to anyone.

This was not a thief.

This was a wealthy fool who sold overpriced perfume to people with more money than sense.

The pattern did not fit. The motive was absent. The alibi held.

"That will be all," Cornelius said.

"How relieved I am." Kyriakos turned away, already dismissing him.

But then he paused. Looked back. Smiled.

"Although, while you are here, Master Drake, I do have a proposition for you."

Cornelius's ear-frills flattened. "I am not interested in purchasing perfume."

"Not perfume. Books." Kyriakos leaned against the table again, his expression shifting to something that looked almost... calculating. "I have heard certain things about the Solterra Bay Library. Rare texts. Unusual collections. Items not found in larger institutions."

"The library's collection is not for sale."

"Everything is for sale, Master Drake. It is simply a matter of price." He gestured to his stall. "I am a collector, you see. Not just of scents, but of beauty in all its forms. First editions. Illuminated manuscripts. Works of botanical art. I would be willing to pay quite generously for access to certain... specialized volumes."

Cornelius's claws dug into the floorboards. "The library is a public institution. Its collection serves scholarly research and community education. It is not a private hoard for wealthy dilettantes."

"Such passion. How quaint." Kyriakos's smile sharpened. "But consider, Master Drake. Libraries require funding, do they not? Maintenance. Acquisitions. Salaries for staff." His gaze flickered to Zeph, who had been standing silent and increasingly uncomfortable throughout the conversation. "I could ensure your institution prospers. All I ask in return is... cooperation."

"The answer is no."

"You have not even heard my offer."

"I do not need to hear it. The library's collection is not for sale. Not to you. Not to anyone." Cornelius turned away, tail lashing. "Come, Zeph. We are leaving."

Behind him, Kyriakos laughed. "A pity. I do so appreciate beautiful things. Even when they smell of old paper and dust."

The words were designed to sting.

They succeeded.

Cornelius did not respond. He walked out of the stall, through the chaos of the Pavilion, and back into the relative sanity of Harbor Square. Zeph followed, silent until they were well clear of the structure.

"Boss," he said carefully. "That scent. The one Kyriakos was wearing. That was—"

"His signature perfume. Yes. I am aware."

"But at the guest house, you said—"

"I said the scent was present at the crime scene. Which it was. Because Kyriakos No. 5 is currently one of the most popular fragrances in Solterra Bay. Its presence proves nothing except that someone in the vicinity wore expensive perfume."

Zeph was quiet for a moment. "He was wearing a lot of it."

"He is a perfumer. Of course he was."

"Right. Yeah. That makes sense."

They walked back toward the library. Cornelius's mind was already moving to the next item on his list. Kyriakos Vlahos: eliminated. Alibi confirmed. Motive absent. Connection to the theft: nonexistent.

Which left Brother Demos.

Again.

The pattern kept returning to the same conclusion. The temple scholar with proven interest in rare plants. The hooded figure in the alley. The brown leather book.

Captain Theo had demanded evidence. Very well. Cornelius would find evidence. He would investigate properly this time. Methodically. Without assumptions.

But the fundamental logic remained unchanged.

Brother Demos was the thief.

Cornelius was certain of it.

Behind him, unnoticed, Zeph glanced back toward the Festival Pavilion. His expression was troubled. But when Cornelius asked if something was wrong, the boy simply shook his head and said he was tired.

They returned to the library in silence.

Cornelius went directly to his desk. He pulled out his investigation notes—the ones marked *WRONG* in large letters—and added a new entry.

*Kyriakos Vlahos: Eliminated. Alibi confirmed (ambergris transaction, 8 bells, docks). No motive. No connection to victim or stolen materials. Scent presence explained by commercial popularity of product. Suspect cleared.*

He underlined the final word twice.

Crossed Kyriakos's name off the list.

And returned his attention to the only suspect who mattered.

The Hunt, despite Captain Theo's skepticism and Cornelius's recent humiliation, was not over.

It was simply more complicated than he had initially believed.

But complexity could be unraveled. Patterns could be verified. Evidence could be found.

Cornelius Drake was a librarian. He specialized in organization, categorization, and the systematic arrangement of information.

He would solve this case.

Properly this time.

He picked up his pencil and began drafting questions for his next interview. Brother Demos might be protected by temple law, but there were other ways to gather information. Other sources. Other patterns to explore.

The journal was still missing. Dr. Floros's once-in-a-lifetime research opportunity was still at risk. And somewhere in this town, a thief still walked free.

Cornelius would find them.

Even if it meant interviewing every scholar, merchant, and Festival visitor in Solterra Bay.

Order would be restored.

He was certain of it.

# Chapter 7

# Chapter 7

The roof tiles were cold. Also uneven. Also covered in a fine layer of salt residue that left grit under Cornelius's claws.

He had been crouched behind the decorative cornice of the Harbor Master's building for approximately twenty-three minutes, watching the Festival Market below with the patient stillness of a gargoyle. A very uncomfortable, very annoyed gargoyle who had better things to do with his evening than supervise a sixteen-year-old's romantic endeavors.

But here he was.

Zeph stood near the fountain—the same fountain where Sophia had apparently waited in vain the previous night—shifting his weight from foot to foot. He had changed clothes again. The cream shirt from this morning was gone, replaced by something dark blue that did not bear any visible stains. His hair had been wrestled into submission with what looked like excessive amounts of pomade. He kept touching it. Then stopping himself. Then touching it again.

Cornelius's tail twitched in sympathetic exasperation.

The boy was a disaster.

Below, the Festival Market sprawled across Harbor Square in its full evening glory. Lanterns hung from every stall and awning, their warm light competing with the temporary enchantments that made certain vendor displays glow with soft colors. Music drifted from three different directions at once—a flute, a stringed instrument Cornelius could not identify, and someone attempting to sing while extremely drunk. The crowd moved in chaotic currents between the stalls, laughing and haggling and consuming an alarming quantity of fried food.

Cornelius had positioned himself with a clear view of the central fountain and the tile artist's stall on the market's western edge. From this elevation, he could observe without being observed. Track movement. Note behavioral patterns.

And, if necessary, intervene if Zeph did something catastrophically stupid.

He told himself this was purely investigative. Sophia Doukas was the last name on his revised suspect list. Daughter of the Doukas tile guild. An artist with access to expensive materials and wealthy clients. She had been near the Sea View Guest House the morning after the theft—sketching on that terrace, close enough to have heard or seen something relevant.

She required elimination from the investigation.

That was the official justification.

The unofficial truth, which Cornelius would not acknowledge even to himself, was that Zeph had looked genuinely anxious when he left the library earlier. Not his usual casual nervousness. Something deeper. More fragile.

And Cornelius had already cost him one meeting with this girl.

So. Here he was. On a roof. Freezing his scales off. Watching a date.

For investigative purposes.

Obviously.

Movement near the fountain. A young woman approached, her silhouette resolving into familiar features as she stepped into a pool of lantern light.

Sophia Doukas.

Cornelius's vision sharpened. She was shorter than Zeph by several inches, with dark hair pulled back in a practical braid. She wore an artist's apron over her dress—canvas, stained with what looked like tile glaze and ground pigment. Her hands moved constantly, either adjusting the strap of the leather satchel across her shoulder or gesturing as she spoke.

Zeph straightened when he saw her. Then slouched. Then straightened again, as if he could not decide which posture conveyed the appropriate level of casual confidence.

Cornelius resisted the urge to put his face in his claws.

"You came," Zeph said. His voice carried clearly in the evening air.

"I said I would." Sophia stopped a polite distance away. Not cold. Not warm. Evaluating. "Callista said you were looking for me earlier."

"Yeah. I mean, yes. I wanted to—about last night—I am sorry. I did not mean to—" Zeph stopped, took a breath, tried again. "There was an emergency at the library. My boss triggered a lockdown. I got trapped inside."

"A lockdown." Sophia's tone suggested skepticism.

"Code Obsidian. Full magical seal. No one in or out." Zeph gestured vaguely toward the library district. "Ask anyone at the Watch. Captain Theo had to respond personally. It was a whole thing."

Sophia studied him for a moment. Then her expression softened slightly. "That sounds... complicated."

"It was." Zeph's shoulders relaxed a fraction. "But it is over now. And I am here. Now. On time."

"You are."

"So. Um." Zeph gestured toward the market. "Do you want to... I mean, we could look at the stalls? Or get something to eat? There is a vendor selling those honey cakes you mentioned—"

"Actually," Sophia said, "I wanted to show you something. If you are interested."

"Yes. Absolutely. Whatever you want."

She smiled then. Small but genuine. "Come on."

They moved into the market together, navigating between stalls with the ease of locals who knew how to avoid the worst of the crush. Cornelius tracked their progress from above, moving along the roofline with the silent precision of a hunting cat.

His investigative instincts catalogued details automatically. Sophia carried herself with confidence. No furtive glances. No nervous energy. Her satchel hung loose at her side, bulging with what looked like sketchbooks and tools but not obviously concealing anything journal-sized.

She led Zeph to a stall near the market's edge, away from the densest foot traffic. The display table held samples of decorative tiles arranged in careful patterns. Each piece caught the lantern light differently—some with glossy glazes, others with matte finishes that seemed to absorb illumination entirely.

"This is my guild's stall," Sophia said. "Well. My family's part of the guild. We specialize in light-reactive glazes."

Zeph leaned closer, examining the tiles. "They change color?"

"Not exactly. They interact with different wavelengths of light. See this one?" She picked up a tile with a pale blue glaze. "In direct flame-light, it looks almost white. But under moon-glow or enchantment-light, the blues intensify. It is about understanding refraction. Particle suspension in the glaze matrix."

"That is..." Zeph touched the tile's edge carefully. "That is really complicated."

"It is science pretending to be art." Sophia set the tile down and selected another—this one a deep amber that seemed to glow from within. "Or art pretending to be science. I am not sure which."

"Can you do both?"

She looked at him. Something shifted in her expression. "Most people do not ask that."

"Why not?"

"Because they assume art and science are opposites. That you have to choose." She returned the amber tile to its place. "But my guild has been making light-reactive glazes for three generations. The chemistry is what makes the beauty possible. You cannot separate them."

"Like books," Zeph said.

Sophia tilted her head. "How?"

"The library. Boss—my boss, Cornelius—he is always going on about how the binding affects the longevity of the text. And the paper chemistry. And the ink composition. All this science stuff that makes the words last." Zeph gestured vaguely. "I used to think he was just being difficult. But then I saw him restore a water-damaged manuscript. And the way he talks about it... it is not just fixing a book. It is understanding how all the pieces work together. Paper and thread and glue and magic."

Up on the roof, Cornelius went very still.

The boy had been listening.

Sophia smiled. A real smile this time, reaching her eyes. "Chaos and glass."

"What?"

"Something my mother says. The art is in balancing chaos and glass. The chaos of the kiln—heat and time and chemical reactions you can only partially control. And the glass itself, which wants to be ordered. Stable. Clear." She picked up another tile, running her thumb along its edge. "You have to respect both."

"I like that," Zeph said quietly.

They stood together in comfortable silence for a moment, examining tiles. The market noise continued around them—haggling and laughter and music—but the space between Sophia and Zeph had developed its own quieter atmosphere.

Cornelius observed from above, his analytical mind processing the interaction. This was not the behavior of a criminal. Sophia's body language was open. Her conversation genuine. She showed no signs of deception or evasion.

But patterns could be misleading. He had learned that lesson recently.

Facts. He needed facts.

"Can I ask you something?" Zeph said.

"Of course."

"The perfumer. Kyriakos Vlahos. Do you know him?"

Sophia's expression changed immediately. The warmth drained from her face, replaced by something sharper. "Everyone knows him. Why?"

"He came to the library this morning. Had a conversation with Cornelius. It was... weird."

"Weird how?"

"He offered money. For access to rare books. Like he wanted to buy them. Or borrow them privately." Zeph's hands moved through his hair, disrupting the pomade's work. "Cornelius refused. Obviously. But the whole thing felt wrong. Like Kyriakos was used to people saying yes."

"He is." Sophia set down the tile with deliberate care. "My family has dealt with him before. Three years ago, my uncle developed a new iridescent glaze formula. Something no one else had managed—a finish that shifts through seven different colors depending on viewing angle. Completely revolutionary."

"What happened?"

"Kyriakos commissioned a private batch. Paid well. Signed a contract agreeing the formula would remain proprietary to our guild." Sophia's jaw tightened. "Six months later, a competitor in Khariton started producing tiles with an almost identical finish. Turns out Kyriakos had sketched the process while visiting our workshop. Took notes on the materials and firing temperatures. Then sold the information to the highest bidder."

"That is—he cannot do that. That is theft."

"It is. But proving it legally is complicated. Trade secrets. Intellectual property. He claimed he was simply 'inspired' by our work." Sophia's fingers drummed against the table edge. "My uncle tried to take him to the guild arbitrators. But Kyriakos has more money than we do. Better lawyers. The case went nowhere."

"That is horrible."

"It is business." Sophia's voice carried a bitterness that aged her. "He collects beautiful things. And he does not care who he hurts to get them."

Up on the roof, Cornelius's claws scraped against the tiles.

Kyriakos Vlahos. Thief of intellectual property. Seller of proprietary information to competitors.

A collector who did not care about consequences.

The perfumer had an alibi for the morning of the theft. His timeline had checked out. But what if he had not acted personally? What if he had commissioned someone else to acquire Dr. Floros's research? Hired a proxy to steal knowledge he could then sell to interested parties?

It was possible.

But it was also speculation. Pattern-building without evidence. Exactly the mistake Cornelius had made with Brother Demos.

He forced himself to remain still. To observe. To gather facts.

Below, Zeph and Sophia had moved away from the tile stall. They walked together through the market, stopping occasionally to examine vendor displays. Zeph bought two skewers of roasted vegetables from a cart. They ate while walking, the conversation continuing in fragments Cornelius could not quite hear over the ambient noise.

He followed from above, moving along the roofline with practiced silence. His wings remained folded tight against his sides—not for flight, but for balance as he navigated the uneven surfaces.

The couple turned down a quieter side street, away from the thickest market crowds. Sophia led them to a bench near a small plaza where someone had hung paper lanterns from the surrounding balconies.

"I was painting when it happened," Sophia said, picking up a conversation thread Cornelius had missed. "At the Widow's Perch. That cliff overlook on the southern point."

"When what happened?" Zeph asked.

"The theft you mentioned. Dr. Floros's journal." Sophia settled onto the bench, pulling her sketchbook from her satchel. "Everyone is talking about it. A visiting scholar, robbed during Festival. Poor woman."

Cornelius went absolutely still.

"You heard about that?" Zeph's voice had gone carefully neutral.

"My mother mentioned it. She knows someone at the Sea View Guest House." Sophia opened the sketchbook, flipping through pages. "It happened the morning after Festival Eve, right? I was at the cliffs from sunrise until almost noon. Trying to capture the way the light hits the rock face during morning hours. I am working on a series of tiles inspired by coastal geology."

An alibi.

Unprompted. Casual. Verifiable.

"Did you see anyone else there?" Zeph asked. "At the cliffs?"

"The hermit. Orestes. He yelled at me for getting too close to some tide pool." Sophia did not look up from her sketches. "Charming man. Very welcoming."

"He lives out there?"

"Apparently. In a cave or a shack or something equally uncomfortable." She found the page she wanted and turned the sketchbook toward Zeph. "Here. This is what I was working on."

Cornelius could not see the sketch from his position. But he could see Zeph's face as he examined it. The boy's expression shifted—surprise, then something like awe.

"This is really good," Zeph said quietly.

"Thank you."

"No, I mean—this is *really* good. The detail. The way you captured the texture of the stone." He traced a finger near the page's edge, careful not to touch the drawing itself. "It looks real. Like I could reach in and feel the rock."

"That is the goal." Sophia's voice had gone soft. "To translate the physical world into something two-dimensional but still... true."

"Like preserving it," Zeph said. "Keeping something that would otherwise be lost."

She looked at him then. Really looked, as if seeing him properly for the first time. "Yes. Exactly like that."

They sat together in the lantern-light, passing the sketchbook back and forth. Sophia explained her process. Zeph asked questions that were, Cornelius grudgingly admitted, actually intelligent. The conversation flowed naturally now, the earlier awkwardness dissolved.

On the roof above, Cornelius made his calculations.

Sophia Doukas had been at the Widow's Perch cliffs during the theft. Far from the Sea View Guest House. Witnessed by Orestes the hermit—admittedly not the most reliable source, but a witness nonetheless.

Her satchel contained sketchbooks and drawing tools. Pencils. Charcoal sticks. A small ruler. No brown leather journal with pressed flowers on the cover.

Cornelius's heat-sense confirmed it. He could detect the thermal signatures of everything in that bag from here. Paper gave off a distinctive pattern—cool and flat. Large volumes had more mass. More density.

No journal.

And her behavior displayed none of the markers he associated with deception. No evasiveness. No calculated misdirection. She had mentioned the theft casually, in the context of local gossip. She had provided an alibi without being asked.

She was innocent.

Pattern confirmed by evidence.

Dr. Floros's journal had been stolen between seven and nine bells on Festival morning. Sophia had been painting at the cliffs—a location that required at least an hour's walk from the harbor district. Even if she had somehow learned about the journal's existence and value, she could not have physically committed the theft.

Cornelius felt something unknot in his chest.

One more name crossed off the list.

Which left...

Brother Demos. Temple scholar with proven interest in botanical texts. Caught in the library after hours. Still the most logical suspect despite Captain Theo's skepticism.

And now, unexpectedly: Orestes. The hermit who lived at the cliffs. Who had been present near Sophia that morning. Who had access to tide pools and coastal plants. Who might have knowledge of rare botanical specimens.

A man who lived outside society's normal structures. Who operated without oversight.

Cornelius's mind began constructing a new pattern. Orestes could have learned about the Moon-Scented Orchid through his own observations of coastal flora. He might have known Dr. Floros was in town and targeted her specifically for the journal. A hermit would have climbing skills. Knowledge of back alleys and service routes.

It fit.

Almost.

But Cornelius had learned caution. Patterns were not evidence. Logic was not proof.

He would need to investigate Orestes properly. Gather facts. Verify the timeline.

Tomorrow.

Below, Zeph and Sophia had stood. They walked back toward the main market, still talking. The ease between them had solidified into something that looked almost like friendship. Perhaps more than friendship, based on the way Sophia's hand brushed Zeph's arm when she laughed.

Cornelius watched them disappear into the Festival crowds.

His work here was done.

Sophia: eliminated.

The suspect list: reduced to two.

He stood carefully on the roof tiles, shaking salt grit from his claws. His wings ached from being folded so long. His scales felt grimy. He wanted tea. And his desk. And the familiar comfort of his organized investigation notes.

But first, he needed to return to the library and update his records.

Facts, not patterns.

Evidence, not assumptions.

He would solve this properly.

Starting with Orestes the hermit.

Tomorrow.

Cornelius spread his wings and glided down from the roof, landing in a shadowed alley with practiced silence. The Festival noise covered any sound. No one saw a small bronze dragon slip through the back streets toward the library district.

Inside his mind, the investigation reshuffled itself. New priority. New focus.

A hermit who yelled at artists for approaching tide pools. Who lived alone at the cliffs. Who might know more about coastal plants than any temple scholar.

Cornelius's claws clicked against the cobblestones as he walked.

The Hunt had narrowed.

And he knew exactly where to look next.

# Chapter 8

# Chapter 8

The wind tried to murder him.

Cornelius clung to the limestone outcropping with all four sets of claws, wings folded tight against the gusts that wanted to peel him from the cliff face like old parchment. Salt spray coated his scales. His spectacles had fogged twice already. His tail wrapped around a twisted root for additional purchase.

This was undignified.

Also dangerous.

Also completely necessary, because Orestes the hermit lived at the very top of the Widow's Perch, apparently as a personal challenge to anyone foolish enough to seek him out.

Cornelius's wings ached. He had glided most of the distance from the library district, using the thermal currents that rose from the harbor. But the final approach required actual climbing. The cliff face was nearly vertical here, pocked with handholds that crumbled under pressure and slick with moisture from the constant spray.

He had not climbed like this in decades.

His shoulders would punish him for it later.

One more ledge. The summit was visible above—a flat expanse of weathered stone dotted with hardy scrub grass and twisted trees that had learned to grow sideways under the relentless coastal wind.

Cornelius dug his claws into a crack, tested his weight, and hauled himself upward.

His back leg slipped.

For one heart-stopping moment, he dangled by three limbs over a drop that would very definitely kill him. Library Dragons were many things. Durable against falls from great heights was not among them.

He scrabbled, found purchase, and pulled himself onto the ledge with a grunt of effort that no one—absolutely no one—could ever learn about.

The summit spread before him.

It was worse than he had imagined.

The Widow's Perch deserved its name. The promontory jutted out over empty air like an accusing finger, surrounded on three sides by sheer drops to the rocks and tide pools below. The stone here was pale gray, scoured smooth by centuries of wind. Patches of lichen clung to the surface in rust-colored smears. The scrub grass grew in defiant clumps, roots anchored in cracks barely wider than Cornelius's claws.

And at the far end, where the cliff face met a tumble of boulders, stood a structure that might generously be called a shelter.

It was made of driftwood. And stones. And what looked like dried kelp woven into some approximation of a roof. The whole thing leaned at an angle that suggested either architectural incompetence or a complete disregard for basic engineering principles.

Possibly both.

Cornelius approached cautiously, his scales prickling with awareness. The wind made it impossible to hear properly. Every sound was distorted, filtered through the constant rush of air and the distant crash of waves against stone far below.

"Orestes," he called. His voice barely carried. "I am Cornelius Drake, Head Librarian of Solterra Bay. I require a moment of your time."

No response.

The shelter remained silent.

Cornelius's ear-frills swiveled, tracking for movement. Nothing. Just wind and stone and the skeletal trees bending under the gusts.

He took another step forward.

"I am investigating a theft. You were present at this location two mornings past when—"

"I know why you are here, Lizard."

The voice came from behind him.

Cornelius spun, claws scraping stone.

A figure stood near the cliff edge. Exactly where there had been empty space a moment before.

Orestes.

The hermit was... difficult to describe. Human-shaped, certainly. But the edges blurred. His skin had the texture of bark—rough and ridged, with patterns that looked less like wrinkles and more like growth rings. His hair was not hair at all, but a tangle of thin branches and dried leaves that moved independently of the wind. His eyes were the color of deep moss, with no visible whites.

Dryad-touched, Cornelius's analytical mind catalogued. Significant integration. Possibly seventy percent plant matter.

The hermit wore robes that might once have been gray but had faded to the same color as the lichen on the stones. His feet were bare. His toes had roots.

Actual roots.

They extended into the stone itself, anchored in cracks Cornelius had not noticed before.

"You are Orestes," Cornelius said. It was not a question.

"I am the Thorn. The Watcher. The one who tends what should not be tended and guards what should not need guarding." The hermit's voice had layers—human speech overlaid with something that sounded like wind through leaves. "You are the Hoarder of Dead Words. The Keeper of Pressed Truths. The one who thinks knowledge lives in cages."

Cornelius's tail lashed. "I prefer 'librarian.'"

"Of course you do." Orestes moved closer. His roots withdrew from the stone with a sound like tearing fabric, then extended again with each step, re-anchoring. "The girl told me you would come. The one who paints stones. She said the Lizard was asking questions about thieves and scholars and stolen things."

"Sophia Doukas spoke to you?"

"She shouted at me after I shouted at her. A fair exchange." The hermit stopped three paces away, his moss-eyes fixed on Cornelius with unsettling intensity. "She was standing too close to the eastern pools. Disturbing the anemones. I informed her she was unwelcome."

"She mentioned that."

"Did she mention what I told her about the False Gardener?"

Cornelius went still. "No. She did not."

Orestes smiled. It was not a comforting expression. His teeth were wooden.

"Then you are here for answers you do not yet know to ask." The hermit turned and moved toward the cliff edge, roots sliding across stone. "Come, Lizard. See what has been violated."

Every instinct Cornelius possessed screamed that following a territorial hermit to the edge of a deadly precipice was a poor life choice.

But he had come here for information.

Facts, not patterns. Evidence, not assumptions.

He followed.

Orestes led him to a spot where the summit's edge curved inward, creating a small alcove sheltered from the worst of the wind. Below, tide pools spread across the exposed rock shelf, their surfaces reflecting the sky in broken fragments. Seaweed draped over boulders in dark ribbons. Small creatures moved in the shallow water—crabs and snails and things Cornelius could not identify from this height.

"There," Orestes said, pointing downward.

Cornelius peered over the edge, his claws digging into stone for stability.

At first, he saw nothing unusual. Just tide pools. Stone. The eternal cycle of water and rock.

Then he noticed the disturbance.

One of the larger pools—near the base of the cliff, accessible only at low tide—had been disturbed recently. The seaweed around its edges was torn. Rocks had been moved, creating a small cleared area. And in the center, barely visible from this angle, something had been scraped into the stone itself.

Measurement marks.

Someone had been documenting the pool's dimensions.

"When?" Cornelius asked.

"Three days past. In the hour before dawn." Orestes's branches rustled despite the relative calm of the alcove. "I heard the scraping. Came down to investigate. Found a man with tools. Measuring. Recording. Violating."

"Did you speak to him?"

"I told him to leave. He ignored me. Told me he was engaged in 'important scientific work' and that I should mind my own affairs." The hermit's voice had gone cold. Wooden. "I was going to throw him from the cliff. But he climbed away quickly. Like a spider. Unnatural."

Cornelius's mind raced. Someone measuring tide pools. Three days ago—the same timeframe as the theft. Someone with climbing skills and scientific interests.

Brother Demos?

"Describe him," Cornelius said.

"Human. Male. Wearing robes. Gray, like temple cloth. He smelled wrong."

"Wrong how?"

"Sweet. False-sweet. Like crushed flowers left to rot in sugar." Orestes turned his moss-eyes to Cornelius. "Like something beautiful turned poison."

Synthetic musk.

The perfume.

Kyriakos No. 5.

Cornelius's scales prickled. "You are certain about the scent?"

"I am of the earth, Lizard. I know every smell that belongs here and every smell that does not. That smell does not belong anywhere living things grow." The hermit's roots dug deeper into the stone. "It clings to death. To preservation. To things kept past their time."

The pieces clicked together in Cornelius's mind.

Brother Demos. Temple robes. Scientific interests. Present at the cliffs before dawn, measuring tide pools—exactly the kind of preparation someone would need to locate the Moon-Scented Orchid.

And wearing Kyriakos No. 5.

The same scent detected at Dr. Floros's room.

Pattern confirmed by evidence.

"Did he carry anything?" Cornelius asked. "A bag? A journal?"

"A satchel. Brown leather. He clutched it like a child clutches a stolen sweet." Orestes's branches stirred. "I assumed it held his measuring tools. His instruments of violation."

A brown leather satchel.

The journal.

Cornelius's certainty solidified. Brother Demos had been here, at the cliffs, with Dr. Floros's stolen research. The monk had taken the journal, learned about the Orchid's location, and come to survey the site himself. All the evidence pointed to—

"But he did not steal words, Lizard."

Cornelius blinked. "What?"

"The man you seek. The one who violated the pools." Orestes turned fully to face him, roots and all. "He did not steal pressed words. He did not take knowledge bound in dead tree flesh. He could not have."

"How do you know?"

"Because I know what he seeks. And it is not your hoard of dried truths." The hermit's wooden teeth showed again. "He seeks the living truth. The one that blooms once in fifty years. The Moon-Scented Orchid."

Cornelius went very still.

Orestes knew about the Orchid.

"You are aware of its existence," Cornelius said carefully.

"I am its Watcher. As my mother before me. As her mother before her." The hermit's voice carried the weight of roots going deep. "The Orchid is not for cages, Lizard. Not for books. Not for bottles or vials or any container made by hands that think beauty can be owned."

"Someone stole Dr. Floros's research journal. It contained maps to the Orchid's location."

"Then they sought to bottle truth. To cage beauty. To claim what cannot be claimed." Orestes's branches rattled like dry bones. "The False Gardener comes. I have seen the signs. Smelled his poisoned sweetness on the wind. He will try to take the bloom. To preserve it. To keep it past its time."

"Who is the False Gardener?"

"The one who wears death as decoration. Who collects beauty like your kind collects words. Who thinks rarity increases worth." The hermit leaned closer. "He smells of musk and lies, Lizard. And he will come when the moon is full and the tide is low and the Orchid opens its throat to sing."

Kyriakos.

The perfumer was the False Gardener.

The pattern had always been there. The collector who stole proprietary formulas. Who valued beauty only when it could be possessed. Who had the wealth to hire proxies, to commission theft, to—

"But this does not concern your investigation," Orestes said, interrupting Cornelius's racing thoughts. "You seek a thief of paper. I cannot help you with that. I do not read. I do not write. I would sooner burn pressed words than keep them."

Cornelius forced himself to focus. "The man at the tide pools. Are you certain he wore temple robes?"

"Gray cloth. Simple cut. Like monks wear."

"And the brown leather satchel—"

"—held his tools. His measuring devices. Not your stolen truth." Orestes's roots began withdrawing from the stone. "I am done with questions, Lizard. The wind grows restless. You should leave before it decides you are light enough to carry."

"Wait. The Orchid—when does it bloom?"

"Tomorrow night. When the moon is full and the tide retreats." The hermit was already moving away, back toward his impossible shelter. "The False Gardener will come then. If you wish to stop him, you must move quickly."

"How do you know he will come?"

Orestes paused. Looked back.

"Because he already has the map."

The words hung in the wind.

Cornelius's mind reeled.

Kyriakos had the journal. Or someone working for him did. The perfumer had commissioned the theft, hired Brother Demos—or someone dressed as a monk—to steal Dr. Floros's research and survey the cliffs.

Tomorrow night, Kyriakos would come to harvest the Orchid.

To bottle something that bloomed once every fifty years.

To own it. Possess it. Turn it into expensive perfume for people who would never understand its true value.

The same way he had stolen the Doukas guild's glaze formula. The same way he had tried to buy access to the library's rare texts.

A collector who saw beauty only as property.

Cornelius's claws scraped stone.

"You must tell Dr. Floros," Orestes called from near his shelter. "Tell her the Watcher keeps faith. Tell her the Orchid will bloom as it has always bloomed. But tell her to come quickly, if she wishes to witness it. Before the False Gardener bottles its soul."

Then the hermit stepped into his driftwood structure and seemed to merge with it entirely. Cornelius could no longer distinguish where plant ended and person began.

He was alone on the Widow's Perch.

The wind howled.

Cornelius turned and made his way back across the summit, his mind processing everything he had learned.

Facts:

Brother Demos—or someone wearing temple robes—had been at the tide pools three days ago, measuring and documenting. Wearing Kyriakos No. 5 perfume. Carrying a brown leather satchel.

The same perfume detected at Dr. Floros's room.

The same type of satchel Demos carried in the library.

But Orestes insisted the man at the cliffs was not stealing books. Could not have stolen books, because he sought the living Orchid, not pressed knowledge.

Which meant...

Cornelius stopped at the edge of the summit, where the climb down would begin.

Which meant the pattern was incomplete.

Again.

Brother Demos could have stolen the journal. He had the opportunity. The interest in botanical texts. The presence in the library after hours with a brown leather bag.

But the evidence was circumstantial. No proof. No direct observation. Just patterns that seemed to fit.

Patterns were not facts.

And Cornelius had already been wrong once.

Spectacularly, humiliatingly wrong.

His claws flexed against the stone.

The truth was maddeningly close. He could feel it. Someone had stolen Dr. Floros's journal. Someone with access to expensive perfume, climbing skills, and knowledge of coastal plants. Someone who had surveyed the cliffs and now planned to harvest the Orchid.

Kyriakos had motive. Wealth. A documented history of stealing intellectual property and rare materials.

But he had an alibi for the morning of the theft.

Brother Demos had opportunity. Interest. Suspicious behavior.

But no proven connection to Kyriakos or the Orchid harvest.

Unless...

Unless Demos was working for Kyriakos.

A hired agent. A proxy thief. Someone paid to steal the journal, scout the location, and report back to the perfumer.

It fit.

It fit perfectly.

But Cornelius had thought that before. About other suspects. Other patterns.

Facts, not patterns.

Evidence, not assumptions.

He needed proof.

He needed to search Brother Demos's quarters at the temple. To find the journal. Or correspondence with Kyriakos. Or anything that would transform suspicion into certainty.

But temple law protected monks' privacy. The head priest had refused Cornelius's earlier request for access. Captain Theo would never approve a search without concrete evidence—which Cornelius did not have.

Official channels had failed.

Which left unofficial channels.

Cornelius stood on the cliff edge, wings catching the wind, and made his decision.

He would break temple law.

Tonight, while the monks were at evening prayers, he would enter Brother Demos's quarters. He would search methodically. Document everything. Find the evidence that would prove the connection between Demos and Kyriakos.

It was illegal.

It was everything Captain Theo had warned him against.

It was the only way forward.

The wind gusted, nearly pushing Cornelius over the edge. He spread his wings and let it carry him into the air, gliding down from the Widow's Perch in a controlled descent that used the cliff's thermal currents.

His wings ached.

His scales were crusted with salt.

His mind was already planning the intrusion.

Tomorrow night, the Orchid would bloom.

Tomorrow night, Kyriakos would come to steal it.

But tonight, Cornelius would find proof.

And he would stop this. All of it.

Order would be restored.

Even if he had to break every rule he believed in to achieve it.

The library appeared below, its honey-colored stone a welcome sight after the hostile gray of the Perch. Cornelius angled toward it, adjusting his wings for landing.

He had a case to solve.

And less than two days to solve it.

The Hunt continued.

# Chapter 9

# Chapter 9

The library was silent.

Not the comfortable silence of after-hours solitude, when Cornelius could enjoy his tea and catalogs in peace. This was the heavy silence of three bells past midnight, when even the Festival crowds had retreated to their beds and the streets outside held only shadows.

Perfect.

Cornelius stood in his office, staring at the ventilation grate he had removed from the wall. The opening was approximately eighteen inches wide and twelve inches tall—dimensions he knew precisely because he had commissioned the ductwork himself forty years ago during the library's expansion.

Large enough for airflow.

Large enough, barely, for a determined Library Dragon.

He had shed his spectacles. They would only fog or catch on something in the tight spaces ahead. His investigation satchel remained on his desk—too bulky for the ducts. He carried nothing except his own scales, claws, and the burning certainty that Brother Demos's carrel held the evidence he needed.

The private study carrels occupied the library's eastern wing, accessible only to scholars who had applied for extended research privileges. Each carrel was a small private space—desk, chair, locked cabinet, shelf. The temple had secured Carrel Seven for Brother Demos three months ago, paying the standard fee for seasonal access.

Under normal circumstances, those carrels were inviolable. Scholars' privacy was protected by library policy and, in the case of temple monks, by religious law.

But these were not normal circumstances.

Cornelius had been barred from official channels. The head priest had refused his request. Captain Theo had explicitly ordered him to stay away from Brother Demos.

Which left unofficial channels.

The ventilation system.

Cornelius took a breath and climbed into the duct.

Immediately, he regretted it.

The space was cramped. His shoulders scraped the metal walls. His wings had to fold so tightly against his sides that the joints ached. The surface beneath his claws was slick with decades of accumulated dust and moisture residue.

This was undignified.

Also necessary.

He crawled forward, each movement producing soft scraping sounds that seemed impossibly loud in the enclosed space. His heat-sense painted the ductwork in shades of cool gray-blue—the metal had released the day's warmth hours ago. Ahead, the passage split into three directions. He took the center branch, following the route he had memorized from the building's original architectural plans.

The plans he had designed himself.

His library. His ducts. His investigation.

The metal creaked under his weight.

Cornelius froze.

The sound echoed through the ductwork, expanding and distorting until it sounded less like a small dragon in a ventilation shaft and more like the library itself groaning. He waited, counting heartbeats, listening for any sign that someone below had heard.

Nothing.

The library remained silent.

He continued forward, moving more carefully now. Slower. Each claw placed with deliberate precision to minimize noise.

This was harder than climbing Widow's Perch.

Different kind of danger. At the cliffs, the threat had been gravity and wind and the long fall to rocks below. Here, the threat was discovery. Humiliation. The complete destruction of what little credibility he had left after the Code Obsidian disaster.

If Captain Theo learned he had broken into the study carrels...

Cornelius pushed the thought away.

Facts, not patterns. Evidence, not assumptions.

And he would have evidence soon.

The duct angled downward. Cornelius braced his claws against the walls and let gravity pull him into a controlled slide. His scales scraped metal. Dust billowed around his snout, making his eyes water.

He emerged into a junction chamber—a larger space where multiple ducts converged around the library's central heating apparatus. The brass mechanism ticked softly, radiating gentle warmth that his heat-sense detected as a comfortable orange glow.

Four exits. He needed the southeastern branch. The one that fed air to the study carrel wing.

There.

Cornelius squeezed into the new passage. This duct was narrower than the last. His shoulders wedged against the walls. For a moment—one horrible, claustrophobic moment—he thought he might be stuck.

He twisted, scraping scales, and pushed through.

The passage opened slightly ahead. He could breathe again.

His joints protested. His wings ached from being compressed. His scales were coated in a layer of grime that would require a proper bath to remove.

But he was close now.

The duct ran parallel to the study carrel wing. Through the metal walls, Cornelius's heat-sense detected the faint thermal signatures of the rooms below. Most were cold—unoccupied. But one, three chambers ahead, held a warmer reading.

Not body-heat. Something else.

Recent use.

Carrel Seven.

Brother Demos's assigned space.

Cornelius crept forward until he reached the ventilation grate above the carrel. Through the metal slats, he could see the room below.

Small. Austere. A desk positioned beneath the grate. A single chair. A shelf holding perhaps two dozen volumes. A locked cabinet against the far wall.

And on the desk, barely visible in the ambient light filtering through the carrel's door, papers scattered in loose stacks.

Research materials.

Cornelius examined the grate. Standard installation. Four screws at the corners, designed for easy maintenance access. He had specified this design himself—vents that could be removed from inside the ducts for cleaning.

He extended one claw and carefully worked the first screw loose.

It turned smoothly. Silently.

The second screw proved more difficult. Forty years of salt air had corroded the threads. Cornelius applied pressure, felt the metal resist, then suddenly give way.

The screw dropped.

Cornelius's other claw shot out, catching it before it could fall through the grate and clatter onto the desk below.

His heart hammered against his ribs.

That had been close.

Too close.

He set the screw carefully in the duct beside him and continued working. Third screw. Fourth screw. The grate came free in his claws.

He set it aside and looked down into Brother Demos's carrel.

The drop was perhaps eight feet. Nothing dangerous for a dragon. But the landing would make noise. The desk was wooden—it would creak under his weight. The floor was tile—his claws would click.

He needed to be quieter than he had ever been.

Cornelius positioned himself at the opening, wings spread slightly for balance. He dropped.

His landing was nearly silent. A soft thump as his weight hit the desk. The wood creaked—barely audible. He froze, every sense alert for signs of discovery.

Nothing.

The library remained silent.

Cornelius exhaled slowly and looked around.

The carrel was exactly as he had glimpsed from above. Monk-sparse. Functional. The shelf held botanical texts—several he recognized from the library's own collection, checked out through legitimate channels. Others appeared to be personal volumes. Their spines were worn, well-used.

On the desk, papers covered nearly every surface. Handwritten notes in a cramped, precise script. Sketches of plant structures. Diagrams of coastal geography. Lists of tide schedules and lunar phases.

Research.

Obsessive, detailed research.

Cornelius's claws itched to organize it properly. The papers were not sorted by subject or date. No clear system. Just chaos masquerading as scholarship.

He forced himself to focus.

The journal. He was here for Dr. Floros's stolen journal.

Brown leather cover. Pressed flower design. Approximately eight inches by ten inches. Containing fifty years of botanical field notes and the map to the Moon-Scented Orchid.

Cornelius scanned the visible surfaces. Nothing matched that description.

He moved carefully around the desk, checking beneath papers. His heat-sense detected only the residual warmth of recent handling—someone had been working here earlier in the evening. The papers still held traces of body-heat from human fingers.

Not the desk, then.

The shelf?

Cornelius examined each volume systematically. Botanical Survey of the Southern Coast. Medicinal Properties of Rare Flora. Tide Pool Ecosystems and Their Inhabitants.

All legitimate texts. Nothing matching the stolen journal's description.

The locked cabinet.

Of course.

If Brother Demos had stolen the journal, he would not leave it visible. He would secure it. Hide it.

Cornelius approached the cabinet. Standard library issue. Simple lock. Designed to protect documents from casual interference, not from determined intrusion.

He extended one claw to the lock mechanism.

Then stopped.

Breaking the lock would leave evidence. Scratches. Damage. Proof that someone had been here. That would alert Demos. Potentially cause him to move the journal or destroy evidence.

No.

Cornelius needed to search without leaving traces.

He stepped back and reconsidered the space.

A small carrel. Limited hiding places. Desk—already searched. Shelf—already examined. Cabinet—locked and would show tampering.

Where else?

His gaze fell on the scattered papers again.

Hidden in plain sight.

The oldest trick in any monk's repertoire. Conceal the valuable thing among ordinary things. Make it disappear through obscurity rather than active hiding.

Cornelius returned to the desk and began examining the papers more carefully. Not reading content. Looking for physical characteristics. Texture. Weight. Age.

Most sheets were fresh vellum. Library standard. Available from the commons supply.

But beneath one stack, partially concealed by research notes about lunar cycles, his claw touched something different.

Leather.

Cornelius's breath caught.

He carefully moved the papers aside.

There.

A book.

Dark leather cover. Smaller than he had expected—perhaps seven inches by nine inches. The leather was worn, softened by age and handling. No visible title on the spine.

And pressed into the cover's center, faint but unmistakable even in the dim light, was a delicate flower design.

Cornelius's heart thundered.

This was it.

Dr. Floros's journal.

Hidden beneath Brother Demos's research. Exactly where a thief would keep stolen materials—close at hand for reference while maintaining plausible deniability if questioned.

Cornelius reached for it, then stopped.

He should verify. Open the cover. Confirm the contents matched Dr. Floros's description. Fifty years of field notes. Maps. Botanical observations.

His claw touched the leather.

The cover was cool. Smooth. The pressed flower design had been created by careful tooling—someone had carved the pattern directly into the leather surface, then treated it to preserve the impression.

Beautiful work.

The kind of craftsmanship that came from decades of practice.

Dr. Floros had mentioned her journal was a gift from a colleague. A master bookbinder who understood the needs of field researchers.

This matched.

Everything matched.

Cornelius wanted to open it. To see the maps. To confirm absolutely that this was the stolen journal.

But doubt whispered at the edge of his mind.

He had been wrong before.

Wrong about Brother Demos after the Code Obsidian incident. Wrong in his assumptions about patterns versus evidence.

What if this was not the journal?

What if it was simply another botanical text? A personal volume that happened to have a flower design and dark leather binding?

What if he was seeing patterns again instead of facts?

Cornelius's claw hovered over the book.

No.

This was different.

Brother Demos had been at the tide pools three days ago, wearing Kyriakos No. 5 perfume, carrying a brown leather satchel, measuring and documenting the exact location where the Moon-Scented Orchid would bloom. Orestes had witnessed it. Had described the monk's robes, the false-sweet scent, the violation of the sacred pools.

The perfume had also been present in Dr. Floros's room the morning of the theft.

The timeline matched. The evidence matched. The behavior matched.

This was the journal.

And finding it here, hidden among Demos's research papers, proved the monk was involved.

Either as the thief himself, or as an agent working for Kyriakos.

Vindication settled over Cornelius like a warm cloak.

He had been right.

His investigation had been correct from the beginning. Brother Demos was the key. The connection between the theft and the False Gardener's plan to harvest the Orchid.

But...

Cornelius stepped back from the desk, his analytical mind already moving ahead.

He could take the journal now. Remove it from Demos's carrel. Return it directly to Dr. Floros and be done with this entire mess.

Simple. Clean. Case solved.

But that would not restore his reputation.

Captain Theo would ask how he obtained the journal. Where he found it. What evidence connected it to Brother Demos.

And Cornelius would have to admit he had broken into the carrels illegally. Violated library policy. Ignored Theo's explicit orders.

The journal would be returned, yes. But Cornelius would face official reprimand. Possibly charges. Definitely humiliation.

No.

There was a better way.

Leave the journal here. In place. Exactly where he found it.

Tomorrow morning, during the library's public hours, Cornelius would arrange for a "discovery." Perhaps he could encourage Demos to bring research materials to the main desk for consultation. Or create a situation that required official library access to the carrel—inventory verification, maintenance inspection, something procedurally justifiable.

With proper witnesses present—Captain Theo, ideally, or at minimum other library patrons—the journal would be found in Demos's possession. The monk would be caught with stolen materials. Unable to deny. Unable to escape.

Public vindication.

Order restored through official channels.

Exactly as it should be.

Cornelius's tail swished with satisfaction.

He carefully repositioned the papers over the journal, recreating the exact arrangement he had found. Every sheet returned to its original placement. Every corner aligned precisely as it had been.

When he finished, the desk looked untouched. No evidence of intrusion. No sign that anyone had been here.

Perfect.

Cornelius turned his attention to escape.

The ventilation grate hung above him, eight feet up. Reachable by a jump, but awkward. He would need to climb—desk to chair to shelf to wall, using the shelving brackets as handholds.

He executed the climb in reverse of his entry. Shelf first. The bracket held his weight. He pulled himself up, wings spread for balance.

The grate beckoned.

One more push.

Cornelius sprang upward, caught the duct's edge with his front claws, and hauled himself into the ventilation shaft.

The grate needed to be replaced.

He maneuvered in the tight space, turning himself around. His wings protested. His shoulders ached. But he managed to position himself above the opening.

The grate went back into place. Four screws, turned carefully, silently, until they seated properly in their threads.

Done.

Carrel Seven looked exactly as it had before he arrived.

Undisturbed.

Innocent.

Containing the proof that would solve everything.

Cornelius crawled back through the ducts, retracing his path. The journey seemed easier now. Faster. His body remembered the route. His confidence overrode discomfort.

He had done it.

Infiltrated the carrel. Found the evidence. Left no trace.

Tomorrow, the journal would be recovered properly. Brother Demos would be exposed. Dr. Floros would have her research returned. The connection to Kyriakos would be investigated. The Orchid would be protected.

Order would be restored.

And Cornelius's reputation would be redeemed.

He emerged from the duct in his office, muscles trembling with exertion. Dust coated his scales. His joints protested every movement. He needed a bath. Tea. Sleep.

But first, he needed to document this.

Cornelius replaced the ventilation grate in his office wall, ensuring it looked undisturbed. Then he moved to his desk and opened his investigation ledger to the page labeled "Brother Demos."

His claw selected a fresh pen. Dipped in ink.

He wrote carefully:

*Evidence located. Dark leather journal with pressed flower design found concealed in Carrel Seven beneath research papers. Matches description of stolen materials. Location and concealment consistent with guilty knowledge. Recommend official recovery during public hours with witnesses present. Estimated timeline: tomorrow morning, nine bells.*

He dated the entry. Signed it with his official seal.

Then, after a moment's consideration, he turned back several pages to the entry he had made weeks ago. The one that had started this entire investigation.

*Secret Wonders: Field notes on medicinal herbs of the coastal regions.*

Status: MISPLACED.

He had written that to avoid embarrassment. To postpone the humiliation of admitting a book had been stolen from his library. Under his watch.

Now he understood.

Both books—*Secret Wonders* and Dr. Floros's journal—had been taken by the same person. Or persons. Brother Demos, working for Kyriakos. A conspiracy to gather botanical knowledge about rare coastal plants.

The Moon-Scented Orchid.

Everything connected.

Cornelius took a fresh pen and carefully drew a single line through "MISPLACED."

Above it, in his precise script, he wrote:

*STOLEN. Connection to Festival theft confirmed. See: Brother Demos investigation, current date.*

The word stood out on the page.

STOLEN.

Not lost. Not misplaced. Not misfiled.

Stolen.

And he had found it.

Well. Would find it. Tomorrow. Publicly. Properly.

Cornelius closed the ledger and set his pen aside.

His office felt warm. Safe. Familiar. His books surrounded him on every side—properly shelved, correctly catalogued, meticulously preserved.

His hoard.

His responsibility.

And tomorrow, he would prove that no one stole from his library without consequences.

No one violated order in Solterra Bay while Cornelius Drake stood watch.

He extinguished the lamp on his desk and moved to the small sleeping alcove behind the reference section. His scales still needed cleaning. His wings still ached. His joints would punish him in the morning for tonight's exertions.

But none of that mattered.

He had won.

The journal was found. The thief identified. The case—both cases—solved.

Tomorrow would bring vindication.

Order would be restored.

Cornelius curled into his sleeping cushion, tail wrapped around his body, and closed his eyes.

For the first time in days, he felt certain.

Absolutely, completely certain.

The Hunt was over.

# Chapter 10

# Chapter 10

The reading room had never looked more perfect.

Cornelius had spent the hour between dawn and eight bells arranging it precisely. The long oak table positioned beneath the main chandelier. Six chairs spaced at exact intervals. A carafe of water and glasses set on the sideboard—proper hospitality for what would be a formal proceeding.

His scales gleamed. He had bathed thoroughly after last night's excursion through the ventilation ducts, scrubbing away every trace of dust and grime. His spectacles were polished. His claws were clean.

Everything was ready.

Everything was perfect.

Captain Theo would arrive at nine bells, as requested in the message Cornelius had sent at first light. Dr. Floros was already present, seated at the far end of the table with her hands folded in her lap. She looked tired. Anxious. The weight of the stolen journal and the approaching Orchid bloom had worn on her these past days.

But that would end this morning.

Imelda Kassiani sat beside Dr. Floros, her ancient elf features composed in an expression of patient curiosity. She had arrived unexpectedly an hour ago, drawn by Cornelius's message to Anthea that "significant developments" had occurred. Her presence was both welcome and slightly uncomfortable—Imelda was the one person whose opinion of him truly mattered.

Today, she would see him vindicated.

Zeph hovered near the reference desk, shifting his weight from foot to foot. He had not asked questions when Cornelius instructed him to be present at nine bells. Just nodded and arrived on time, his hair only slightly less chaotic than usual.

Good lad.

Cornelius positioned himself at the head of the table and checked his internal chronometer. Three minutes to nine bells.

Brother Demos would arrive at any moment. Cornelius had sent word to the temple that his presence was required for "urgent library business regarding his carrel materials." Vague enough to avoid suspicion. Specific enough to compel attendance.

The monk would come.

And when he did, Cornelius would have witnesses. Official witnesses. Imelda. Captain Theo. Dr. Floros herself.

No more mistakes.

No more procedural errors.

This time, everything would be done properly.

The library's front door opened. Heavy footsteps echoed through the entrance hall.

Captain Theo appeared in the reading room doorway, his uniform slightly rumpled, his expression hovering somewhere between irritation and cautious curiosity.

"Drake," he said. "Your message indicated this was urgent. I hope you have not wasted Watch resources on another—"

"I have found Dr. Floros's stolen journal," Cornelius interrupted. His voice carried through the reading room with perfect clarity. "And I can prove who took it."

Silence.

Theo's expression shifted. The irritation faded, replaced by sharp attention. "You can prove this?"

"I can."

"With actual evidence? Not patterns or theories or—"

"With the journal itself," Cornelius said. "Hidden in the possession of the individual responsible for both thefts. Present in this very building."

Dr. Floros stood abruptly, her chair scraping against the tile. "You found it? My journal? Where?"

"Patience, Doctor." Cornelius kept his tone gentle but firm. "All will be revealed in moments. Captain, please take a seat. Brother Demos should arrive shortly."

Theo's jaw tightened. "Demos? You are accusing the monk again?"

"I am presenting evidence," Cornelius corrected. "As you requested. Facts, not patterns. The journal's location. Witness testimony. A complete chain of—"

The front door opened again.

Brother Demos entered the reading room, his gray robes dusty from the morning walk. He looked confused. Worried. His gaze darted between the assembled group—Theo in his Watch uniform, Dr. Floros standing rigid with hope, Imelda watching with her ageless calm.

"Head Librarian?" Demos's voice was thin. "Your message said there was urgent business regarding my carrel? Has something—"

"Please sit, Brother Demos." Cornelius gestured to the chair nearest the door. "This will not take long."

The monk sat slowly, his hands gripping the armrests. "I do not understand. What is this about?"

"Truth," Cornelius said simply.

He moved to the center of the room, positioning himself where everyone could see him clearly. His tail swished once—the only outward sign of the satisfaction humming through his scales.

This was the moment.

Four days of investigation. Humiliation. Doubt. Error.

All of it leading here.

To this.

"Four days ago," Cornelius began, "Dr. Anthea Floros reported the theft of her personal field journal from her room at the Sea View Guest House. The journal contained fifty years of botanical research and maps to the location of the Moon-Scented Orchid—a plant that blooms once every fifty years and is scheduled to bloom tomorrow night."

He paused, letting the timeline settle.

"Initially, I pursued several lines of inquiry. I investigated the guest house. Interviewed witnesses. Examined the scene of the theft. I also discovered that a volume from this library's own collection—*Secret Wonders: Field notes on medicinal herbs of the coastal regions*—had been stolen during the same period."

Brother Demos shifted in his chair. "I do not see what this has to—"

"Patience, Brother." Cornelius's voice sharpened. "I made errors in my early investigation. I allowed myself to see patterns instead of evidence. To make assumptions instead of verifying facts. Captain Theo correctly reprimanded me for procedural overreach."

Theo grunted but said nothing.

"However," Cornelius continued, "proper investigation yields proper results. Three days ago, a witness observed a man in monk's robes at the tide pools beneath Widow's Perch. The man was measuring and documenting the pools—precisely the kind of preparation necessary to locate the Moon-Scented Orchid. The witness noted the man carried a brown leather satchel and wore an expensive perfume. Kyriakos No. 5."

Dr. Floros's hands clenched. "The same perfume that was in my room."

"Indeed." Cornelius's gaze fixed on Brother Demos. "The same perfume detected at the scene of the theft. The same brown leather satchel you carry, Brother Demos. The same gray robes you wear now."

The monk's face had gone pale. "I—this is coincidence. Many monks wear gray robes. Many scholars carry satchels. I have never even heard of Kyriakos—"

"Last night," Cornelius said, his voice cutting through the denial, "I located Dr. Floros's stolen journal."

The room went silent.

Even the ambient sounds of the library seemed to stop. No creaking wood. No distant footsteps. Just perfect, absolute silence.

"Where?" Dr. Floros whispered.

Cornelius let the moment extend. Let the tension build.

Then: "Hidden in Carrel Seven. Your assigned study space, Brother Demos. Concealed beneath research papers on your desk. A dark leather journal with a pressed flower design. Exactly matching Dr. Floros's description."

"No." Demos stood, his chair scraping backward. "That is impossible. I have never—I would never—"

"Sit down, Brother." Theo's voice carried the weight of official authority. "You will have a chance to explain."

The monk sat, trembling.

Cornelius felt the Hunt's familiar rush. The predatory certainty. Everything aligned. Everything fit.

"The evidence is clear," he continued. "You stole Dr. Floros's journal to learn the Orchid's location. You surveyed the tide pools personally. You intended either to harvest the Orchid yourself or to provide the information to someone else—most likely Kyriakos Vlahos, who has both motive and means to commission such theft."

"This is insane," Demos said. His voice cracked. "I am a scholar. A monk. I would never—"

"Then explain," Theo interrupted, "why Dr. Floros's journal was found in your carrel."

"It was not! I do not have her journal. I have never seen her journal. I—"

"Denying the facts will not change them, Brother." Cornelius moved to the sideboard and retrieved a cloth-wrapped bundle he had prepared earlier. "I have not yet touched the journal itself. Dr. Floros should be the one to identify and reclaim her property."

He set the bundle on the table before her.

Dr. Floros stared at it, her hands shaking. "That is... that is really it? My journal?"

"See for yourself."

She reached for the bundle with trembling fingers. Pulled back the cloth.

The book lay revealed.

Dark leather cover. Smaller than Cornelius remembered—perhaps seven inches by nine inches. Worn edges. And pressed into the center of the cover, a delicate flower design.

Perfect.

Exactly as he had found it.

Dr. Floros touched the cover gently. Her eyes filled with tears. "I... this is..."

She opened the book.

Cornelius watched her face, expecting relief. Joy. Recognition.

Instead, confusion crossed her features.

"This is not my journal," she said.

The words hit Cornelius like a physical blow.

"What?" His voice came out strangled. "That is impossible. The description matches. The pressed flower design. The dark leather. The—"

"This is not my journal," Dr. Floros repeated. She turned the book so everyone could see the first page. "This is... botanical field notes, yes. But not mine. The handwriting is different. The format is different. This is printed text, not handwritten entries."

Cornelius's world tilted.

No.

No, this was wrong.

He had found it. The journal. The proof. The evidence that would solve everything.

"Let me see that." Theo took the book from Dr. Floros and examined it closely. His expression hardened as he read the title page.

"*Secret Wonders: Field notes on medicinal herbs of the coastal regions,*" Theo read aloud. "Property of the Solterra Bay Public Library."

Silence.

Absolute, crushing silence.

Cornelius's mind went blank. White. Empty.

This was not possible.

He had found a dark leather journal with a pressed flower design in Brother Demos's carrel. Hidden beneath research papers. Everything had fit. Everything had—

"This is your missing library book," Theo said, his voice dangerously quiet. "Not the stolen journal."

"I..." Cornelius could not form words.

Brother Demos stood slowly, his hands still shaking but his voice growing stronger. "I can explain that."

"Please do," Theo said.

The monk swallowed hard. "I—I borrowed it. Against regulations. I know I should have checked it out formally, but the library has a six-week loan limit, and I needed it longer. My research required extended access to specific coastal herb references, and I thought... I thought if I just kept it in my carrel, used it only there, it would not be missed."

"Theft," Cornelius managed. "You stole it."

"I borrowed it improperly," Demos corrected. "I always intended to return it. I was not hiding it from you, Head Librarian. I simply... I needed it. The information was critical for my work on tidal medicinal compounds, and I could not keep renewing the loan without drawing attention."

Theo's gaze fixed on Cornelius. "And this is the evidence you used to accuse Brother Demos of stealing Dr. Floros's journal? A library book that was technically borrowed against policy?"

"It was hidden," Cornelius said desperately. "Beneath papers. Concealed."

"It was on my desk," Demos countered. "Under research notes because I was actively using both simultaneously. I was cross-referencing the coastal herb entries with my own field observations." He turned to Dr. Floros. "I swear to you, Doctor, I have never seen your journal. I have never been to the Sea View Guest House. I do not know Kyriakos Vlahos. I have never worn expensive perfume in my life."

"The witness saw you at the tide pools," Cornelius insisted. "Three days ago. Before dawn. Measuring the—"

"I have not been to Widow's Perch in over a year," Demos said firmly. "I have witnesses. The temple keeps records of our movements. Brother Andreas can confirm I was at morning meditation three days ago. Every day. I follow a strict schedule."

Theo stood. "I will verify that. Immediately." He turned to Cornelius, his expression ice-cold. "You wasted my time. Again."

"The perfume," Cornelius tried. "The brown satchel. The—"

"Circumstantial," Theo interrupted. "You accused a man based on coincidental physical descriptions and a misidentified book. You have no actual evidence. No proof. Nothing."

"Captain, I assure you, I conducted a thorough investigation—"

"You conducted harassment." Theo's voice cut like a blade. "I explicitly ordered you to pursue proper evidence. To work through official channels. And instead, you staged this..." He gestured at the assembled room. "This theatrical accusation. Based on a library book that was technically borrowed against policy."

Cornelius's claws scraped the floor. "Brother Demos violated library regulations—"

"Which is your jurisdiction," Theo said. "Not a criminal matter. Not Watch business. Certainly not grounds for accusing someone of theft in front of witnesses."

Dr. Floros stood, clutching her shawl. "Then my journal is still missing. And the Orchid blooms tomorrow night. And we have no leads. No suspects. Nothing."

"I am sorry, Doctor," Theo said, his tone genuinely regretful. "But this investigation has been compromised from the beginning. The Head Librarian's... enthusiasm... has tainted any legitimate lines of inquiry. Without concrete evidence or credible leads, there is nothing the Watch can do."

"You are abandoning the case?" Cornelius demanded.

"There is no case," Theo said flatly. "No verified crime scene evidence. No credible suspects. Just accusations and theories from a librarian who has repeatedly demonstrated poor judgment." He picked up *Secret Wonders* and handed it back to Cornelius. "File whatever internal library complaint you want against Brother Demos for improper borrowing. But do not waste Watch resources again."

He turned and walked out.

The sound of his footsteps echoed through the reading room like hammer blows.

Brother Demos stood slowly. "I apologize for the improper loan, Head Librarian. I will accept whatever disciplinary measures you deem appropriate. But I did not steal Dr. Floros's journal. I hope you find the real thief."

He left.

The reading room felt cavernous now. Empty.

Dr. Floros looked at Cornelius with something worse than anger.

Disappointment.

"I thought..." She shook her head. "Imelda said you were the best. That you would help. But this..." She gathered her shawl tighter. "The Orchid blooms in twenty-four hours. And you have nothing. No journal. No leads. Nothing."

She walked out.

Imelda remained seated, her ageless eyes fixed on Cornelius with an expression he could not read.

"You made a mistake," she said quietly.

"I was certain," Cornelius whispered. "The evidence fit. The pattern was clear. I—"

"You were wrong." Imelda stood. "And worse, you accused someone publicly without verifying your facts. Brother Demos is guilty only of academic desperation and poor library etiquette. You humiliated him. Wasted Captain Theo's time. And destroyed Dr. Floros's remaining hope."

Each word landed like a stone.

"I will speak with Anthea," Imelda continued. "Try to salvage what I can. You..." She paused. "You should consider whether your pride has compromised your ability to help anyone."

She left.

Cornelius stood alone at the head of the table.

The perfect reading room.

The perfect arrangement.

All of it meaningless.

Zeph approached cautiously from the reference desk. "Boss? Are you—"

"Leave," Cornelius said. His voice came out hollow. "Just... leave."

Zeph hesitated, then nodded and retreated toward the entrance hall.

Cornelius looked down at *Secret Wonders* in his claws.

The book he had labeled "MISPLACED" weeks ago because he could not bear the humiliation of admitting theft.

The book he had changed to "STOLEN" last night in a fit of triumphant certainty.

The book that was neither stolen nor misplaced, just borrowed improperly by a desperate student who could not afford to keep renewing loans.

He had been so certain.

So absolutely, completely certain.

The journal had been there. In the carrel. Dark leather. Pressed flower design. Hidden beneath papers.

Everything had fit.

Except it had not been the journal at all.

Just a library book that looked similar.

A pattern that was not actually a pattern.

Evidence that was not actually evidence.

Cornelius's legs gave out. He sat heavily in the nearest chair, his tail curling around his body.

Dr. Floros's journal was still missing.

The real thief was still free.

The Orchid would bloom tomorrow night, and Kyriakos—or whoever the False Gardener truly was—would harvest it.

And Cornelius had nothing.

No leads. No suspects. No credibility.

Captain Theo had shut down the investigation.

Imelda was disappointed in him.

Dr. Floros had lost hope.

He had failed.

Completely, publicly, humiliatingly failed.

The library was silent around him.

His hoard. His responsibility. His sanctuary.

And he could not even protect one stolen journal.

Cornelius stared at *Secret Wonders* in his claws and felt something crack inside his chest.

Not his pride.

Deeper than that.

His certainty.

His belief that order could be maintained. That patterns revealed truth. That careful investigation always yielded answers.

All of it was gone.

The Hunt was over.

And he had caught nothing.

# Chapter 11

Seventeen.

Cornelius dropped the paperclip into the left-hand compartment of his desk organizer and selected another from the unsorted pile.

Eighteen.

This one had a slight bend in the upper curve. Manufacturing defect. He set it aside in the designated rejection pile and chose the next.

Nineteen.

The library was silent.

Not the comfortable silence of after-hours solitude. This was the thick, oppressive silence of a tomb. Or a failure.

Twenty.

The paperclip gleamed in his claws—brass-plated steel, standard library issue, precisely 1.25 inches in length when measured along the outer wire. He had measured them all three years ago when the new shipment arrived. Recorded the specifications in his supply ledger.

Order. System. Control.

The things he was supposed to be good at.

Twenty-one.

Through his office doorway, the main stacks stretched in perfect rows. Every book properly shelved. Every spine aligned. The catalog system he had maintained for forty-three years without error.

Except he had made errors.

So many errors.

Twenty-two.

Cornelius's claws trembled slightly as he placed the paperclip in its compartment. He forced his talons steady and selected another.

Twenty-three.

The ventilation grate in his wall mocked him. He had removed it two nights ago. Crawled through those ducts like some common sneak-thief. Violated library policy. Broken into Brother Demos's carrel.

And for what?

Twenty-four.

A book that was not the stolen journal. A pattern that was not actually a pattern. A certainty that had been nothing but arrogance.

Twenty-five.

The door to the library's entrance hall creaked.

Cornelius did not look up. Likely Zeph, returning from whatever errand he had invented to escape the oppressive atmosphere. The boy had been finding excuses to leave all morning. Organizing the return cart. Checking the front steps for debris. Purchasing fresh ink from the market stalls.

Anything to avoid sitting in this silent tomb with his failed mentor.

Twenty-six.

Footsteps approached. Slow. Hesitant.

Not Zeph's usual energetic stride.

Cornelius's heat-sense detected a familiar thermal signature. Cooler than human baseline. Dryad-touched physiology.

Dr. Anthea Floros.

His claws froze mid-reach for paperclip twenty-seven.

"Head Librarian?" Her voice was soft. Fragile.

Cornelius forced himself to look up.

Dr. Floros stood in his office doorway, clutching her shawl around her shoulders despite the warmth of the afternoon. Her silver hair had escaped its usual neat bun, hanging in loose strands around her face. She looked older than she had four days ago when she had first burst through the library doors seeking help.

Much older.

"Doctor." Cornelius's voice came out rough. He cleared his throat. "I did not expect—that is, I thought you had returned to—"

"I am leaving tonight," she said. "The evening ferry. Imelda helped me arrange passage." She stepped into the office, her gaze moving across the organized desk, the sorted paperclips, the meticulously arranged reference volumes on the shelf behind him. "I wanted to thank you. Before I left. For trying."

The words landed like stones in Cornelius's chest.

"I did not try," he said flatly. "I failed. Completely. Publicly."

"You tried," she repeated. She moved closer, her fingers worrying at the edge of her shawl. "You spent days investigating. You climbed cliffs. You questioned witnesses. You—"

"I accused an innocent monk. Twice." Cornelius's tail lashed once against the desk leg. "I wasted Captain Theo's time with theatrical nonsense. I gave you false hope and—" His voice cracked. He stopped.

Dr. Floros was quiet for a moment. Then: "It was not your fault."

"It was entirely my fault. I saw patterns instead of evidence. I—"

"No." She shook her head, and Cornelius noticed her hands were trembling. "I mean the journal. Its loss. That was not your fault." She took a shaky breath. "It was mine."

Cornelius straightened. "Doctor, you were the victim of a theft. You cannot—"

"I have been forgetting things," she said quietly. "For months now. Small things at first. Where I left my notes. What day I had scheduled a meeting. But recently..." She sank into the chair across from his desk, the one reserved for patron consultations. "Sometimes I cannot remember conversations I had the previous day. Or I misplace objects I was certain I had put away properly."

"Dr. Floros—"

"The journal." Her voice broke. "I told you it was stolen from my room. That I had left it on my writing desk. But what if I did not? What if I put it somewhere else and simply... forgot? What if I left it at the market, or the temple archives, or—" She pressed her hands to her face. "What if there was no theft at all? What if I am just losing my mind, and you wasted days searching for something I simply misplaced through my own failing memory?"

The weight of her words settled over the office like dust.

Cornelius knew he should say something. Offer reassurance. Argue against her self-blame.

But he had no proof.

No evidence that she had not simply misplaced her own journal through absent-mindedness.

No certainty that his entire investigation had not been built on the confused recollections of a woman whose memory was failing.

Just like he'd had no proof that Brother Demos was the thief.

No evidence that the brown leather book was the stolen journal.

No certainty about anything except that he had been wrong.

"I am sorry," Dr. Floros whispered. "For wasting your time. For causing such trouble with Captain Theo and the temple. For—"

"You did not waste my time," Cornelius said. The words felt hollow. "I chose to investigate. I chose to make assumptions. I chose to—" He stopped. Started again. "Your memory may be struggling, Doctor. But theft is still the most logical explanation. Your room was locked. The window was forced open. Someone—"

"Or I opened the window myself and forgot," she said dully. "Or I never locked the door properly. Or I—" She stood abruptly. "It does not matter. The journal is gone. The Orchid blooms tonight. I will not be there to document it. Fifty years of preparation, and I missed my only chance because I cannot keep track of a single book."

She moved toward the door.

"Doctor—"

"Thank you for trying, Head Librarian." She paused in the doorway, her back to him. "Imelda was right. You are a good investigator. A good dragon. This failure was not yours. It was mine."

She left.

Her footsteps echoed through the stacks. The entrance door creaked open. Closed.

Silence returned.

Heavier than before.

Cornelius stared at the pile of unsorted paperclips.

Twenty-seven remaining.

He reached for the next one.

His claws would not close properly. They trembled. Shook.

He could not pick up a paperclip.

Could not perform the simplest task.

Could not even count to fifty without his certainty crumbling.

Cornelius set his claws flat on the desk surface and focused on breathing.

In. Out. In. Out.

Dr. Floros blamed herself.

Captain Theo had dismissed him as an incompetent amateur.

Imelda thought his pride had compromised his judgment.

Brother Demos had been publicly humiliated.

And somewhere in Solterra Bay, the real thief—if there even was a real thief—walked free.

The Moon-Scented Orchid would bloom tonight under the full moon. No one would document it. No one would protect it.

Fifty years until the next bloom.

Cornelius had failed everyone.

The library door crashed open.

Not a creak. Not a polite knock.

A bang.

Footsteps thundered through the entrance hall—running, frantic.

"Boss? Boss! Are you here? Please tell me you are here because I am dying. Actually dying. This is it. This is how I die."

Zeph burst into the office, wild-eyed and breathing hard. His hair stood up in at least seven different directions. His shirt was on backward. His feet were bare.

He was not dying.

He was panicking.

Cornelius's investigative instincts engaged automatically despite himself. "Where are your shoes?"

"I do not know!" Zeph's voice cracked. "I lost them! Or maybe I never had them? I cannot remember. Boss, you have to help me. You have to—" He stopped, staring at Cornelius's desk. "Are you counting paperclips?"

"I was organizing supplies."

"You are counting paperclips," Zeph repeated. "That is... okay. No. Not okay. Nothing is okay. Boss, Sophia sent a message. A formal invitation. To the Lantern Lighting tonight at Harbor Square. And I—I said yes. Because what else was I supposed to say? But now it is in four hours and I do not know what to wear or what to say or how to act around her when it is not in an alley behind a guest house where we are investigating a theft, and—"

"Breathe," Cornelius said.

Zeph sucked in air. "I am breathing. I am breathing so much. Too much. Is it possible to breathe too much?"

"Yes. You are hyperventilating. Sit down."

"I cannot sit down. If I sit down I will never stand up again and then I will miss the Lantern Lighting and Sophia will think I am unreliable—again—and that will be it. She will decide I am not worth her time and I will die alone surrounded by books and dust and—"

"You will not die alone surrounded by books," Cornelius said. "That is my retirement plan. You will need to find your own."

Zeph stared at him. Then, impossibly, laughed. A single, slightly hysterical bark of laughter. "That is not funny."

"It was mildly humorous."

"It was dark."

"I am a dragon. We have dark humor."

Zeph sank into the chair Dr. Floros had vacated moments before. "I cannot do this. I cannot go to the Lantern Lighting. I will mess it up. I always mess things up. Last time I saw her I was covered in fish smell and looking guilty about sneaking around a crime scene. Before that I missed our meeting because you locked me in the library. Before that—"

"Before that, she invited you to sketch Festival lanterns with her," Cornelius interrupted. "And you had a perfectly pleasant conversation about the intersection of art and science. I was there. I observed the entire interaction from a rooftop."

Zeph's eyes widened. "You what?"

"Irrelevant." Cornelius waved one claw dismissively. "The point is that Sophia Doukas has demonstrated continued interest in your company despite your previous scheduling conflicts and olfactory challenges. She would not have sent a formal invitation if she intended to reject you."

"But what if—"

"What if you worry yourself into actual illness and miss the event entirely?" Cornelius fixed him with a stern look. "That would be self-fulfilling prophecy. Irrational. Inefficient."

Zeph slumped in the chair. "I need help."

"You need shoes."

"I need more than shoes, Boss." Zeph's voice dropped. "I need... I do not know. Coaching? Support? Someone to make sure I do not say something stupid or trip over my own feet or accidentally insult her family's tile-glazing secrets?"

Cornelius's tail curled slowly around the base of his desk chair.

He knew what Zeph was asking.

What he was really asking.

"You want me to accompany you," Cornelius said.

"Yes! Exactly. You could be my wingman. Make sure I do not mess this up. You are good at noticing things. You could tell me if I am about to do something embarrassing, or if she looks bored, or—"

"I am not good at noticing things," Cornelius said quietly. "I have spent the past four days proving exactly how bad I am at noticing things."

Zeph leaned forward. "That is not true."

"I accused an innocent monk. Twice."

"You were trying to solve a theft."

"I saw patterns that did not exist."

"You were trying to help Dr. Floros."

"I failed," Cornelius said. The word came out harsh. Final. "Completely. Publicly. I have no credibility left. No authority. No—" He stopped. His claws had curled into fists against the desktop. "I am not the dragon you think I am, Zeph. I am not some brilliant investigator. I am just a librarian who cannot even protect a single stolen journal."

Silence.

Zeph was quiet for a long moment. Then: "Do you know what I think?"

"I do not require—"

"I think you are having a really bad day," Zeph continued. "Actually, a really bad four days. And you messed up. You did. I am not going to lie about that. But you know what? You also climbed a cliff in a storm to interview a hermit because you thought it would help. You crawled through ventilation ducts—which, by the way, I know about because I saw the dust on your scales yesterday morning and I am not an idiot—because you were trying to find evidence. You spent days tracking down leads and questioning witnesses and organizing a whole investigation because someone you barely knew asked for help."

"I failed her."

"You tried for her," Zeph said. "That is more than Captain Theo did. More than anyone else did." He stood. "And right now, I am asking you to try for me. Not to solve a mystery or catch a thief or prove anything to anyone. Just... come to the Lantern Lighting. Stand near me. Make sure I do not completely humiliate myself in front of the girl I like."

Cornelius looked at his assistant.

Really looked.

Zeph's shirt was on backward. His hair was chaos. His feet were bare and probably bruised from running across the cobblestones without shoes.

He had come here despite all of that.

Had asked for help despite knowing Cornelius was wallowing in defeat.

Had offered reassurance—clumsy, teenage reassurance, but genuine—despite having every right to be frustrated with his mentor's recent behavior.

Cornelius's investigation had cost Zeph his first date. Had trapped him in the library during a magical lockdown. Had repeatedly pulled him away from his personal life to chase leads that went nowhere.

And still, here he stood, asking for help.

Trusting that Cornelius might have something useful to offer.

"I am not good at social events," Cornelius said finally.

"I know."

"I do not understand human courtship rituals."

"I know."

"I will likely say something inappropriate about optimal conversation spacing or the statistical probability of relationship success."

"Probably," Zeph agreed. His mouth quirked into a half-smile. "But you will be there. That is what matters."

Cornelius's claws uncurled slowly from their fists.

He looked at the pile of unsorted paperclips. Twenty-seven remaining. A task he could complete in minutes. A simple, ordered, controllable task.

Or he could stand up. Leave the library. Walk into Harbor Square where crowds gathered and music played and lanterns swung from poles in preparation for the Twinkle Nights celebration.

Where he might encounter Captain Theo or Imelda or Dr. Floros or any number of people who had witnessed his spectacular failure this morning.

Where he would have to exist in public as a dragon who had been wrong.

Or.

Or he could go because his assistant needed him.

Not as a brilliant investigator. Not as Head Librarian. Not as anything except someone who would stand nearby and make sure Zeph did not trip over his own feet.

That was a duty he could fulfill.

That was something he could do without requiring certainty or evidence or patterns.

Just... presence.

Cornelius stood. His joints protested slightly—he had been sitting too long, hunched over his desk in his misery.

"Four hours until the Lantern Lighting?" he asked.

Zeph's face lit up. "Yes. Well, three hours and forty-seven minutes now. But yes."

"Then you have time to return home, locate your shoes, change your shirt so it faces the correct direction, and possibly do something about your hair situation."

"My hair is fine—" Zeph caught Cornelius's expression. "My hair is terrible. Got it. I will fix it." He started backing toward the door, grinning. "You are really coming? You are really going to be my wingman?"

"I am really going to ensure you do not embarrass yourself beyond recovery," Cornelius corrected. "That is not the same thing."

"Close enough." Zeph paused in the doorway. "Thank you, Boss."

"Do not thank me yet. You have not seen my social performance at Festival events. It is... not optimal."

"Better than mine, I bet."

"That is a low threshold."

Zeph laughed and disappeared into the stacks. His footsteps echoed through the library—running again, but lighter this time. Less frantic.

The entrance door banged open. Closed.

Silence returned.

But different now.

Less oppressive.

Still heavy, yes. Still weighted with failure and guilt and the knowledge that Dr. Floros was leaving tonight without her journal, without her documentation, without her fifty-year dream fulfilled.

But also with... something else.

Purpose.

Small. Immediate. Manageable.

Not solving a theft or catching a criminal or restoring his reputation.

Just standing in Harbor Square next to a nervous teenage boy who needed someone to tell him when his hair looked ridiculous.

Cornelius looked down at his desk.

Twenty-seven unsorted paperclips remained.

He could finish the task. Complete the organization. Restore order to this one small corner of his world.

Or he could leave them for later.

Trust that they would still be here when he returned.

Accept that some things could wait.

His claws hovered over the pile for a moment.

Then he turned away.

The paperclips would keep.

Zeph would not.

Cornelius moved through the stacks toward his private quarters. He needed to make himself presentable. Clean the dust from his scales properly. Ensure his spectacles were polished.

Not because he cared about the Festival.

Not because he wanted to be seen in public.

But because if he was going to serve as Zeph's wingman—whatever that meant—he should at least look like a dragon who had his circumstances under control.

Even if that was a complete fabrication.

Even if his certainty was shattered and his reputation was ruined and his investigation had failed.

He could still do this one thing.

Show up. Stand nearby. Be present.

It was not solving a mystery.

But perhaps it was enough.

For now.

For tonight.

Until he figured out what came next.

If anything came next.

Cornelius stepped into his quarters and caught sight of his reflection in the small mirror above his wash basin.

A dragon stared back.

Scales dull from stress. Eyes tired. Wings held too tight against his sides.

He looked defeated.

He was defeated.

But Zeph had still asked for his help.

That had to mean something.

Cornelius began the process of cleaning his scales, working methodically from snout to tail-tip. Restoring order to his physical appearance even if his mental state remained chaos.

Three hours and forty-seven minutes until the Lantern Lighting.

Plenty of time to make himself presentable.

To prepare for an evening of social anxiety and probably saying inappropriate things about Festival traditions.

To be a wingman.

Whatever that meant.

He would figure it out.

Somehow.

# Chapter 12

# Chapter 12

The Festival was loud.

Aggressively, persistently, unnecessarily loud.

Cornelius perched on the stone shoulder of Saint Kyria's statue in Harbor Square and resisted the urge to retreat to his library immediately. The marble saint stood twelve feet tall, her arms outstretched in eternal blessing over the crowds below. Her left shoulder provided an excellent vantage point and kept him safely above the chaos.

This was a terrible idea.

Below, the Festival grounds teemed with bodies—human, satyr, orc, elf, all pressed together in violation of reasonable personal space protocols. Music tangled from three different sources: a string quartet near the VIP pavilion, drums by the fountain, and something involving bells and possibly enthusiastic cats near the food stalls.

The Twinkle Nights beetles had arrived in force. Thousands of them filled the air, their bioluminescent abdomens pulsing with soft blue-green light. The "Lights Out" policy was in full effect—no lanterns, no torches, no enchanted streetlamps. Just the beetles and the specific ceremonial lanterns waiting to be lit at the stroke of ten bells.

The effect was admittedly striking. The insects moved in waves, creating patterns of light and shadow that shifted across the crowd like water. Their glow reflected off the polished tiles of the square, turning the ground into a constellation map.

Beautiful.

Also disorienting.

Also very far from the ordered silence of his library.

Cornelius's claws gripped the statue's shoulder. His tail wrapped twice around Saint Kyria's stone neck for stability. He had polished his scales. Cleaned his spectacles. Made himself presentable for exactly this: standing guard while his assistant courted a tile artist.

Being a "wingman."

Whatever that meant.

His heat-sense tracked Zeph thirty feet below, standing near the fountain with Sophia Doukas. The boy had managed to locate shoes. His shirt faced the correct direction. His hair remained chaotic, but Sophia did not seem to mind.

In fact, she was laughing.

Actually laughing—not the polite social laughter Cornelius had observed during their first meeting. This was genuine. Her thermal signature registered the elevated heart rate and increased circulation consistent with happiness.

Zeph said something Cornelius could not hear over the music and crowd noise. Sophia's hand touched his arm. Her fingers lingered there.

Good.

That was good.

Cornelius's job was to ensure Zeph did not catastrophically embarrass himself. So far, the boy was exceeding expectations.

Which meant Cornelius could focus on being miserable in public.

A burst of music from the string quartet made him wince. The notes tangled with the drums, creating auditory chaos that set his scales itching. How did humans tolerate this? The noise. The crowds. The complete absence of organization.

The Festival grounds sprawled across Harbor Square in a pattern that defied logic. Food stalls clustered near the fountain, forcing foot traffic to bottleneck. The VIP pavilion occupied the prime viewing area for the lantern lighting, blocking visibility for anyone of reasonable height who could not afford expensive seating. Beetle-watchers gathered in random clumps rather than orderly rows.

No system.

No structure.

Just chaos illuminated by insects.

Cornelius checked the position of the moon through the gaps in the beetle swarm. Quarter past nine bells. Forty-five minutes until the ceremonial lighting.

He could endure forty-five minutes.

He had endured worse.

This morning's humiliation, for instance.

The memory surfaced unbidden: the reading room. Captain Theo's cold dismissal. Dr. Floros's devastated expression when the "recovered journal" turned out to be a library book. Imelda's quiet disappointment.

His certainty crumbling like cheap parchment.

Cornelius's claws tightened on the stone.

No.

He was not thinking about that now.

He was here for Zeph. That was the mission. Watch his assistant navigate social complexity. Ensure minimal disaster. Perhaps offer tactical advice if—

Below, Sophia laughed again. She had moved closer to Zeph. Their shoulders touched.

Tactical advice appeared unnecessary.

The beetles swirled overhead in a particularly dense formation, casting the square into brief shadow before dispersing. The crowd made appreciative sounds. Someone near the food stalls dropped a plate. The resulting crash made Cornelius's scales prickle.

He forced his attention across the square, scanning for potential threats.

Not investigative threats.

Social threats.

The kind that might interrupt Zeph's progress.

The VIP pavilion glowed with enchanted beetle-lanterns—apparently wealthy patrons were exempt from the "Lights Out" policy. Silk banners hung from the pavilion's posts, displaying the crests of Solterra Bay's merchant families. Tables laden with wine and delicacies crowded the space.

Cornelius's heat-sense identified the thermal signatures inside: expensive clothing, elevated temperatures from wine consumption, the distinctive cool signature of elf physiology.

Imelda was there. He recognized her thermal pattern.

She had not acknowledged him when he arrived at the Festival. Had not even looked in his direction.

Still disappointed, then.

Fair.

He had earned her disappointment.

Cornelius pulled his attention away from the pavilion and scanned the rest of the square. Harbor Master's staff clustered near the fountain's north edge, their uniforms making them easy to identify. A group of temple monks stood by the beetle-watching platform, their gray robes dark against the insect glow.

Brother Demos was among them.

Cornelius's tail twitched.

The monk appeared recovered from this morning's public accusation. He was speaking with Sister Photine, gesturing toward the beetle swarm with academic enthusiasm.

Good.

That was... good.

Brother Demos deserved to enjoy the Festival without his false accuser lurking nearby.

Cornelius shifted his weight on Saint Kyria's shoulder and checked on Zeph again.

The boy had produced something from his pocket. A small object wrapped in cloth. He handed it to Sophia with visible nervousness.

She unwrapped it carefully.

Her thermal signature spiked—surprise, then pleasure.

Whatever the gift was, she approved.

Excellent.

Zeph was handling this without assistance.

Which meant Cornelius's presence was largely decorative.

He was a gargoyle.

A very uncomfortable gargoyle with an excellent view of other people enjoying themselves.

The music shifted. The string quartet began something slower. Couples near the fountain moved closer together, swaying to the rhythm.

Sophia took Zeph's hand.

Oh.

They were dancing.

Sort of.

Zeph's movement could not technically be classified as dancing. It was more... rhythmic shuffling. But Sophia did not seem to mind. She was smiling. Guiding him through the motions.

Her hand rested on his shoulder. His hand hovered uncertainly at her waist.

They would be fine.

Cornelius could leave.

Should leave, probably.

Retreat to the library. Return to his paperclip counting. Stop pretending he had anything useful to contribute to—

Movement in the VIP pavilion caught his attention.

Not movement, exactly.

Absence of movement.

Cornelius's heat-sense swept the pavilion again, cataloging the signatures present. Imelda. Harbor Master Philippos. Several merchant family heads. Two visiting scholars he vaguely recognized.

Someone was missing.

He focused, filtering through the thermal patterns more carefully.

Kyriakos Vlahos was not in the VIP pavilion.

Cornelius's scales prickled.

That was wrong.

Kyriakos was a celebrity perfumer. A wealthy visitor during Solterra Bay's premier Festival event. He should be in the VIP section, networking with potential clients, showcasing his presence.

But he was not there.

Cornelius scanned the crowd below, searching for the distinctive thermal signature he had memorized during their interview. Satyr-kin ran slightly warmer than baseline human. Kyriakos also wore expensive clothing that would show clear heat retention patterns.

Nothing near the fountain.

Nothing by the food stalls.

Nothing in the general Festival crowd.

Cornelius's frustration built. The beetles obscured visibility. The crowd was too dense. He needed—

There.

At the far edge of Harbor Square, where the cobblestones gave way to the coastal path.

A thermal signature moving away from the Festival. Heading northwest.

Toward the cliffs.

Cornelius focused his heat-sense, narrowing his attention to that single figure.

Satyr-kin physiology. Male. Moving with purpose rather than casual strolling.

The clothing registered wrong, though. Not expensive fabric. Not the silk and velvet Kyriakos had worn during their previous encounters.

Rough cloth. Work clothing.

And a satchel.

Brown leather, based on how the heat distributed across the bag's surface.

Cornelius's breath caught.

The figure paused at the edge of the square, glancing back toward the Festival crowds. The beetle-light caught his face for just a moment.

Kyriakos Vlahos.

Wearing rough clothing. Carrying a satchel. Heading away from the Festival toward Widow's Perch.

Toward the tide pools.

Toward the Moon-Scented Orchid.

The pieces assembled in Cornelius's mind with terrible clarity.

Orestes had warned him. "The False Gardener will come when the Orchid blooms."

Tonight was the bloom.

Full moon. Low tide.

And Kyriakos was moving toward the cliffs dressed for fieldwork, not Festival attendance.

Not attending the social event where his presence would be expected.

Because he had other plans.

Cornelius's earlier investigation crashed through his memory. The perfume in Dr. Floros's room. The borosilicate glass fragments. Kyriakos's history of stealing proprietary knowledge—Sophia's family glaze formula, and now botanical research.

He had dismissed Kyriakos.

Marked him off the suspect list because the perfumer had an alibi and the scent was "too common" to be probative.

But what if Kyriakos had not stolen the journal himself?

What if he had hired someone?

What if Brother Demos was not the thief, but someone else—someone wearing monk's robes as disguise—had taken the journal and delivered it to Kyriakos?

What if Cornelius had been investigating the wrong direction entirely?

The False Gardener.

Not a scholar seeking knowledge.

A collector seeking possession.

Someone who would bottle the Moon-Scented Orchid. Harvest it. Own it.

Exactly what Orestes had warned against.

Cornelius's claws scraped against stone.

Kyriakos was heading for the Orchid right now.

Dr. Floros was gone—departed on the evening ferry, believing her life's work was lost.

Orestes would try to stop Kyriakos, but the hermit was one aging dryad-touched human against a wealthy collector who had demonstrated willingness to steal and exploit.

Someone needed to intervene.

Someone needed to—

Below, near the fountain, Sophia rose on her toes and kissed Zeph.

Brief. Soft. The kind of first kiss that made Zeph's thermal signature spike with shock and delight.

When they separated, both were smiling.

Zeph looked happy.

Actually, genuinely happy in a way Cornelius had rarely seen.

And Cornelius was about to abandon him at the Festival to chase a suspect based on another pattern.

Another theory.

Another certainty that might be completely wrong.

He had promised to be Zeph's wingman.

Had agreed to stand nearby. Be present. Ensure minimal disaster.

But Kyriakos was getting away.

The Orchid was in danger.

And Cornelius was the only one who knew.

He checked Zeph's position again. The boy was holding Sophia's hand. They were talking. Laughing. Moving toward the lantern-lighting platform where the ceremony would begin soon.

Zeph was fine.

Better than fine.

He did not need Cornelius anymore.

Not for this.

But the Orchid—

The Moon-Scented Orchid that bloomed once every fifty years.

Dr. Floros's life work.

The living truth Orestes protected.

That needed someone.

Cornelius's wings shifted against his sides. His tail unwound from Saint Kyria's neck.

This was a terrible idea.

He had been wrong before. Wrong about Brother Demos. Wrong about the journal's location. Wrong about everything.

What if he was wrong now?

What if Kyriakos was simply taking a walk? Heading home via the coastal path? Dressed in work clothing for completely innocent reasons?

What if Cornelius was seeing patterns again instead of evidence?

But.

But what if he was right?

What if, for once, his pattern-recognition was actually correct?

What if the False Gardener truly was moving toward the Orchid right now, and Cornelius did nothing?

Below, the crowd began gathering for the lantern lighting. The string quartet played the ceremonial prelude. Festival-goers pressed toward the platform, eager for the main event.

Zeph and Sophia stood together in the crowd, their hands still linked.

They would be fine without him.

The Orchid might not be.

Cornelius made his decision.

He launched from Saint Kyria's shoulder, wings spreading to catch the air. The beetles scattered around him, briefly disrupting their patterns. His heat-sense locked onto Kyriakos's retreating thermal signature.

The perfumer had reached the coastal path. Moving quickly now. Heading northwest toward Widow's Perch with clear purpose.

Cornelius glided above the Festival crowds, silent and fast. The beetle-light cast strange shadows across the cobblestones below. Music faded behind him as he left Harbor Square.

His wings beat steadily, carrying him over the lower district's rooftops toward the cliffs.

Hunt mode engaged.

Predatory focus narrowed to a single target.

The False Gardener would not reach the Orchid unchallenged.

Not while Cornelius could still fly.

Not while he could still try.

Even if he was wrong.

Even if this was another mistake.

He had to know.

The coastal path stretched ahead, dark except for occasional beetle swarms. Kyriakos moved along it like he knew exactly where he was going.

Because he did.

Because he had Dr. Floros's stolen journal.

Because he had the map.

Cornelius's certainty crystallized as he flew.

This was right.

This was the pattern that actually fit.

And this time—this time—he would not fail.

The Hunt had begun again.

For real this time.

And he would see it through.

Whatever came next.

# Chapter 13

# Chapter 13

The wind hit Cornelius like a physical blow.

He folded his wings tight against his sides and dropped the last ten feet to the cliff trail, claws scrabbling for purchase on the limestone. The same murderous wind that had nearly peeled his scales off during his first visit to Widow's Perch roared past, carrying ocean spray and the bitter taste of salt.

His heat-sense swept the trail ahead.

Nothing.

No thermal signature where Kyriakos should be.

Cornelius crept forward, belly low to the stone. The beetles provided minimal light—just enough to outline the path's edge where it dropped away into darkness and crashing waves below. His spectacles misted immediately in the spray. He pushed them higher on his snout with one claw and kept moving.

The trail curved along the cliff face. Narrow. Treacherous.

Exactly as he remembered.

Except last time, Orestes had appeared from nowhere to guide him to the tide pools.

This time, the path was empty.

Cornelius's wings pressed tighter against his sides. His tail swept back and forth, maintaining balance as gusts tried to shove him toward the cliff edge.

Where was Kyriakos?

His heat-sense detected nothing warm-blooded ahead. Just cold stone and colder ocean wind.

Had he been wrong again?

Had he followed another false pattern and abandoned Zeph at the Festival for—

Movement.

Not heat.

Shape.

Something dark against the darker cliff wall, thirty feet ahead where the trail widened into the alcove overlooking the tide pools.

Cornelius froze.

His heat-sense focused on the shape.

Cold.

Too cold.

Stone-temperature.

But the wrong shape for stone.

Cornelius crept closer, claws silent on the limestone. The wind howled. Ocean spray misted across his scales.

Twenty feet.

Fifteen.

The shape resolved into form.

A body.

Slumped against the cliff wall with limbs at wrong angles.

Cornelius's breath caught.

Too small for Kyriakos. Wrong build entirely.

Human. Male. Old.

Wearing rough-woven cloth that blended with the stone.

Orestes.

Cornelius launched forward, abandoning stealth for speed. His claws hit the alcove's flat surface and he scrambled to the hermit's side.

Not moving.

Stone-cold to heat-sense.

No—

Wait.

Cornelius pressed one claw to Orestes's chest.

Heartbeat.

Faint. Slow. But present.

Air moved through the hermit's lungs. Shallow breaths with long pauses between.

Alive.

Barely.

Cornelius's predatory focus narrowed. His claws moved across Orestes's body, checking for injuries with the methodical precision he used for book condition assessments.

No blood. No broken bones. No obvious wounds.

But Orestes's wrists were bound behind his back with rough rope. His ankles tied together. A strip of cloth gagged his mouth.

Cornelius's talons made quick work of the bonds. The rope fell away. The gag pulled free.

Orestes's head lolled forward.

Still unconscious.

Why?

Cornelius leaned closer, examining the hermit's face in the dim beetle-light.

Orestes's lips were slightly blue. His breathing remained dangerously shallow. His thermal signature registered several degrees below normal human baseline.

Hypothermia?

No. The night was cool but not that cold. And Orestes was dryad-touched—his physiology should regulate better than baseline human.

Cornelius's heat-sense swept the immediate area.

There.

On the stone beside Orestes's hip.

A scrap of cloth. Slightly warmer than the surrounding limestone, indicating recent contact with something heat-retaining.

Cornelius picked it up carefully.

Thick fabric. Rough weave.

He held it closer to his snout.

The cloth carried residue. Chemical residue that made his nostrils burn slightly even without actively smelling it.

His mind cataloged the sensation automatically.

Similar to the alchemical preservatives used in certain bookbinding processes. Sweet undertone. Slightly caustic.

Chloroform.

Cornelius's scales prickled.

Someone had drugged Orestes.

Overpowered the hermit who could literally merge with stone and become part of the cliff face.

His claws moved across the alcove's surface, searching for additional evidence.

There.

Near the edge where the alcove overlooked the tide pools below.

A glint of reflected beetle-light.

Cornelius crept to the spot and examined it closely.

Glass.

A single shard no larger than his smallest claw.

He recognized the type immediately. Borosilicate. The same specialized laboratory glass he had found in Dr. Floros's room. The same expensive material Zeph had identified as alchemical equipment.

Cornelius's memory supplied the image with painful clarity: crushed glass shards scattered across Dr. Floros's desk. Evidence he had noted and then dismissed as her own mess.

He had been wrong then.

He picked up the shard carefully, holding it to the beetle-light.

Fresh break. Sharp edges. No weathering.

Dropped recently.

By someone carrying laboratory equipment.

Someone who had been here within the last hour.

Someone who had overpowered Orestes and left him bound and drugged.

Behind him, Orestes made a sound.

Not quite a groan. More like stone grinding against stone.

Cornelius turned.

The hermit's eyes had opened to slits. His head moved slightly, seeking orientation.

"Do not move quickly," Cornelius said. "You were drugged. Your system needs time to—"

"Lizard." Orestes's voice came out slurred. Thick. "You... came."

"I followed Kyriakos Vlahos from the Festival. I saw him heading toward—" Cornelius stopped. "Did he do this to you?"

Orestes's eyes struggled to focus. "False... Gardener."

"Yes. Kyriakos. The perfumer. Did he—"

"Waited." Orestes's hand moved weakly toward the cliff edge. "There. Watching. For the bloom."

Cornelius's tail lashed once. "Where is he now?"

"Down." Orestes managed to lift one finger, pointing toward the tide pools below the alcove. "Went... down. When I..." His words trailed off. His eyes started to drift closed again.

"Stay conscious," Cornelius ordered. "You need to remain awake. The chloroform—"

"Knows." Orestes forced the word out. "Knows I... guard it. Could not... let me... interfere."

"He attacked you."

A weak nod. "From behind. Cloth over... mouth. I tried to... merge with stone but... too fast. Chemical worked... too fast."

Cornelius's claws curled against the limestone. "When?"

"Before... moon reached... zenith. Maybe... one hour?" Orestes's thermal signature was slowly climbing back toward normal baseline. The chloroform was wearing off. "He said... midnight. When the Orchid... opens."

"Opens?"

"Blooms." Orestes's eyes focused slightly better. "Full bloom. Midnight. Full moon and... lowest tide. The petals... unfold. Release the..." He struggled for breath. "The scent."

"The Moon-Scented Orchid releases its scent at the moment of full bloom," Cornelius translated. His mind was already cataloging the implications. "That is what Kyriakos wants. Not just the plant itself. The scent."

"He called it..." Orestes coughed wetly. "Harvesting the... breath. Said the living scent... was worth ten times... a preserved cutting."

Cornelius's scales went cold.

Not metaphorically cold.

Physically cold as his circulation diverted heat to his core in response to sudden understanding.

Kyriakos was not just stealing a botanical specimen.

He was planning to harvest the Orchid's scent at the exact moment of bloom.

The living fragrance of a plant that only flowered once every fifty years.

The rarest possible perfume ingredient.

Worth a fortune to the right buyers.

And if Kyriakos captured the scent—enclosed the bloom in some kind of vessel, trapped the fragrance chemically—

The Orchid would die.

Not eventually. Not from being picked.

Immediately.

Smothered.

"He brought equipment," Cornelius said. The words came out flat. Certain. "Laboratory glass. Specialized apparatus for capturing volatile compounds. That is why you found borosilicate shards. That is what he dropped in Dr. Floros's room when he stole her journal."

Orestes nodded weakly. "Saw his... bag. Full of... glass bottles. Tubes. Metal clamps." His hand moved toward his throat in a helpless gesture. "Going to... cage it. Trap the... living breath. Bottle it like... like..."

"Like death masked as luxury," Cornelius finished. His tail lashed again. "Like crushed flowers left to rot in sugar."

"Yes." Orestes's eyes held fury despite the drug haze. "Told him... told him the Orchid was... not his to take. That the bloom was... sacred. Meant to live... one night and... die free."

"What did he say?"

Orestes's expression twisted with disgust. "Laughed. Said I was... a fool who... preferred poverty to... prosperity. That beauty was... wasted if not... owned."

Cornelius's breath weapon flickered briefly at the back of his throat. A tiny blue flame of pure rage.

He suppressed it.

Flames were not useful here.

Information was useful.

"What time is it now?" he asked.

Orestes squinted up at the sky. The moon was visible between cloud gaps, nearly at its zenith. "Quarter to... eleven bells. Maybe."

Cornelius's internal chronometer agreed. He had left the Festival around twenty past nine bells. Followed Kyriakos along the coastal path. Climbed to Widow's Perch.

Ten forty-five, approximately.

Seventy-five minutes until midnight.

Seventy-five minutes until the Orchid bloomed.

Seventy-five minutes to stop Kyriakos from smothering a once-in-fifty-years natural phenomenon for profit.

"Can you stand?" Cornelius asked.

Orestes tried to push himself upright. Failed. His arms trembled. "Not... yet. Still weak."

"Then stay here. I will—"

"No." Orestes grabbed Cornelius's foreleg with surprising strength. "You cannot... go down there. Alone. He has... the chemical. If he used it... on me, he will... use it on you."

"I am smaller. Faster. He will not—"

"You are a fool," Orestes said flatly. His voice was gaining strength as the drug cleared his system. "A brave fool. But still a fool." He leveraged himself into a sitting position, breathing hard. "The path down... is trapped."

Cornelius went still. "Trapped how?"

"Wire. Across the... narrow section. Thin steel wire at... ankle height for... someone descending. I saw him... string it while I was... tied here. Could not... warn anyone." Orestes's hand tightened on Cornelius's leg. "If you go down... fast, you will... trip. Fall. Three hundred... feet to the... tide pools."

"Then I will go slowly."

"No time." Orestes managed a bitter smile. "He planned it... perfectly. Disable the... guardian. Trap the path. Wait for... midnight. Take his... prize and leave... while I lay here... helpless."

Cornelius's claws scraped against stone.

Kyriakos had outmaneuvered them.

Outmaneuvered everyone.

Stolen the journal. Used its maps and research to locate the Orchid. Arrived early enough to neutralize Orestes and secure his position. Set traps to prevent interference.

And now he waited below with his laboratory apparatus, ready to cage the bloom the moment it opened.

Seventy-five minutes.

"Can you merge with the stone yet?" Cornelius asked. "Travel through the cliff face to the pools below?"

Orestes shook his head. "Not while the... chloroform is still... in my blood. Merging requires... full control of... my physiology. I am too... unstable. I would get... stuck. Trapped inside... the stone."

"Then we need another approach."

"There is no... other approach. The path is... the only way down... unless you can fly... directly to the pools. But the wind..." Orestes gestured at the howling gale that tore past the alcove. "You saw it. Felt it. Even a... dragon cannot fly... in that. You would be... dashed against the... cliffs."

Cornelius's wings shifted against his sides.

Orestes was right.

The wind was too strong for controlled flight. The cliff face too vertical and jagged for safe gliding. And the darkness made navigation nearly impossible even with his heat-sense.

Trying to fly down would be suicide.

But the path was trapped.

And they had seventy-five minutes.

"There has to be a way," Cornelius said. His mind raced through possibilities, cataloging and discarding options with the same methodical process he used for shelving decisions. "Could you—if I helped you stand—could you remove the wire from here? Telekinetically or through stone manipulation?"

"I am dryad-touched. Not a mage." Orestes coughed again. "I merge with... living stone. I do not... control it at a distance."

"What about alerting someone in town? Captain Theo could send Watch officers. They could—"

"Arrive in an... hour at best. Too late." Orestes pulled himself fully upright, leaning heavily against the cliff wall. "You need to... go now. Before midnight. Before the... bloom opens."

"I cannot fly in this wind. The path is trapped. You just said—"

"I said you... could not fly to... the pools." Orestes's eyes focused more clearly now. Some of his usual sharpness returned to his expression. "I did not... say you could not... fly to the wire."

Cornelius went very still.

"The wire is... fifty feet down," Orestes continued. "Strung across the... narrowest section of... the path. You could... glide that far. Even in the wind. Land above it. Descend on foot... from there. Carefully."

"And then what? Kyriakos will see me coming. He has chloroform. He could—"

"He is watching... the pools. Not the path." Orestes's voice gained conviction. "I saw where he... positioned himself. In the... shadow of the... rock formation beside... the largest pool. His attention is... on the Orchid. Waiting for... first petal-movement. He will not... expect interference from... above."

Cornelius's tail curled and uncurled as he processed this.

Fifty-foot glide in dangerous wind.

Land on a narrow cliff path in darkness.

Descend carefully past the wire trap.

Approach an armed criminal who had already demonstrated willingness to use chemical weapons.

Stop him from smothering a priceless natural phenomenon.

All in seventy-five minutes.

This was a terrible plan.

"You have a... better idea?" Orestes asked, reading his expression.

"No."

"Then you should... go."

Cornelius looked at the hermit. Orestes was still pale. Still weak. But his thermal signature was steadily approaching normal baseline. The chloroform was clearing.

"If I fail," Cornelius said quietly, "you will recover in time to—"

"If you fail... the Orchid dies." Orestes's voice was hard. "And the False... Gardener walks away... with his prize. And next time... he will be more... careful. More thorough. He will not... leave witnesses alive."

The implication hung in the air between them.

Kyriakos had left Orestes alive this time because he believed the hermit would remain unconscious until long after midnight. Until long after Kyriakos had taken his prize and departed.

But if he felt threatened?

If he realized his plan was compromised?

A man who would drug and bind an elderly hermit would not hesitate to push that same hermit off a cliff.

"Go," Orestes said. "Stop him. Save the... Orchid. That is all... that matters."

Cornelius wanted to argue.

Wanted to express the many ways this plan could fail catastrophically.

Wanted to point out that he was a librarian, not a hero, and his recent investigative record demonstrated spectacular failures in judgment.

But Orestes was right.

The Orchid mattered.

Dr. Floros's stolen life work mattered.

Stopping Kyriakos from turning beauty into possession mattered.

Even if Cornelius was wrong again.

Even if he failed again.

He had to try.

"Seventy-five minutes," he said.

"Seventy-three now," Orestes corrected. He managed a thin smile. "You are wasting... time."

Cornelius moved to the alcove's edge.

The wind immediately tried to shove him backward. His claws dug into the limestone. His wings spread slightly, testing the air currents.

Chaotic.

Unpredictable.

Exactly the conditions he had struggled with during his first visit to Widow's Perch.

"The wire is... fifty feet down," Orestes called over the wind. "On the path's... right side. Knee-height for a... human. You will see it... if you look... carefully."

Cornelius nodded. His heat-sense was useless for detecting steel wire. He would have to rely on vision alone.

In darkness.

In wind-driven spray.

While gliding.

This was absolutely a terrible plan.

Cornelius launched.

The wind caught him immediately, shoving him sideways toward the open ocean. His wings angled hard, fighting for control. The cliff face blurred past too fast.

Twenty feet down.

Thirty.

The path below was a dark line against darker stone.

Forty feet.

The wind gusted. Cornelius's left wing folded involuntarily. He spun.

Forty-five feet.

He could not see the wire.

Could not see anything except stone and spray and darkness.

Fifty feet.

Now.

Cornelius folded his wings completely and dropped the last six feet straight down.

His claws hit the path hard. Too hard. He rolled, scraping scales against limestone, and fetched up against the cliff wall with his tail hanging over the edge into empty air.

For a moment he just lay there, breathing hard.

That had been deeply undignified.

Also effective.

He was alive. On the path. Below the alcove where Orestes waited.

Cornelius pulled himself fully onto the path and stood carefully.

His heat-sense swept the area below.

There.

Fifty feet further down, where the path curved around a rock outcropping.

A warm thermal signature. Human-sized. Satyr-kin physiology.

Sitting motionless beside the tide pools.

Kyriakos.

Waiting for midnight.

Waiting for the bloom.

Cornelius looked back up at the alcove. He could barely see Orestes's shape against the cliff wall.

Seventy-three minutes until midnight.

Cornelius turned and began his descent.

Carefully.

Silently.

Toward the False Gardener who had stolen Dr. Floros's life work and now planned to smother the Moon-Scented Orchid for profit.

The Hunt continued.

And this time, Cornelius would not fail.

He could not fail.

Too much depended on it.

Everything depended on it.

His claws found purchase on the stone.

The wind howled.

The ocean crashed below.

And somewhere in the darkness ahead, a once-in-fifty-years bloom prepared to open its petals under the full moon.

Cornelius crept forward.

Step by careful step.

Toward the wire.

Toward Kyriakos.

Toward either redemption or another catastrophic failure.

He would know which in seventy-three minutes.

# Chapter 14

# Chapter 14

"Boss!"

Zeph's voice cut through the Festival noise from somewhere behind the silk pavilion tents. Cornelius folded his wings and dropped from the lantern post where he had landed after his frantic glide back from Widow's Perch.

His claws hit packed earth. His scales were still damp from ocean spray. His spectacles sat crooked on his snout.

He did not care.

Seventy minutes until midnight.

Seventy minutes until Kyriakos smothered the Moon-Scented Orchid for profit.

Cornelius scrambled toward Zeph's voice, weaving between tent stakes and discarded Festival debris. The Twinkle beetles provided just enough light to navigate by. Their blue-green glow pulsed in rhythm with the distant music.

He rounded the corner of a purple silk tent and found Zeph standing with Sophia in a small clearing between pavilions. They were still holding hands.

Good.

That could wait.

"Kyriakos attacked Orestes," Cornelius said without preamble. His breath came short from the flight. "Drugged him with chloroform. Left him bound on the cliff. He is going after the Orchid right now."

Zeph's hand dropped from Sophia's. "Wait, what? The perfumer? But you cleared him. You said—"

"I was wrong." The words came easier this time. Faster. "He has Dr. Floros's stolen journal. He set a wire trap on the path down to the tide pools. He is waiting there with laboratory equipment for the bloom at midnight."

Sophia's thermal signature spiked. "Laboratory equipment?"

"Glass apparatus. Specialized bottles and tubes." Cornelius's tail lashed. "I found a shard at the cliff. Borosilicate. Same as the fragments in Dr. Floros's room."

"Let me see it." Sophia's voice carried an edge Cornelius had not heard before. Not anger. Something sharper. Professional focus.

He carefully extracted the glass shard from where he had wedged it between his scales for safekeeping during the flight. The fragment caught beetle-light, glinting blue-green.

Sophia took it from his claw and held it close to her face. Her fingers traced the curved edge. The break pattern. The thickness.

Her expression changed.

"Oh no," she said quietly. "Oh no, no, no."

"What?" Zeph moved closer to her. "What is it?"

"This is mine." Sophia's hand closed around the shard. Her knuckles went white. "This is from the prototype I made for him. The one he commissioned last month."

Cornelius went very still. "Commissioned?"

"He came to our guild." Sophia's words came faster now. Angrier. "Said he needed specialized glassware for a 'delicate botanical project.' Wanted containers that could capture and preserve volatile aromatic compounds without degradation. He was very specific about the requirements."

"What requirements?" Cornelius asked.

Sophia turned the shard over in her palm. "Airtight seal. Lead-reinforced rim to prevent vapor escape. Internal coating resistant to organic acids. And—" She stopped. Her thermal signature flared hotter. "And a one-way valve system that allows gases to enter but prevents them from leaving once the seal is set."

The pieces assembled in Cornelius's mind with terrible clarity.

"He is not stealing the Orchid," he said slowly. "He is going to trap its scent."

"Worse." Sophia's voice was tight. "The Orchid releases pheromones when it blooms. That is what creates the fragrance. Those pheromones are meant to attract a specific pollinator—probably something nocturnal that only appears during the full moon."

"A moth," Zeph said suddenly. "I read about it in one of the botanical texts. The Moon-Moth. It only flies during certain lunar phases."

Sophia nodded. "If Kyriakos captures the pheromones in this jar before the moth arrives—"

"The Orchid will not be pollinated," Cornelius finished. His scales prickled cold. "It blooms once every fifty years. If it misses this pollination window—"

"Extinction." The word came from behind them.

Cornelius spun.

Orestes stood at the edge of the clearing, leaning heavily against a tent pole. His face was still too pale. His breathing still labored. But his eyes burned with the same fury Cornelius had seen in the alcove.

"The Orchid has been declining for centuries," Orestes continued. "There used to be dozens of sites along this coast. Now there is only one. This bloom—" He coughed wetly. "This bloom might be the last chance for the species to reproduce."

"And Kyriakos knows that," Sophia said. Her hand tightened on the glass shard until Cornelius worried it might cut her. "He knows that if he captures this bloom's pheromones, he will have the only sample. Forever. No one else could create the fragrance. It would be completely unique."

"Exclusive," Cornelius said. The word tasted bitter. "Worth a fortune to collectors who value rarity above all else."

"Worth more if it is the last one," Orestes added. "A perfume made from an extinct flower. The ultimate luxury. The ultimate proof of wealth and status."

Zeph made a disgusted sound. "That is sick."

"That is Kyriakos." Sophia's voice carried personal weight. Old anger. "He steals things that cannot be replaced. My family's glaze formula. Dr. Floros's research. And now—" She looked at the glass shard in her palm. "Now he is going to steal an entire species' future."

Silence fell over the clearing.

Around them, the Festival continued. Music and laughter and the soft pulse of beetle-light. People celebrating Twinkle Nights without knowledge that fifty feet below the cliffs, a man prepared to commit botanical murder for profit.

Cornelius's mind raced through options.

Captain Theo. Call the Watch. Present evidence. Make arrests.

Except.

Theo had explicitly ordered Cornelius to stop wasting Watch resources on unfounded accusations. Had documented Cornelius's previous failures. Had made it clear that any further interference would result in charges.

And even if Theo believed him this time—which seemed unlikely given Cornelius's record—gathering Watch officers and reaching the tide pools would take at least an hour.

They had sixty-five minutes until midnight.

Maybe sixty now.

Not enough time.

"We cannot get the Watch there in time," Cornelius said aloud. The admission felt like failure. Like another mistake in a long series of mistakes. "Even if Captain Theo believed me—"

"He would not," Orestes interrupted. "Not after this morning. You accused the wrong man. Publicly. With ceremony."

The words stung because they were true.

Cornelius had burned his credibility with Theo. With the Watch. With anyone who might have helped.

This morning's humiliation in the reading room had cost him more than professional pride. It had cost him institutional support exactly when he needed it most.

He had done this to himself.

"So what do we do?" Zeph asked. "Just let him get away with it?"

"No." Sophia's voice was flat. Certain. "We stop him ourselves."

Cornelius looked at her. At Zeph. At Orestes still leaning on the tent pole, barely recovered from chloroform exposure.

They were not Watch officers.

They were a tile artist with a grudge. A library intern. A drugged hermit. And a disgraced librarian whose investigative instincts had proven catastrophically unreliable.

This was not a team.

This was a disaster waiting to happen.

Except.

Except Sophia knew glass. Knew exactly what apparatus Kyriakos was using and how it worked.

Zeph knew the coastal paths. Had grown up exploring the cliffs and tide pools.

Orestes knew the Orchid. Had guarded it for decades. Understood its biology and ecology in ways no book could teach.

And Cornelius—

Cornelius could fly. Could see in darkness with heat-sense. Could fit through spaces humans could not. Could breathe fire if necessary.

Small fire.

Very small fire.

But fire nonetheless.

"The wire trap," Cornelius said slowly. "Can you disable it?"

Orestes shook his head. "Not in my current condition. The chloroform is still interfering with my ability to merge with stone. I would need to approach the wire physically, and I—" He gestured at his trembling hands. "I would likely trigger it."

"I could do it," Zeph offered. "If someone told me where it was."

"Too dangerous," Cornelius said automatically. Then stopped himself.

That was the old pattern. The old Cornelius who worked alone. Who trusted only his own judgment.

The same Cornelius who had wrongly accused Brother Demos. Who had staged a theatrical reading room confrontation based on incomplete evidence. Who had lost Imelda's respect and Theo's cooperation.

Working alone had failed.

Spectacularly.

Multiple times.

"Actually," Cornelius said carefully, "if Orestes could guide you from above with precise directions, and if you moved slowly, checking each step—"

"I can do that," Zeph said. His voice carried new confidence. The same confidence he had shown when talking to Sophia about art and science. When giving her the gift. When kissing her.

When being brave about things that mattered.

"The jar," Sophia said. "Even if we reach Kyriakos, we need to stop him from sealing it. Once the lead rim locks, the pheromones are trapped. But—" She examined the glass shard again. "The seal requires heat. Specific, focused heat applied to the rim for exactly thirty seconds to activate the lead bonding."

"What kind of heat source?" Cornelius asked.

"He commissioned a small alchemical torch from my guild along with the jar. Portable. Blue flame. Very precise temperature control."

"So if we prevent him from using the torch—" Zeph started.

"The jar stays open," Sophia finished. "The pheromones can escape. The moth can find the Orchid."

"And if we break the jar?" Cornelius asked.

Sophia shook her head. "Borosilicate is incredibly strong. You would need significant force or—" She paused. "Or you would need to heat one specific point to critical temperature and then apply rapid cooling. The thermal shock would shatter it."

"How hot?"

"Hotter than an alchemical torch. You would need—" Sophia looked at Cornelius. Her eyes widened slightly. "You would need dragon fire."

Cornelius's breath weapon flickered involuntarily at the back of his throat. A tiny blue flame barely larger than a candle's worth.

Not impressive.

Not powerful.

But very, very hot.

Library Dragons used their fire for precision work. Melting wax seals. Cauterizing torn pages. Fusing gold leaf to leather bindings.

Delicate applications requiring intense heat in small areas.

Exactly what Sophia described.

"I can do that," Cornelius said. "If I can get close enough to the jar."

"Kyriakos will not let you get close," Orestes said. "He has chloroform. If he used it on me, he will use it on you."

"Not if he does not see me coming." Cornelius's mind was already mapping the approach. The shadows near the tide pools. The rock formations Orestes had described. The wind that would carry any warning scent away from the pools rather than toward them. "I am small. Quiet. I can move through spaces humans cannot. And my heat-sense works in complete darkness."

"What about the wire?" Zeph asked.

"You disable it. With Orestes's guidance." Cornelius looked at the hermit. "Can you make it to the alcove above the pools? Direct Zeph from there?"

Orestes straightened slightly. His thermal signature was still weak but warming as the drug cleared his system. "Yes. If we move soon. Before I—" He swayed. Caught himself. "Before I lose more time to recovery."

"I am going too." Sophia's voice left no room for argument. "I know that glass. I designed it. If something goes wrong, I can—" She stopped. Started again more carefully. "I need to be there. He used my work to do this. My design. I need to help stop him."

Cornelius wanted to refuse. To say it was too dangerous. That she should stay at the Festival where it was safe.

But he thought about this morning. About making decisions alone. About being wrong.

About how every person here brought something essential.

"Alright," he said. "But we move carefully. We coordinate. We do not take unnecessary risks."

"Since when do you avoid unnecessary risks?" Zeph asked. "You crawled through air vents last night. You glided off a cliff in murder-wind twenty minutes ago."

"Since those unnecessary risks were mine alone to take." Cornelius met Zeph's eyes. Then Sophia's. Then Orestes's. "This time we work as a team. That means we keep each other safe."

The words felt strange. Unfamiliar.

Also right.

Also necessary.

"How much time do we have?" Sophia asked.

Cornelius checked the moon's position through a gap in the tent canopy. "Fifty-five minutes. Perhaps less."

"Then we need to move now." Orestes pushed away from the tent pole. His balance was poor but functional. "The coastal path is twenty minutes' walk from here. We need—"

"Fifteen if we run," Zeph interrupted. "I know a shortcut through the lower market."

"Twelve if I carry someone," Cornelius said. "I can manage short flights with a passenger if they are not too heavy."

"I am too heavy," Orestes said immediately. "And too unstable. I would unbalance you."

"Not me," Sophia said. She looked at Cornelius with calculation. "I weigh maybe ninety pounds. Could you—"

"Yes." Cornelius spread his wings, demonstrating wingspan. "It will be uncomfortable for both of us. But possible."

"Then Sophia flies with you," Zeph said. "Orestes and I take the shortcut on foot. We meet at the alcove above the pools."

"And then?" Sophia asked.

Cornelius's tail curled and uncurled as he organized the sequence. As he planned.

As he did what librarians did: created order from chaos.

"Orestes guides Zeph to the wire trap. Zeph disables it. That clears the path down to the pools." He looked at Sophia. "You and I approach Kyriakos's position from above using stealth. We locate the jar. I apply fire to create thermal stress. You tell me exactly where and how long. The jar shatters."

"And Kyriakos?" Orestes asked.

"We do not engage him directly unless necessary," Cornelius said. "We are not trying to arrest him. We are trying to save the Orchid."

"But if he tries to stop us—" Zeph started.

"Then we improvise." Cornelius looked at each of them in turn. "But the priority is always the bloom. Always the Orchid. Kyriakos can be dealt with later through proper channels and actual evidence. The Orchid only blooms tonight."

Sophia nodded slowly. "Save the flower first."

"Save the flower first," Cornelius confirmed.

The phrase settled over them like a vow.

"We should go now," Orestes said. "While I still can."

"Right." Zeph squared his shoulders. "Lower market shortcut. Fifteen minutes. Don't wait for us if we're late."

"We will not be late," Orestes said firmly.

Sophia looked at Cornelius. "I have never been carried by a dragon before."

"I have never carried a passenger before," Cornelius admitted. "This will be educational for both of us."

"Grand." Sophia's smile was tight. Nervous. "How do I—"

"Climb onto my back. Between my wings. Hold onto the base of my neck. Do not restrict my breathing."

Sophia crouched and carefully positioned herself across Cornelius's shoulders. Her weight settled evenly. Her hands found purchase just behind his jaw.

Uncomfortable.

Undignified.

But functional.

Cornelius's wings spread. His claws gripped the packed earth.

"Ready?" he asked.

"No," Sophia said. "But let's go anyway."

Cornelius launched.

His wings beat hard against the added weight. The initial lift was terrible. Graceless. He barely cleared the tent canopy.

But then the air caught properly beneath his wings. His flight stabilized. The Festival fell away below as he climbed toward the beetle swarms.

Sophia's grip tightened. "Oh gods. Oh gods. This is insane."

"Focus on the horizon," Cornelius advised. "Do not look down. Breathe steadily."

"Right. Horizon. Breathing. Not looking at the extremely long drop to the—I looked down."

"Stop looking down."

"Stopping now."

Cornelius angled northwest. The coastal path appeared below, a dark line against darker cliffs. Ahead, Widow's Perch rose like a stone finger pointing at the moon.

Fifty minutes until midnight.

Fifty minutes to save a flower.

To stop a collector who valued possession over existence.

To prove that beauty did not need to be owned to matter.

Cornelius's wings beat steadily. The wind from the ocean fought each stroke. Sophia's weight made every adjustment harder. More deliberate.

But they were flying.

Actually flying.

Toward the Orchid.

Toward Kyriakos.

Toward either redemption or another catastrophic failure.

Except this time Cornelius was not alone.

This time he had a team.

A strange team.

A team assembled from failure and grudges and botanical desperation.

But a team nonetheless.

"How much farther?" Sophia asked. Her voice was steadier now. Adjusting to the flight.

"Three minutes to the alcove," Cornelius estimated. "Then we wait for Zeph and Orestes."

"And then?"

"Then we save the Orchid."

"Just like that?"

"Just like that."

Sophia was quiet for several wingbeats. Then: "Thank you. For not leaving this alone. For chasing the pattern even after—" She hesitated. "Even after this morning."

"The pattern was wrong this morning," Cornelius said. "Brother Demos was innocent."

"But you were right about the perfume. About the glass. About Kyriakos."

"Eventually."

"Eventually counts." Sophia's hands shifted slightly on his neck. "Zeph told me about Code Obsidian. About Captain Theo's reprimand. About how you almost quit this case."

"I should have quit. My interference made everything worse."

"Your interference is the only reason we know Kyriakos is at the tide pools right now." Sophia's voice was firm. "Maybe you got some details wrong. Maybe you accused the wrong person. But you kept looking. You kept trying. And now you are here."

"We are here," Cornelius corrected.

"Right. We."

The word felt significant.

We.

Not I.

Not alone.

Widow's Perch resolved from darkness ahead. The alcove appeared as a deeper shadow against the cliff face. Cornelius angled his approach, fighting the wind for every foot of altitude.

This time when he landed, Sophia was already braced for the impact. They hit the alcove's stone surface together and rolled once before Cornelius's claws found purchase.

Sophia climbed off his back. Her legs trembled slightly. "That was horrible."

"You did well."

"I almost vomited twice."

"But you did not actually vomit. That is what matters."

Sophia laughed. The sound was shaky but genuine. "Dragon logic."

"The only reliable kind."

Below, somewhere in the darkness, Kyriakos waited beside the largest tide pool with his stolen journal and his specially commissioned glass jar.

Waiting for midnight.

Waiting for the bloom.

Waiting to trap beauty in a bottle and let a species die.

Cornelius's scales prickled with cold fury.

Not this time.

Not while he could still fly.

Not while he still had fire.

"They are coming," Sophia said, pointing toward the coastal path.

Two thermal signatures approached. Moving quickly despite the darkness. Despite the dangerous footing.

Zeph and Orestes.

The team was assembling.

The Hunt continued.

And this time—this time—Cornelius would not fail.

Could not fail.

Too much depended on it.

Everything depended on it.

The Orchid.

Dr. Floros's stolen work.

The Moon-Moth that would arrive expecting pheromones and finding only empty air if they failed.

Fifty years until the next bloom.

Fifty years the species did not have.

This was their chance.

Their only chance.

Cornelius's wings folded against his sides.

His claws gripped stone.

His breath weapon flickered ready at the back of his throat.

"When Zeph and Orestes arrive," he said quietly, "we begin."

Sophia nodded. Her hand still held the glass shard. Her expression was set. Determined.

"We do not go to arrest him," Cornelius said. "We go to save the flower."

"To save the flower," Sophia repeated.

And below them in the darkness, the Moon-Scented Orchid prepared to bloom.

# Chapter 15

"Wait." Sophia's hand shot out, stopping Cornelius mid-step. "Wait. Something is wrong."

Cornelius froze. His claws gripped the alcove's limestone edge. Below, Zeph and Orestes were approaching along the coastal path, their thermal signatures bright against the cold stone.

"What?" Cornelius asked.

Sophia was staring at the glass shard in her palm. The fragment caught beetle-light, throwing tiny reflections across her fingers.

"The jar," she said slowly. "He commissioned it for 'capturing volatile aromatic compounds.'" Her voice changed. Sharpened. "That was the exact phrase he used. Volatile aromatic compounds."

"Yes. The Orchid's pheromones." Cornelius's tail curled impatiently. They had forty-eight minutes. Every second spent talking was a second closer to midnight. "We established—"

"No." Sophia turned the shard over. "Pheromones are gases. They disperse. Even if he captured them in this jar, they would degrade within hours. Days at most. You cannot bottle a scent that way. Not permanently."

Cornelius went still.

Actually still.

The kind of predatory stillness that happened when his mind caught something important.

"Perfumes are made from extracted oils," Sophia continued. Her words came faster now. Urgent. "Essential oils. Concentrated compounds that you dilute into alcohol or carrier substances. You cannot make a perfume from air. You need biological matter. Plant tissue."

"He could press the petals," Cornelius said. But even as he spoke, his mind was already moving ahead. Already seeing the problem. "Extract the oils after the bloom."

"The Orchid blooms for one night." Sophia's knuckles were white around the glass shard. "One night every fifty years. Even if he pressed every petal immediately, the yield would be minuscule. A few drops at most. Not enough for a commercial perfume. Not enough for the 'ultimate luxury' Orestes described."

Cornelius's scales prickled cold.

"Unless," he said quietly, "he takes the entire plant."

Sophia nodded. "Unless he takes the bulb."

The words hung in the air between them.

Below, Zeph and Orestes reached the base of the cliff. Their voices drifted up, too quiet to distinguish words. Just the sound of humans navigating stone in darkness.

"That is why he needed the journal," Cornelius said. His mind was cataloging implications with terrible speed. "Not for the map. He knew where the Orchid was. Orestes said the False Gardener had been here before. Watching. Waiting."

"Then why steal it?" Sophia asked. "If he already knew the location—"

"Because location is insufficient for transplantation." Cornelius's claws scraped against limestone. "Dr. Floros's journal contains fifty years of botanical field research. Including—" His breath caught. "Including the specific environmental conditions required to keep rare coastal specimens alive."

"Soil composition," Sophia said. "Fungal symbiosis. Mycorrhizal relationships."

"Yes." Cornelius's tail lashed once. Hard. "The Orchid grows here because of something in this specific location. The limestone. The ocean spray. The particular blend of minerals and microorganisms in the tide pool soil. Dr. Floros would have documented all of it. Studied it. Recorded the exact conditions."

"So Kyriakos could recreate them." Sophia's voice was flat. Furious. "In a greenhouse. In a controlled environment where he owns the only living specimen."

"And harvests it on his own schedule," Cornelius finished. "Every fifty years. Forever. A renewable source of the rarest perfume ingredient in existence."

The implications assembled like a perfectly organized catalog.

Kyriakos was not planning to smother the bloom.

He was planning to steal the future.

All of it.

Every bloom for the next thousand years.

"That is why he brought laboratory equipment," Cornelius said. His voice sounded distant to his own ears. Analytical. The tone he used when examining particularly damaged manuscripts. "Not just the collection jar. He would need tools for excavating the bulb. Soil sample containers. Perhaps even portable cold storage to keep the mycorrhizal fungi viable during transport."

"He has been planning this for months," Sophia said. "Since before he commissioned the jar. Since—" She stopped. Her thermal signature flared hotter. "Since he stole my family's glaze formula."

Cornelius looked at her.

"The theft," Sophia continued, her words clipped and precise, "happened eight months ago. Right after the University of Khariton published a paper about rare coastal flora. My mother mentioned it. Said a wealthy client had become very interested in botanical preservation techniques."

"Kyriakos."

"Kyriakos." Sophia's hand tightened on the glass shard. "He started researching immediately. Found out about the Orchid. About Dr. Floros's work. And then he began acquiring everything he needed. My glaze formula for specialized ceramics. Laboratory glass from my guild. Access to academic archives." Her voice dropped. "Probably bribes. Probably more thefts we do not even know about yet."

"All leading to tonight," Cornelius said.

"All leading to tonight."

Zeph's voice drifted up from below. "Boss? You still up there?"

Cornelius moved to the alcove edge. "We are here."

"Good. Orestes is—" Zeph stopped talking. Started again. "Orestes is not doing great. The chloroform is still messing with his balance. We need to move soon or he is going to collapse."

Cornelius looked at Sophia. "We need to revise the plan."

"Why?" Sophia asked. "If he is taking the bulb instead of just the scent, does that change—"

"Everything," Cornelius interrupted. "It changes everything."

He moved back from the edge, giving himself space to think.

The original plan had been simple. Elegant. Approach from above. Shatter the collection jar with dragon fire. Release the pheromones. Let the Moon-Moth find the Orchid naturally.

But if Kyriakos was excavating the bulb—

"He will not be watching the bloom," Cornelius said. "He will be digging."

"Which means he is not positioned by the largest pool like Orestes said." Sophia's eyes widened. "He moved. He is wherever the Orchid actually grows."

"And we do not know where that is." Cornelius's tail lashed again. "The journal had maps. Detailed drawings. But I never saw them. Never studied them. I only know the Orchid is somewhere in the tide pools. That could be anywhere within a hundred-foot radius."

"Orestes knows," Sophia said. "He is the guardian. He would know exactly—"

"Orestes can barely walk," Cornelius countered. "And even if he could guide us from the alcove, we would need to search the pools systematically. In darkness. While Kyriakos digs up a fifty-year-old bulb."

The timeline was collapsing.

They had forty-five minutes until midnight.

Maybe less.

And they were still at the top of the cliff with no clear path to the Orchid and no way to know if they could reach it before Kyriakos finished his excavation.

"We need more people," Sophia said. "Captain Theo. The Watch. We should—"

"No." The word came out sharper than Cornelius intended. "Theo will not believe me. Not after this morning. Not after Brother Demos. And even if he did, gathering Watch officers and reaching the pools would take—" He calculated quickly. "Ninety minutes. Perhaps more given the Festival crowds."

"Then what?" Sophia's frustration matched his own. "We just let him take it?"

Cornelius's claws scraped against stone.

No.

No, he would not let Kyriakos take it.

Would not let a collector steal fifty years of Dr. Floros's work and use it to cage a species for profit.

Would not let beauty be reduced to possession.

There had to be a way.

Some route. Some approach. Some—

The rooftops.

The thought arrived fully formed.

Cornelius's heat-sense had mapped Solterra Bay from above dozens of times. Hundreds of times. He knew every thermal vent. Every chimney. Every gap between buildings where the warmth from human habitation created updrafts.

He knew the Dragon's Route.

"The coastal path is blocked by Festival crowds," Cornelius said slowly. His mind was already tracing the route. Already calculating distances and wind patterns. "But the rooftops are empty."

Sophia stared at him. "The rooftops."

"I can fly along the ridgeline. Above the market. Above the crowds." Cornelius's wings spread slightly, testing the concept. "The wind is strong but manageable at that altitude. And from the old customs house roof, there is a direct line to Widow's Perch."

"How direct?" Sophia asked.

"Two hundred feet. Mostly vertical. But climbable."

"Climbable for a dragon," Sophia said. "Not for humans."

"No." Cornelius looked at her. "You and Orestes take the coastal path. Move as quickly as Orestes can manage. You will arrive later than me, but you will arrive."

"And what will you do when you get there alone?" Sophia's voice carried the same sharp edge she used when discussing stolen glaze formulas. "Kyriakos has chloroform. Laboratory tools. He has already proven he will drug or restrain anyone who interferes. You are the size of a large cat. He could—"

"I will not engage him directly," Cornelius said. The plan was forming with crystalline clarity now. The kind of perfect organizational structure he usually reserved for alphabetization schemes. "I will locate the Orchid. Verify its position. And then—" He paused. "Then I will prevent the excavation."

"How?"

"I breathe fire."

Sophia's expression shifted. "You would burn it?"

"No. I would make it impossible to dig." Cornelius's tail curled and uncurled as he worked through the specifics. "Bulbs grow in soil. Soil mixed with organic matter and fungal networks. If I apply sufficient heat to the surrounding substrate, I can fuse the top layer. Create a hardened crust. Like pottery in a kiln."

"You would bake the soil," Sophia said slowly. "Seal the bulb underground."

"Temporarily. Until you and Orestes arrive. Until we can coordinate a proper defense." Cornelius looked toward the Festival lights below. "It will not be permanent. But it will buy us time. Force Kyriakos to either abandon the attempt or commit to a much longer excavation. Hours instead of minutes."

"And if he has tools that can break through baked earth?"

"Then I improvise." Cornelius met her eyes. "But the alternative is letting him take the bulb. Now. Tonight. Without any resistance at all."

Sophia was quiet for a long moment.

Then she nodded. "Go."

Cornelius moved to the alcove edge. "Zeph!" he called down. "I am going ahead. Take Orestes along the coastal path. Move as fast as you can."

"What?" Zeph's thermal signature shifted in confusion. "Why? What happened?"

"Kyriakos is taking the whole bulb. We need to reach him before he finishes digging it up."

"Then we should all—"

"The crowds block the main path. I am taking the rooftops."

Silence from below.

Then: "Boss. The rooftops are twenty feet above the market. With no railings. In darkness. During a windstorm."

"I am aware."

"You are going to kill yourself."

"I am going to save the Orchid," Cornelius corrected. "You are going to escort Orestes safely to the tide pools and arrive in time to help Sophia disable any equipment Kyriakos might have already positioned."

More silence.

Then Zeph said something that sounded very much like a creative application of nautical terminology.

"Your objection is noted," Cornelius said. "Now move. We have forty-three minutes."

He turned back to Sophia. "When you reach the pools, look for hardened soil. That is where I will be. Where the Orchid grows."

"Understood." Sophia straightened. Squared her shoulders. "Cornelius?"

"Yes?"

"Do not die on the rooftops. Zeph would never forgive you."

"I have no intention of dying anywhere."

"Good."

Sophia disappeared over the alcove edge, descending to join Zeph and Orestes.

Cornelius was alone.

He spread his wings fully. Felt the wind try to catch the membrane. Felt the familiar resistance of air against scale.

The Dragon's Route.

He had flown it in daylight. In calm weather. With full visibility and no time pressure.

This was none of those things.

This was darkness. Beetle-light. Gale-force wind. And a ticking clock.

Cornelius launched.

The wind hit him immediately. Tried to shove him toward the ocean. His wings compensated, angling hard. The cliff face blurred past.

Down.

Too fast.

His heat-sense mapped the buildings below. The market. The tavern. The customs house with its flat roof and—

There.

A thermal vent. Warm air rising from a bakery chimney.

Cornelius angled into the updraft. The warm air caught his wings. Lifted him.

He climbed.

Ten feet.

Twenty.

The rooftops appeared below. Terra-cotta tiles slick with ocean spray. Gaps between buildings where festival-goers moved like warm shadows.

Cornelius leveled out. His wings found the rhythm. Stroke. Glide. Stroke. Glide.

The route unfolded in his mind with perfect clarity.

First: the tavern roof. Thirty feet ahead. Flat section with a chimney providing updraft.

Then: the guild hall. Fifty feet beyond that. Peaked roof requiring a brief climb.

Finally: the customs house. The launching point for Widow's Perch.

Cornelius flew.

The wind fought him. The darkness made navigation dependent entirely on heat-sense. But he had done this before.

Different circumstances.

Same route.

Same city.

His city.

The tavern roof appeared. Cornelius landed. His claws found purchase on tiles still warm from the day's retained heat.

He did not stop.

Launched again immediately. Toward the guild hall.

The peaked roof required actual climbing. His claws dug into terra-cotta. His wings folded tight against his sides. The wind tried to peel him off the tiles.

He reached the peak. Balanced there for one heartbeat.

Then descended the far side in a controlled glide.

The customs house waited fifty feet ahead.

Cornelius's wings beat harder. The wind was stronger here. Less predictable. The beetle swarms created pockets of disturbed air that made every stroke uncertain.

His heat-sense found the customs house roof.

Flat.

Empty.

Perfect.

Cornelius landed hard. Too hard. His claws scraped across stone. His tail whipped for balance.

He caught himself.

Stood.

And looked up.

Widow's Perch rose two hundred feet above the customs house. A vertical limestone wall broken by occasional ledges and outcroppings.

Climbable.

Barely.

Cornelius's wings folded against his sides. His claws extended fully. His tail positioned for counterbalance.

This was not flight.

This was climbing.

He started up.

The limestone was rough. Full of handholds. But slick with spray and darkness made each grip uncertain.

Fifty feet.

One hundred feet.

His wings ached from being held so tightly folded. His claws burned from gripping cold stone.

One hundred fifty feet.

The wind was murderous at this height. It tried to shove him off the cliff face. Tried to peel his claws from their holds.

Cornelius climbed.

One hundred seventy-five feet.

Almost there.

His heat-sense detected the alcove above. The same alcove where Orestes had been drugged. Where Sophia had waited while Cornelius descended to scout the wire trap.

Twenty feet remained.

Fifteen.

Ten.

Cornelius's claw found the alcove edge. He pulled himself up. Rolled onto flat stone.

For a moment he just lay there. Breathing hard. Wings trembling slightly from exertion.

Then he stood.

The tide pools spread below. Dark shapes against darker water. The moon reflected off their surfaces in silver fragments.

Somewhere down there, Kyriakos was digging.

Cornelius's heat-sense swept the area.

There.

A warm thermal signature. Human-sized. Kneeling beside the furthest pool.

Not moving.

Completely still.

Wrong.

That was wrong.

Kyriakos should be digging. Moving. Working frantically against the midnight deadline.

But the signature was motionless.

Waiting.

Cornelius's scales prickled.

This was a trap.

Kyriakos knew someone was coming.

Had prepared for interference.

Had positioned himself exactly where he could watch all approaches while appearing to be focused on the pools.

Cornelius crept to the alcove edge.

The path down was still there. Still trapped with the wire Orestes had warned about.

But there was another route.

A route only a dragon could take.

Cornelius spread his wings.

Then folded them again.

No.

Not yet.

He needed more information.

Needed to verify the Orchid's exact location before committing to a descent.

His heat-sense focused on the pools.

The thermal signature by the furthest pool was definitely Kyriakos. The physiology matched. Satyr-kin. Slightly warmer baseline than human.

But where was the Orchid?

Cornelius's eyes adjusted to the beetle-light. The pools appeared as dark crescents. Five of them. Ranging from ten feet across to barely three feet wide.

Which one held the Orchid?

His memory supplied Orestes's earlier description: "The largest pool."

But from this angle, in this light, Cornelius could not determine which pool was largest.

He needed to get closer.

Needed to—

Movement below.

The thermal signature shifted. Stood.

Kyriakos was moving.

Walking.

Not toward the pools.

Toward the path.

Walking directly toward where Zeph and Orestes would arrive.

Cornelius's breath weapon flickered at the back of his throat.

No.

He launched from the alcove.

Not a controlled glide.

A dive.

Straight down toward the tide pools with wings folded and claws extended.

The wind screamed past his scales.

The pools rushed up to meet him.

Thirty feet.

Twenty.

Ten.

Cornelius's wings snapped open.

The air caught them. Jerked him violently horizontal. His shoulder joints screamed in protest.

Five feet above the largest pool, Cornelius's wings beat hard. Once. Twice.

He landed on the pool's edge.

On stone slick with spray and algae.

His claws scrabbled for purchase.

Found it.

He crouched there. Wings spread for balance. Heat-sense sweeping the area.

Kyriakos was fifty feet away. Moving steadily toward the path. Toward Zeph and Orestes.

Which meant—

Cornelius looked down.

At the pool.

At the dark water reflecting beetle-light and moon.

And there.

Just visible below the surface.

Growing from a crack in the submerged limestone.

A plant.

Pale. Delicate. With leaves that seemed to glow faintly in the darkness.

The Moon-Scented Orchid.

It was tiny.

The whole plant barely eight inches tall.

Cornelius had expected something dramatic. Showy. Befitting a once-in-fifty-years bloom.

But the Orchid was small.

Almost invisible.

Unless you knew exactly where to look.

And Kyriakos knew.

Had studied Dr. Floros's journal.

Had memorized the maps.

Had come here prepared.

Cornelius's claws gripped the stone.

His breath weapon flickered ready.

He looked at the soil surrounding the pool.

Dark.

Organic.

Rich with the specific fungal networks Dr. Floros had documented.

The soil Kyriakos needed to keep the bulb alive after transplantation.

Cornelius took a breath.

Aimed carefully.

And breathed fire.

The tiny blue flame touched the soil.

And the Orchid's fate shifted from theft to siege.

# Chapter 16

# Chapter 16

The crowd was impossible.

Cornelius crouched on Zeph's shoulder, claws gripping fabric, while bodies pressed in from all sides. The Festival had turned Harbor Square into a solid mass of humans, satyrs, and orcs, all surging toward the lantern ceremony. 

Forty minutes until midnight.

Maybe less.

And they were trapped.

"This is not working," Cornelius said directly into Zeph's ear. His heat-sense showed nothing but warm bodies packed shoulder to shoulder. No gaps. No paths. No way through.

"I know." Zeph tried to push forward. A satyr vendor with a tray of roasted chestnuts blocked the way completely, arguing with someone about prices. "Excuse me. Pardon. We need to—"

No one moved.

No one was moving anywhere.

The coastal path was fifty feet ahead. Might as well have been fifty miles.

Cornelius's tail lashed in frustration. His breath weapon flickered involuntarily at the back of his throat.

They were losing time.

Kyriakos was already at the pools. Already digging. Already—

"The rooftops," Cornelius said.

Zeph stopped trying to push through the crowd. "What?"

"The rooftops are empty. Everyone is down here." Cornelius's mind was already tracing the route. The same path he had flown alone in Chapter 15. But this time he was not alone. "We go up."

"Boss, I cannot fly."

"No. But you can climb."

Zeph's thermal signature shifted. Uncertainty. "Climb what exactly?"

Cornelius extended one claw, pointing toward the building beside them. A two-story warehouse with barrels stacked against the wall. "There. The drainage pipe runs to the roof. From there we cross the guild hall. Then the customs house. Then the cliff."

"That is insane."

"That is our only option." Cornelius adjusted his grip on Zeph's shoulder. "Unless you prefer to stand here while Kyriakos steals the Orchid."

Zeph looked at the warehouse. At the crowd. At the distant cliffs barely visible past the lantern-light.

Then he moved.

Not toward the coastal path.

Toward the warehouse wall.

"You are completely insane," Zeph muttered. But he was already shoving through the crowd sideways, aiming for the narrow gap between buildings. "You know that, right?"

"I am efficient," Cornelius corrected. "There is a difference."

They reached the wall. The crowd thinned here. Most people were packed toward the square's center where the lantern ceremony would happen.

The drainage pipe was old iron. Riveted seams. Brackets anchoring it to limestone every six feet.

Climbable.

Probably.

"You are sure about this?" Zeph asked.

"No." Cornelius launched from Zeph's shoulder and landed on the first bracket. His claws gripped iron that was still warm from the day's retained heat. "But I am certain we have no alternative."

"That is not reassuring."

"I am a librarian, not a motivational speaker."

Zeph grabbed the pipe with both hands. Tested his weight.

The pipe held.

He started climbing.

Cornelius went first. His smaller size made the brackets easy to navigate. Claw over claw. Tail for balance. Wings folded tight against his sides.

Ten feet up.

Fifteen.

Below, the Festival continued. Music and laughter and the soft pulse of beetle-light. No one looked up. No one noticed two figures climbing a warehouse wall in darkness.

Twenty feet.

Zeph was keeping pace. His breathing was controlled. Steady. 

Cornelius's heat-sense tracked his progress. Hands gripping iron. Feet finding purchase on brackets. Moving with surprising confidence for someone who claimed to be afraid of heights.

"Where did you learn to climb?" Cornelius asked.

"Trees." Zeph pulled himself up another bracket. "When I was younger. There is a grove south of the market. We used to—" He caught himself. "Does not matter."

But it did matter.

Because Zeph was good at this.

Really good.

His movements were efficient. Practiced. The kind of muscle memory that came from years of scrambling up things that were not meant to be climbed.

They reached the roof.

Cornelius pulled himself over the edge first. The warehouse roof was flat. Covered in terra-cotta tiles that were slick with ocean spray but manageable.

Zeph hauled himself up beside him. "Okay. That was not terrible."

"The difficult part has not started yet." Cornelius moved to the roof's far edge. His heat-sense mapped the route ahead.

The guild hall was thirty feet away. Across an alley barely six feet wide.

Cornelius could glide it easily.

Zeph could not.

"There is a plank," Cornelius said, spotting it near the roof's corner. Someone had left a wide board there. Probably for maintenance work. "We use that as a bridge."

"That plank is maybe eight inches wide."

"Correct."

"And the drop is two stories."

"Also correct."

"Boss, I am not walking across an eight-inch plank in the dark."

Cornelius examined the alley below with his heat-sense. Empty. But the fall would be. Unpleasant. At minimum.

"Then we find another route," he said.

But there was no other route.

The crowd blocked the ground level. The buildings were spaced too far for Zeph to jump. And the coastal path was still gridlocked with Festival attendees.

They needed to cross this gap.

Somehow.

Cornelius studied the plank more carefully. It was positioned at the roof's edge, tied down with rope. Someone had definitely used it as a bridge before.

"It will hold your weight," Cornelius said. "The wood is sound."

"That is not the problem. The problem is I cannot balance on something that narrow while twenty feet in the air."

Cornelius's tail curled thoughtfully. Then: "What if I guide you?"

"How?"

"I fly beside you. If you start to fall, I—" He stopped. Reconsidered. "Actually, I cannot catch you. You weigh too much."

"Again. Not reassuring."

"But I can tell you when you are leaning incorrectly. My heat-sense can detect your balance shifting before you feel it."

Zeph looked at the plank. At the gap. At the guild hall roof beyond.

"This is a terrible idea," he said.

"I am open to better suggestions."

Silence.

Then Zeph moved to the plank. Started untying the ropes holding it down. "If I die, you have to tell Sophia it was heroic."

"If you die, the Orchid dies with you." Cornelius positioned himself at the plank's near end. "So do not die."

Together they maneuvered the plank across the gap. It was heavier than it looked. Solid oak. But the weight made it stable once positioned.

The far end settled onto the guild hall roof with a dull thunk.

Eight inches wide.

Six feet across empty air.

Zeph stared at it. "I hate this. I want you to know I hate this."

"Noted." Cornelius spread his wings. "Now walk."

"Just. Walk."

"Yes. One foot in front of the other. Do not look down. Do not think about the drop. Focus on the far edge."

"You are terrible at this."

"I am being efficient."

Zeph took a breath. Stepped onto the plank.

His first step was tentative. Testing. The wood barely flexed under his weight.

Second step. More confident.

Third step.

"You are leaning left," Cornelius said, hovering beside him. "Shift your weight right. Small adjustment."

Zeph corrected. The lean evened out.

Fourth step.

Fifth.

Halfway across.

The wind picked up. Not much. Just enough to make the plank creak.

Zeph froze. "Boss."

"You are fine. The plank is stable. Keep moving."

"The wind—"

"Is less than five knots. Insufficient to destabilize you. Keep moving."

Sixth step.

Seventh.

Almost there.

Zeph's foot reached the guild hall roof. He stepped off the plank and immediately sat down hard on the tiles. "Never again."

"Agreed." Cornelius landed beside him. "That was inefficient. We need a better method for the next crossing."

"The next—" Zeph stared at him. "There is another gap?"

"Three more, actually."

Zeph made a sound that was probably supposed to be words. It was not.

But he stood up.

Because they had thirty-five minutes until midnight.

And Kyriakos was still ahead of them.

The guild hall roof was peaked. Steep tiles that required actual climbing rather than walking. Cornelius went first again, his claws finding purchase on the terra-cotta.

Zeph followed. Slower. Using the same techniques he had used on the pipe. Hands and feet. Testing each grip.

They reached the peak.

From here, Cornelius's heat-sense could map half the city. The Festival below. The coastal path. The cliffs beyond.

And there.

A single warm thermal signature moving along Widow's Perch approach.

Kyriakos.

Still ahead.

But not by much.

"I see him," Cornelius said quietly.

Zeph pulled himself up beside him. "Where?"

Cornelius pointed. "The cliff path. He has maybe ten minutes head start now."

"Can we catch him?"

Cornelius traced the route in his mind. The customs house was still ahead. Then the cliff itself. The climb would be faster with Zeph than it had been alone. Zeph had reach. Human strength.

"Maybe," Cornelius said. "If we move quickly."

The descent down the guild hall's far side was easier than the climb up. Gravity helped. They half-slid down the tiles to the next roof edge.

The customs house waited across another gap.

This one was wider.

Ten feet at least.

No plank would bridge it.

"We jump," Cornelius said.

"No."

"We jump or we go back down to the crowd."

"There has to be another—" Zeph stopped. Looked at the gap. At the customs house roof. "Ten feet."

"Approximately."

"I can jump maybe eight feet. On flat ground. With a running start."

"Then you will need to jump farther tonight." Cornelius's tail lashed. "Or I carry you across."

"You said I was too heavy."

"For sustained flight. Not for a glide across ten feet of open air."

Zeph looked at him. At the gap. Back at him.

"You are serious."

"Completely." Cornelius moved to the roof edge. "You get a running start. I grab you at the edge. We glide together to the far roof."

"And if you cannot hold my weight?"

"Then we both fall and this entire evening becomes significantly more complicated."

Zeph laughed. It sounded slightly unhinged. "You know what? Fine. Let's do the insane thing."

He backed up. Gave himself maybe fifteen feet of roof space.

Cornelius positioned himself at the edge. Wings spread. Claws ready.

"On three," he said.

"Wait. Who counts?"

"I count. You run."

"Right. You count."

Cornelius watched Zeph's thermal signature. Watched his weight shift. His muscles tense.

"One."

Zeph started running.

"Two."

Faster. Building speed.

"Three."

Zeph hit the roof edge and jumped.

Cornelius launched at the same moment.

His claws caught Zeph's shoulders mid-flight. The weight was immediate. Terrible. His wings screamed in protest.

But they were gliding.

Falling, really.

But falling forward.

The customs house roof rushed up to meet them.

Five feet.

Three.

Cornelius's wings beat once. Hard. Changing their angle just enough.

They hit tile together. Rolled. Zeph's elbow cracked against terra-cotta. Cornelius's spectacles went flying.

But they were across.

They were across and nothing was broken.

Cornelius retrieved his spectacles. One lens had a new scratch. Unacceptable. But functional.

"That," Zeph said from where he was sprawled on the roof, "was the worst thing I have ever done."

"Worse than asking Sophia to the lantern ceremony?"

"So much worse."

"Then get up. We are not finished."

The customs house roof was the highest point in this section of the city. From here, Widow's Perch was visible as a dark mass against the star-filled sky.

And there.

A tiny pinpoint of light moving along the cliff face.

A lantern.

Kyriakos's lantern.

He was climbing. Already halfway to the summit.

"He is going to beat us," Zeph said quietly.

"Not necessarily." Cornelius's heat-sense swept the area below. Searching. Looking for—

There.

Two more thermal signatures. Moving along the coastal path.

Smaller than Kyriakos. One human-sized. One slightly cooler. Dryad-touched.

Sophia and Orestes.

They had made it out of the crowd. Were approaching the cliff from below.

The team was converging.

Three routes. Three approaches.

All aiming for the same summit.

Cornelius's breath weapon flickered at the back of his throat. Not deliberately. Just instinct. The predatory part of his brain recognizing a Hunt.

A real Hunt.

He opened his mouth.

And roared.

Not a large roar. Library Dragons did not have the lung capacity for truly impressive vocalizations.

But loud enough.

Sharp enough.

A sound that cut through the Festival noise and echoed off the cliff face.

Below, one of the approaching thermal signatures stopped. Looked up.

Sophia had heard.

She would know they were coming.

Would know the chase was still happening.

Cornelius looked at Zeph. "Can you climb the cliff?"

"In the dark? With no rope?"

"Yes."

Zeph stared at Widow's Perch. At the vertical limestone wall. At the impossible height.

Then he looked at Cornelius.

And smiled.

It was not a confident smile.

It was the smile of someone who had jumped a ten-foot gap and survived.

The smile of someone who was done being afraid.

"You know what?" Zeph said. "Yes. I can climb it."

"Good." Cornelius spread his wings. "Then we go now."

They descended the customs house the fast way. Straight down the drainage pipe. No careful climbing. Just controlled falling with periodic grabs to slow momentum.

They hit the ground running.

The cliff base was empty. Everyone was at the Festival. The coastal path showed recent foot traffic. Sophia and Orestes had passed through minutes ago.

Widow's Perch loomed above them.

Two hundred feet of vertical limestone.

Cornelius had climbed it once already tonight. His claws still ached from gripping cold stone. His wings still trembled slightly from the earlier flight.

He would climb it again.

Had to climb it again.

Because somewhere above, Kyriakos was approaching the Orchid with stolen knowledge and a prepared excavation plan.

And somewhere ahead, Sophia and Orestes were climbing the proper path. The safe path.

The slow path.

"Where do we start?" Zeph asked.

Cornelius's heat-sense mapped the cliff face. Found the same route he had used before. Ledges. Outcroppings. Cracks in the limestone.

"There." He pointed with one claw. "Follow exactly where I climb. Do not improvise. Do not try shortcuts."

"Got it."

Cornelius started up.

The stone was cold. Slick with spray. His claws found the first handhold and pulled.

Behind him, Zeph followed.

Twenty feet.

Cornelius's wings wanted to spread. Wanted to catch air and glide. But the wind was wrong. The angle was wrong. Spreading his wings here would just make him a sail for the gale to rip off the cliff face.

So he climbed.

Forty feet.

Zeph was still behind him. His breathing was controlled. Steady. The same rhythm he had used on the rooftops.

Sixty feet.

Halfway.

Cornelius's claws burned. His tail was cramping from constant counterbalance work.

Library work did not prepare a dragon for this.

Cataloging did not build the muscles needed to climb vertical cliffs in darkness while racing a perfumer to an extinct flower.

But he climbed anyway.

Eighty feet.

Above, the lantern light still moved. Kyriakos was nearing the summit. They were gaining. Not enough. But gaining.

One hundred feet.

Zeph's hand slipped.

Cornelius heard it. The scrape of palm against stone. The sharp intake of breath.

He looked down.

Zeph had caught himself. Three contact points still solid. But his hand was bleeding. Cornelius could see the thermal bloom of fresh blood against cold stone.

"Keep climbing," Cornelius said.

"I am fine."

"I did not ask if you were fine. I said keep climbing."

Zeph kept climbing.

One hundred twenty feet.

The alcove was close now. The same alcove where Orestes had been drugged. Where Sophia had waited. Where Cornelius had prepared to dive toward the pools.

One hundred forty feet.

Cornelius's claw found the alcove edge. He pulled himself up. Rolled onto flat stone.

Zeph appeared behind him. His hands were definitely bleeding. His breathing was labored.

But he was here.

They were here.

Both of them.

Cornelius moved to the alcove edge. His heat-sense swept the tide pools below.

No thermal signature by the pools.

Kyriakos was not there yet.

But the baked soil was visible even from this height. A circle of hardened earth where Cornelius's fire had fused the substrate.

The Orchid was still there.

Still protected.

Still alive.

For now.

Movement on the path below caught his attention. Two figures climbing. Moving faster now. No longer constrained by crowds or rooftops.

Sophia and Orestes.

Maybe five minutes behind Kyriakos.

Maybe seven minutes behind Cornelius and Zeph.

The team was converging on the summit.

All routes leading to the same tiny flower growing from a crack in submerged limestone.

Cornelius's breath weapon flickered ready.

His claws gripped stone.

"How much time?" Zeph asked between breaths.

Cornelius checked the moon's position. Did the mental calculation.

"Twenty minutes until midnight," he said. "Perhaps less."

"And Kyriakos?"

The lantern was directly above them now. Almost at the summit. Almost at the path that led down to the pools.

Almost at the Orchid.

"Close," Cornelius said.

Very close.

Too close.

"Then we go faster." Zeph was already moving toward the next section of cliff. The final vertical stretch to the summit.

The

 most dangerous part.

The part where one wrong grip meant a two-hundred-foot fall to the rocks below.

Cornelius spread his wings slightly. Not for flight. For balance.

"Stay close," he said. "We finish this together."

Together.

Not alone.

Not isolated.

Together.

They started climbing.

The summit waited above.

The Orchid waited below.

And somewhere between the two, a perfumer with stolen knowledge and alchemical tools prepared to commit botanical murder for profit.

Twenty minutes until midnight.

The race was almost over.

One way or another, it would end at the top.

---

# Chapter 17

# Chapter 17

They reached the final switchback thirty feet below the summit and Cornelius's entire body was screaming.

Not metaphorically.

His claws burned from gripping limestone. His wings ached from being held folded for so long. His tail had developed a tremor from constant counterbalance work.

He had climbed this cliff twice in one night.

That was twice too many.

Zeph collapsed against the cliff wall beside him, breathing hard. Blood from his torn palms smeared the stone. His thermal signature was spiking—exhaustion combined with adrenaline.

"Boss," he managed between breaths. "Please tell me we are almost there."

"Thirty feet." Cornelius's heat-sense mapped the path above. The summit was close. So close. "The path levels out after the next turn."

"Good. Because I cannot feel my hands."

Movement on the switchback below caught Cornelius's attention. Two figures climbing steadily upward.

Sophia and Orestes.

Finally.

They reached the landing a minute later. Sophia's face was flushed from exertion. Orestes moved like someone fighting invisible resistance—the chloroform still affecting his coordination even hours later.

"You made it," Sophia said. Not a question. Relief.

"Barely." Zeph held up his bleeding hands. "The rooftops were a terrible idea."

"The rooftops were efficient," Cornelius corrected. He turned to Orestes. "Where is Kyriakos?"

Orestes pointed up. "Summit. He reached it maybe five minutes ago. Now he is descending the tide pool path."

Five minutes.

They had closed the gap.

Not enough. But closer.

"How much time until midnight?" Sophia asked.

Cornelius checked the moon's position. Did the calculation. "Fourteen minutes. Perhaps fifteen."

"And how long until he reaches the Orchid?"

"Unknown. The descent is steep but navigable. With a lantern and prior reconnaissance—" Cornelius's tail curled. "Ten minutes. Maybe less."

The numbers assembled with terrible clarity.

They were out of time.

Even if they reached the summit immediately. Even if they descended at maximum speed.

Kyriakos would reach the Orchid first.

"We could shout," Zeph said. "Alert him. Make him know we are coming."

"No." Orestes's voice was sharp. "If you corner him, he will destroy the evidence."

Cornelius's scales prickled. "Explain."

"He brought the journal. Dr. Floros's research. If he believes capture is imminent, he will burn it. Throw it into the ocean. Remove any proof connecting him to the theft."

"The jar," Cornelius said. "We have the jar. Sophia can identify it as her work."

"You have glass fragments." Orestes leaned heavily against the cliff wall. His dryad-touched physiology was fighting the residual chloroform but losing. "Fragments prove someone had laboratory equipment. They do not prove Kyriakos used them to harvest an endangered species."

Sophia made a frustrated sound. "The journal is the only direct evidence. It has his fingerprints. His notes in the margins where he cross-referenced Dr. Floros's environmental data."

"Then we cannot let him destroy it," Zeph said.

"We cannot reach him before he reaches the Orchid," Cornelius countered. "The mathematics are clear. He has position. He has speed. We are exhausted and injured and—"

He stopped.

His mind had caught on something.

Something Orestes said.

*You have glass fragments.*

No.

They had more than fragments.

They had seen the complete jar back in Chapter 14 when Sophia described commissioning it. When she explained its purpose.

The specialized container.

Airtight.

Lead-reinforced.

With a one-way valve allowing gases to enter but never leave once sealed.

"The jar," Cornelius said slowly. "Is it still intact? Or did Kyriakos break it during the excavation?"

"Why does—" Sophia stopped. Her eyes widened. "You think he brought it with him."

"I think he designed an entire operation around that jar. Commissioned it specifically. Paid significant money for custom glasswork." Cornelius's tail was curling and uncurling rapidly now. The gesture he made when solving a particularly complex cataloging problem. "He would not leave it behind."

"But the Orchid has not bloomed yet," Zeph said. "So the jar is empty."

"Empty but present." Cornelius looked at Sophia. "You said the jar was unbreakable. That you designed it to withstand significant pressure."

"Borosilicate glass walls. Lead-reinforced rim." Sophia's voice shifted. Became the precise tone she used when discussing technical specifications. "It could survive a fall from this height. Multiple impacts. Even direct heat from an alchemical torch would not crack it."

"What about the seal?" Cornelius asked. "The mechanism that closes it?"

"It is a threaded cap. Like a bottle. But with an interior gasket that creates an airtight seal once pressure equalizes." Sophia's hands moved, sketching the invisible shape in the air. "The gasket is lead. Soft enough to deform and fill microscopic gaps. Hard enough to maintain structural integrity."

"Lead," Cornelius repeated.

And there it was.

The solution.

Assembling in his mind with the same perfect clarity as a properly organized card catalog.

Lead.

Soft metal.

Melting point: approximately 327 degrees.

Dragon fire temperature: sufficient for welding minor metal repairs in manuscript binding equipment.

Well above 327 degrees.

"We do not need to stop him from collecting the gas," Cornelius said quietly. "We need to seal it inside permanently."

Sophia stared at him. "What?"

"The jar is evidence. But only if it contains the Orchid's pheromones." Cornelius's claws gripped stone. His mind was racing now. Cataloging. Organizing. "If Kyriakos flees with an empty jar, we prove nothing. If he flees with a sealed jar containing a protected species' reproductive compounds, we prove intent. We prove harvest. We prove everything."

"But he will open it," Zeph said. "Later. In his workshop. He will extract the compounds and destroy the evidence."

"Not if the seal is permanent."

Silence on the switchback.

Then Sophia said, very carefully: "You want to weld it shut."

"I want to melt the lead gasket." Cornelius looked at her. "My fire is hot enough to liquefy lead but not so hot it would crack borosilicate glass. If I can apply heat directly to the seal while the jar is closed—"

"The lead melts," Sophia finished. Her voice was picking up speed. Energy. "Flows into the threads. Fuses the cap to the rim. Creates a permanent metallurgical bond."

"And traps the pheromones inside forever," Orestes said. Something like approval entered his voice. "A sealed confession."

"Exactly." Cornelius's tail lashed once. "Kyriakos designed that jar to be unbreakable. We turn that strength against him. Make it a prison for evidence he cannot destroy."

Zeph was nodding slowly. "Okay. Okay, that is actually brilliant. But there is one problem."

"What?"

"You weigh maybe twelve pounds. Kyriakos is a full-grown satyr. If he sees you coming, he will just—" Zeph made a kicking gesture. "You know. Remove you from the situation."

Valid concern.

Extremely valid.

Cornelius had not survived thirty-seven years as a Library Dragon by engaging in direct physical confrontation with beings five times his weight.

"Then we create an opening," he said. "A moment where Kyriakos is distracted. Focused elsewhere. Believes himself secure."

"How?" Sophia asked.

Cornelius looked at Zeph.

Zeph looked back.

"No," Zeph said.

"You are charismatic. Personable. Capable of engaging someone in conversation even under significant stress."

"Boss, I am not walking up to a guy who chloroformed a hermit and asking for his autograph."

"Not his autograph." Cornelius's mind was already sketching the approach. The timing. The exact sequence of actions required. "An explanation. A demonstration. You expressed interest in his perfume work back at the pavilion. Use that. Be the enthusiastic apprentice asking questions about technique."

"While you sneak up behind him and weld his evidence jar shut."

"Precisely."

"That is insane."

"That is our only option." Cornelius looked at the moon. At the inexorable movement toward midnight. "We have twelve minutes. Maybe thirteen. Kyriakos will reach the Orchid in eight. The bloom happens at midnight. Which means we have perhaps four minutes between his arrival and the moment the pheromones release."

"Four minutes to climb the rest of this cliff, descend the tide pool path, approach Kyriakos without alerting him, engage him in conversation, and weld a jar shut." Zeph laughed. It sounded slightly unhinged. "Sure. Easy."

"Not easy," Cornelius corrected. "Necessary."

Sophia touched Zeph's shoulder. "I will go with you. Two is more believable than one. We are both young. Both curious about his work. We can sell it."

"What about me?" Orestes asked.

"You guard the path." Cornelius looked at him. "If Kyriakos tries to flee back toward the summit, you stop him."

"How? I can barely merge with stone right now."

"Then improvise. Trip him. Make noise. Alert us." Cornelius's claws scraped against limestone. "But he will not flee upward. He will flee downward. Toward the ocean. Toward the route he scouted earlier."

"And when he runs?"

"We let him." Cornelius's tail curled with something approaching satisfaction. "Because he will be carrying a sealed jar full of protected genetic material. Evidence Captain Theo cannot dismiss. Cannot ignore. Cannot wave away as draconic melodrama."

The plan assembled.

Not elegant.

Not safe.

But possible.

Maybe.

"Positions," Cornelius said. "Zeph and Sophia approach from the path. Engaged. Visible. Non-threatening. I come from above. From the rocks. Kyriakos will be focused on the Orchid. On the bloom. His attention will be directed downward."

"And when the pheromones release?" Sophia asked.

"I seal the jar immediately. Before Kyriakos can process what is happening. Before he can stop me."

"Your fire is small," Orestes said. Not criticism. Observation. "Can you generate enough heat to melt lead in the time available?"

Cornelius thought about his breath weapon.

The tiny blue flame he used for mending torn manuscript pages.

For welding broken spectacle frames.

For fusing cracked pottery back into usable forms.

Small.

Precise.

Hot.

He had never tried to melt something as large as a jar seal before.

But he had melted lead before.

In controlled conditions.

Over careful preparation.

This would not be controlled.

This would be desperate.

But the alternative was watching Kyriakos walk away with a jar that would be opened in privacy and emptied in safety.

"Yes," Cornelius said. "I can do it."

He hoped that was true.

Zeph stood. Tested his bloody hands. "Okay. Then we go now."

"Wait." Sophia pulled something from her bag. A strip of cloth. "Let me wrap those."

She bound Zeph's palms quickly. Efficiently. The same competent movements she used when assembling glazed tiles.

Zeph flexed his fingers. "Better. Thanks."

"Do not die," Sophia said.

"That is the plan."

They started climbing.

The final thirty feet felt longer than the entire ascent combined.

Cornelius's claws found holds automatically now. Muscle memory replacing conscious thought. His heat-sense mapped the path above.

Twenty feet.

Fifteen.

The summit.

Flat stone. Wind-carved and ancient.

Beyond it, the tide pool path descended in switchbacks toward the ocean.

Cornelius crept to the edge. His heat-sense swept the area below.

There.

A warm thermal signature kneeling beside the largest tide pool.

Kyriakos.

His posture was focused. Intent. He was doing something with his hands. Preparing equipment. Positioning the jar.

The Orchid was directly below him.

Still protected by the circle of baked earth Cornelius had created hours ago.

But Kyriakos had tools.

A small trowel sat beside his knee. Sharp. Metal. Capable of chipping through hardened soil given enough time.

He was making progress.

Slow progress.

But progress.

"He is there," Cornelius said quietly. "Pools. Eastern edge. Kneeling."

Zeph moved beside him. Looked down. "I cannot see anything."

"Trust me."

"Always do." Zeph turned to Sophia. "Ready?"

"Ready."

They started down the tide pool path.

Walking.

Not running.

Not sneaking.

Just two young people navigating a steep trail in darkness.

Cornelius waited until they were twenty feet down the path.

Then he moved.

Not along the path.

Along the rocks.

The cliff face here was broken. Fragmented. Centuries of storms had created ledges and outcroppings that ran parallel to the official trail.

Harder to navigate.

Invisible from below.

Perfect.

Cornelius descended in silence.

His claws gripped stone worn smooth by salt spray.

His wings stayed folded.

His breath weapon flickered at the back of his throat. Ready. Prepared.

Below, Zeph's voice drifted up.

Loud.

Deliberately loud.

"—cannot believe we actually found you up here! Sophia said you were the Kyriakos Vlahos and I told her no way but—"

Cornelius could not hear Kyriakos's response.

But the thermal signature shifted.

Straightened.

Turned toward the approaching voices.

Good.

Distracted.

Cornelius dropped another ten feet.

He was almost level with the pools now.

Almost in position.

Sophia's voice joined Zeph's. "We saw your exhibition at the pavilion. The meridian collection? Absolutely stunning. The way you layered the citrus notes over the base—"

Flattery.

Intelligent flattery.

Appealing to Kyriakos's vanity while appearing harmless and starstruck.

It was working.

The thermal signature had turned fully away from the Orchid now.

Facing upslope.

Engaging with the interruption.

Cornelius reached the final outcropping.

Five feet above the largest tide pool.

Directly above where Kyriakos knelt.

He could see the jar now.

Clear borosilicate glass.

Maybe six inches tall.

Positioned directly beside the baked earth circle.

Open.

Waiting.

And there.

In the water.

The Orchid.

Tiny.

Pale.

Its petals were beginning to unfurl.

Midnight was close.

Very close.

Movement drew Cornelius's attention.

The Orchid's petals opened further.

One.

Two.

Three.

The bloom was happening.

Right now.

Cornelius's heat-sense detected a change in the air.

A warmth spreading from the flower.

Chemical compounds volatilizing.

Pheromones.

The scent of the Moon-Scented Orchid.

Kyriakos noticed.

His thermal signature shifted.

Attention snapping back to the pool.

His hand reached for the jar.

Lifted it.

Positioned it directly above the blooming flower.

The pheromones would rise.

Would enter through the one-way valve.

Would be trapped inside.

Unless—

Cornelius launched.

Not a glide.

A drop.

Straight down.

He landed on the jar's cap.

His weight—all twelve pounds of it—drove the lid downward.

The threads caught.

Sealed.

Kyriakos jerked back. "What—"

Cornelius's breath weapon ignited.

Blue flame.

Concentrated.

Precise.

Aimed directly at the seal.

The lead began to heat.

"Get off that!" Kyriakos's hand shot toward him.

Zeph tackled Kyriakos from the side.

Not gracefully.

Not skillfully.

But with enough surprise and momentum to knock the satyr off balance.

They hit the ground together.

Cornelius stayed on the jar.

Wings spread for balance.

Fire focused on the seal.

The lead was warming.

Starting to soften.

Just a few more seconds.

Kyriakos shoved Zeph off. "You little—"

Sophia appeared beside them. "Evidence tampering is a serious charge, Master Vlahos."

"This is not tampering. This is my equipment. My—"

"Your equipment containing pheromones from a protected species." Sophia's voice was sharp. "Witnessed by three people. Documented. Sealed."

The lead was melting.

Cornelius could feel it through his claws.

The gasket liquefying.

Flowing into the threads.

Fusing cap to rim.

"That dragon is destroying my property!"

"That dragon," came Orestes's voice from the path above, "is preserving evidence."

The dryad-touched hermit appeared at the edge of the pools.

Still moving slowly.

Still fighting chloroform.

But present.

Witnessing.

The lead solidified.

Fused.

Permanent.

Cornelius stepped off the jar.

Extinguished his breath weapon.

His entire body ached.

His fire-glands felt depleted.

But the jar was sealed.

Truly sealed.

Forever sealed.

Kyriakos stared at it.

At the jar he had commissioned.

The jar he had designed to be unbreakable.

Now a prison for his own crime.

"You," he said quietly, "have made a significant mistake."

"No," Cornelius said. His voice was level. Controlled. "You made the mistake. Eight months ago when you stole Sophia's glaze formula. Six weeks ago when you stole Dr. Floros's journal. Tonight when you attempted to harvest a protected species."

"Attempted?" Kyriakos's smile was cold. "I succeeded. The pheromones are in the jar. Mine. Legally obtained from public land during a natural bloom event."

"Legally obtained," Sophia repeated. "Using stolen research to locate an undisclosed endangered species site. With equipment specifically designed to prevent reproduction."

"Prove the research was stolen."

Orestes moved closer. "The journal. Show them the journal, Vlahos."

Kyriakos's thermal signature shifted.

Just slightly.

But enough.

"I do not know what you—"

"Your satchel." Orestes pointed. "Brown leather. The same satchel you carried three days ago when you surveyed these pools. The same satchel currently containing Dr. Anthea Floros's personal field journal."

Silence.

Then Kyriakos reached for the satchel.

Zeph was faster.

He grabbed it first.

Held it out of reach.

"Let me see."

Kyriakos's hand shot out.

Not toward Zeph.

Toward the journal visible at the satchel's opening.

Toward evidence.

Orestes moved.

Despite the chloroform.

Despite the exhaustion.

He was still the guardian.

Still the Watcher.

His hand caught Kyriakos's wrist.

"That," Orestes said quietly, "is not yours."

For a moment no one moved.

Then Kyriakos pulled back.

"Keep it," he said. "The journal. The jar. All of it. It proves nothing."

"It proves you stole protected biological material," Sophia said.

"It proves I collected gas from a flower. A flower growing on public land. During its natural bloom." Kyriakos adjusted his robes. Composed himself. "I have broken no law."

"You broke into Dr. Floros's room," Cornelius said.

"Prove it."

"You drugged Orestes."

"Prove it."

"You set a trap that could have killed Sophia or Zeph."

"Prove it." Kyriakos's smile returned. "You have theories. Accusations. And a sealed jar containing organic compounds from a plant that bloomed naturally tonight. Nothing more."

He was right.

Partially right.

The journal proved theft of research.

The jar proved collection of pheromones.

But neither definitively proved attempted extinction.

Unless—

"The Orchid is still here," Cornelius said slowly. "Still alive. And you have

 Dr. Floros's environmental data. Data you stole specifically to transplant the bulb and create a monopoly on future blooms."

Kyriakos went still.

"If we excavate the area around the pool," Cornelius continued, "we will find evidence of disturbance. Trowel marks in the baked earth. Recent digging. Attempts to access the root system."

"Speculation."

"Physical evidence." Cornelius looked at Orestes. "The hermit witnessed you measuring these pools three days ago. Documented your presence. Can provide testimony about your stated intentions."

"The rambling of a dryad-touched stranger who attacked me without provocation."

"A guardian performing his hereditary duty." Orestes's voice was firm. "Protecting endangered species from poachers."

The pieces were assembling.

Not a complete picture.

Not yet.

But enough to prevent Kyriakos from simply walking away.

"Captain Theo will want to examine that jar," Cornelius said. "And the journal. And this site. And when he does, he will find a pattern. Theft. Trespass. Assault. Attempted extinction for profit."

Kyriakos looked at each of them in turn.

At Zeph holding the satchel.

At Sophia standing witness.

At Orestes blocking the path.

At Cornelius perched on the stone beside the sealed jar.

"This is not over," he said quietly.

Then he turned.

And walked up the tide pool path.

Toward the summit.

Away from the Orchid.

No one stopped him.

They had what they needed.

Evidence.

Witnesses.

The Orchid itself, still blooming in the pool below.

Zeph exhaled. Long and shaky. "Did that just work?"

"Partially." Cornelius looked at the sealed jar. "We saved the Orchid. We secured evidence. We prevented monopolization."

"But Kyriakos is leaving," Sophia said.

"To where?" Orestes gestured at the cliff. "The summit connects only to Solterra Bay. Where Captain Theo waits. Where the Festival witnesses wait. Where his reputation and business interests are centered."

"He will run," Zeph said.

"Perhaps." Cornelius's tail curled. "But we have time now. Time to present evidence properly. Time to coordinate with authorities. Time to—"

A sound carried across the pools.

Voices.

Multiple voices.

Coming from the summit path.

Cornelius's heat-sense caught them.

Four thermal signatures.

Humans.

In Watch uniforms.

And at their head, one very familiar warm shape.

Captain Theo.

He appeared at the path's edge.

Lantern raised.

Expression neutral.

"Master Vlahos," Theo said. "Please remain where you are."

Kyriakos stopped.

Theo descended to the pools.

Three Watch officers followed.

He looked at the assembled group.

At Cornelius.

At the jar.

At the journal in Zeph's hands.

"Explain," he said.

And Cornelius did.

---

# Chapter 18

# Chapter 18

Captain Theo stood at the edge of the tide pools with his lantern raised and his expression absolutely neutral.

That expression was worse than anger.

Worse than skepticism.

Neutral meant Theo was cataloging. Observing. Building a case in his mind before committing to any position.

Cornelius recognized the technique.

He used it himself when evaluating damaged manuscripts.

"Explain," Theo said.

And Cornelius did.

He started with the journal theft from the Sea View Guest House six days ago. Moved through the pattern of botanical research requests. The borosilicate glass fragments. The perfume scent in Dr. Floros's room.

Theo listened without interrupting.

The three Watch officers spread out around the pools. Not threatening. Just present. Creating a perimeter that Kyriakos would have to cross if he wanted to leave.

Cornelius continued.

The tide pool measurements three days ago. Orestes's confrontation with a robed figure carrying brown leather and smelling of synthetic musk. The chloroform attack. The wire trap on the path.

He kept his voice level. Factual. The same tone he used when explaining library acquisition procedures to the City Council.

Facts, not patterns.

Evidence, not assumptions.

When Cornelius finished, Theo looked at Kyriakos.

"Master Vlahos. Your response?"

Kyriakos had composed himself during the recitation. His thermal signature was controlled now. Calm. He adjusted his robes with deliberate precision.

"I came to observe a rare botanical phenomenon," he said. "As is my right on public land. I brought equipment to collect atmospheric samples for professional research. When I arrived, I found these individuals trespassing and damaging my property."

He gestured at the sealed jar.

"That dragon welded my custom glassware shut. Destroyed months of preparation. Ruined a significant financial investment."

"The jar contains pheromones from a protected species," Sophia said.

"The jar contains gas from a flower," Kyriakos corrected. "A flower that bloomed naturally. That released compounds into the air naturally. I simply collected what was already dispersing."

"Using stolen research to locate an undisclosed population," Cornelius said.

"Prove the research was stolen."

Zeph held up the satchel. "The journal has Dr. Floros's name on every page. Her handwriting. Her personal notes."

"Which I found abandoned at the guest house," Kyriakos said smoothly. "I assumed it was discarded. Took it as reference material for my botanical studies."

Lie.

Complete lie.

But delivered with such confidence that doubt flickered across one officer's face.

Theo's expression remained neutral.

"The guest house clerk will confirm no such journal was in the public areas," Cornelius said. "And Dr. Floros will identify it as her personal property. Stolen from a locked room."

"A room she claims was locked." Kyriakos's smile was cold. "The good doctor has been experiencing memory difficulties. She admitted as much. Perhaps she simply misplaced her journal and forgot."

Cornelius's scales prickled.

That was dangerously close to what Dr. Floros herself had suggested yesterday. The fear in her voice when she wondered if the theft had been her own failing mind.

Kyriakos was using her vulnerability as a weapon.

"The journal is not the only evidence," Orestes said from his position on the path. "I witnessed you surveying these pools. Measuring. Planning. Three days before tonight's bloom."

"I witnessed a hermit attack me without provocation," Kyriakos countered. "Threaten me with violence. Force me to defend myself."

"You used chloroform."

"I used a defensive compound when a stranger emerged from the rocks making threats." Kyriakos's voice took on a wounded quality. "I feared for my safety. When he collapsed, I considered summoning the Watch. But given his evident mental instability, I chose to simply leave."

Another lie.

But again, delivered with conviction.

Theo's neutral expression had not changed.

He was still cataloging.

Still evaluating.

"The wire trap," Cornelius said. "Strung across the path at ankle height. Designed to cause serious injury or death."

"What wire trap?"

"The steel wire you positioned to prevent pursuit. We found it on the approach path."

"Then someone else placed it." Kyriakos spread his hands. "Perhaps the hermit, attempting to protect what he views as his territory. Perhaps vandals. The cliffs are public access. Anyone could have placed a wire."

He was good.

Better than Cornelius had anticipated.

Every accusation met with a plausible alternative explanation.

No direct admissions.

No confirmable details.

Just enough truth mixed with lies to create reasonable doubt.

Theo looked at Sophia. "You are the glasswork expert?"

"Yes, Captain. Sophia Doukas. House Doukas guild." She straightened slightly. "I commissioned and fabricated that jar to Master Vlahos's specifications eight months ago."

"For what stated purpose?"

"Capturing volatile aromatic compounds for perfume development." Sophia's voice was steady. "But the design he requested was excessive for standard atmospheric collection. The lead gasket. The reinforced rim. The one-way valve. Those features suggest he intended to trap something permanently. Something he never wanted released."

"Professional opinion," Kyriakos said. "Not evidence."

"The jar is sealed now," Theo observed. "Can it be opened?"

Cornelius shook his head. "The lead gasket is fused. Melted into the threads. Opening it would require destroying the jar completely."

"Which means the contents cannot be verified."

"The contents can be verified," Sophia said. "With proper analysis. Pheromone compounds are identifiable. Unique chemical signatures. A laboratory could confirm the gas inside matches the Moon-Scented Orchid."

"Could confirm," Kyriakos repeated. "Might confirm. Possibly confirm. But cannot confirm definitively without opening the jar. Which you admit is impossible without destruction." He looked at Theo. "Captain, I believe we have strayed from productive discussion into speculation."

Theo's jaw tightened slightly.

The first crack in his neutral facade.

"Master Vlahos, you will accompany me to the Watch station. For formal questioning."

"Am I being charged?"

"You are being questioned. As are these others." Theo gestured at Cornelius, Zeph, Sophia, and Orestes. "All of you will provide formal statements. Tonight."

"I am happy to cooperate," Kyriakos said. "Though I must note I am an invited Festival merchant. My reputation in this city is considerable. Any suggestion of impropriety could damage significant business relationships."

Translation: I have influence. Be careful how you proceed.

Theo's expression hardened further.

"Noted. Officer Dimitris, please escort Master Vlahos to the station. Separate interview room."

One of the Watch officers moved to Kyriakos's side.

Not touching.

Not restraining.

But present.

Kyriakos inclined his head slightly. "Of course, Captain. Though I believe you will find this entire incident was a misunderstanding. Resolved easily with clear communication."

He walked toward the path.

Stopped.

Turned back to look at the Orchid.

"Beautiful flower," he said quietly. "Truly extraordinary. Pity it blooms so rarely. One wonders how much longer the species can sustain itself with such limited reproductive opportunities."

Threat.

Barely veiled.

He was suggesting he might return.

Might finish what he started.

Might ensure the Orchid never bloomed again.

Cornelius's claws scraped stone.

But Kyriakos was already walking away. Following Officer Dimitris up the path toward the summit.

His thermal signature was calm.

Confident.

He believed he had won.

Believed his story would hold.

Believed wealth and reputation would insulate him from consequences.

Theo watched him go. Then turned to Cornelius.

"Your formal statement. Watch station. One hour."

"Understood."

"And Cornelius." Theo's voice dropped. "That jar is evidence now. You do not touch it. You do not move it. You do not investigate it further. Am I clear?"

"Perfectly clear."

"Good." Theo looked at the remaining officers. "Secure this site. No one approaches the pools until I return with proper documentation equipment."

He started up the path.

Stopped.

Looked back at the Orchid.

Its pale petals were fully open now. Tiny. Luminous. Releasing pheromones into the night air that only specialized equipment could capture.

Or specialized noses could detect.

Cornelius's heat-sense caught a new thermal signature.

Small.

Winged.

Approaching from the ocean.

A moth.

Large for its species. Maybe four inches across. Wings that reflected moonlight with an opalescent sheen.

The Moon-Moth.

The Orchid's pollinator.

It landed on the pool's edge. Antennae quivering. Following the pheromone trail to the flower.

Theo watched it for a long moment.

Then continued up the path without comment.

The remaining officers positioned themselves at intervals along the route. Creating a perimeter. Ensuring no one disturbed the site before official documentation.

Cornelius moved to the pool's edge.

The Moon-Moth had reached the Orchid. Its proboscis extended. Drinking nectar. Brushing against the flower's reproductive structures.

Pollinating.

Completing the cycle the Orchid had waited fifty years to attempt.

Ensuring another generation.

Perhaps.

If the seeds found proper habitat.

If conditions remained stable.

If no one disturbed the bulb during its dormant decades.

So many variables.

So much fragility.

Sophia sat down heavily on the stone beside him. "We did it."

"Partially."

"We saved the Orchid. We trapped the evidence. We stopped Kyriakos from monopolizing the species." She looked at him. "That is not partial. That is success."

"Kyriakos walks free."

"For now." Sophia's voice was firm. "But we have the journal. We have the jar. We have Orestes's testimony. And we have you."

"Me?"

"Your investigation. Your documentation. Your meticulous record-keeping." She smiled slightly. "The same obsessive organization that drives Zeph insane just became our strongest asset. Because you can reconstruct the entire timeline. Cross-reference every detail. Build a case that even Kyriakos's lawyers cannot dismantle."

Zeph appeared beside them. His wrapped hands were soaked through with blood. His clothes were torn. His face was exhausted.

But he was grinning.

"Did you see that moth?" he asked.

"I saw it."

"Biggest moth I have ever seen. Just. Flew right up to the weirdest flower in the ocean and started making moth-babies."

"That is not how pollination—" Cornelius stopped. "Yes. Essentially."

"We saved moth-babies."

"We saved potential genetic diversity for an endangered species."

"Same thing." Zeph sat down beside Sophia. "Boss, I just want to confirm something."

"What?"

"We are never climbing that cliff again. Right?"

"Correct."

"Good. Because I am fairly certain I left pieces of my hands on the limestone."

Sophia took his wrist gently. Examined the wrapped palms. "We need to get these properly cleaned."

"After the formal statement."

"Before the formal statement. You are not giving testimony while bleeding through bandages." She stood. "Come on. The Watch officers have medical supplies."

Zeph followed her.

Leaving Cornelius alone with Orestes.

The dryad-touched hermit settled onto a flat stone. His movements were still slow. Still impaired by the chloroform.

But improving.

"You did well, Lizard."

"Cornelius."

"Cornelius." Orestes's correction was almost respectful. "You honored your word. Protected the living truth. Even when it required getting your claws dirty."

Cornelius looked at his claws.

They were dirty.

Streaked with limestone dust. Salt residue. The grime that accumulated from climbing vertical surfaces and crawling through narrow spaces.

Unacceptable.

He would need to clean them thoroughly back at the library.

Organize his scales.

Polish his spectacles properly.

Restore order.

But that could wait.

"The Orchid is pollinated," Cornelius said.

"Yes."

"The jar is sealed."

"Yes."

"Kyriakos is contained."

"For now."

Cornelius's tail curled. "You believe he will return."

"I believe he is a gardener who sees beauty as property." Orestes looked at the Orchid. At the Moon-Moth still working among the petals. "Such men always return. They cannot help themselves."

"Then we will be ready."

"We?"

"You. Me. Zeph. Sophia." Cornelius's claws gripped stone. "Captain Theo. The Watch. The entire city if necessary."

Orestes was quiet for a long moment.

Then: "You have changed, Hoarder of Dead Words."

"My name is—"

"I know your name." Orestes's smile was faint. "But you have changed nonetheless. When you first climbed to my alcove, you sought a book. Now you protect a flower."

"I protect both."

"Yes. You do." Orestes stood. Moved to the pool's edge. "The Watcher acknowledges the Hoarder's guardianship. The living truth and the pressed truth shall share protection."

It sounded formal.

Almost ceremonial.

Cornelius was not certain how to respond to that.

"Thank you?" he tried.

"You are welcome, Cornelius Drake." Orestes pronounced the full name carefully. "Now go. Give your testimony. Build your case. Restore your city's order."

"What will you do?"

"Watch. As I have always done." Orestes looked at the Orchid. "And ensure this flower lives its full night. Dies its natural death. Returns to the stone until the next moon calls it forth."

Fifty years.

The Orchid would sleep for fifty years before blooming again.

Cornelius would be eighty-seven by then.

Ancient for a Library Dragon.

Perhaps too old to climb cliffs in darkness.

Perhaps too old to chase perfumers through Festival crowds.

But if he was alive.

If he was still cataloging.

Still organizing.

Still protecting.

He would return to this pool.

Would verify the Orchid's survival.

Would ensure no false gardeners had harvested its future.

"I will watch with you," Cornelius said.

"In fifty years?"

"In fifty years."

Orestes's smile widened slightly. "Then I shall save you a stone, Hoarder. One with a good view."

Cornelius left him there.

Climbed the path toward the summit.

His entire body ached.

His claws burned.

His wings trembled with exhaustion.

His fire-glands felt depleted. Empty. The reservoir that fueled his breath weapon reduced to the barest reserves.

But he had sealed the jar.

Had trapped the evidence.

Had saved the Orchid.

Had honored Dr. Floros's research.

Had proven Captain Theo wrong about draconic melodrama.

Had demonstrated that precise application of a small flame could achieve what brute force could not.

The Hunt was over.

The prey was contained.

Order had been restored.

Mostly.

The formal statements would take hours.

The investigation would take weeks.

The legal proceedings might take months.

But the center held.

The Orchid bloomed.

The evidence was secured.

The team had succeeded.

Together.

Not alone.

Together.

Cornelius reached the summit and looked back.

The tide pools were barely visible from this height. The Orchid was invisible. 

But Orestes's thermal signature was clear. Seated on his stone. Watching.

Keeping faith with a fifty-year cycle that had outlasted empires.

Sophia and Zeph were halfway up the path. Moving slowly. Supporting each other.

The Watch officers maintained their perimeter.

And somewhere ahead, Captain Theo waited with forms and questions and the bureaucratic machinery that would transform tonight's chaos into documented order.

Cornelius's scales settled.

His tail uncurled.

His breath weapon flickered once. Faint. Almost depleted.

But ready.

Always ready.

He spread his wings.

Not for flight.

Just to feel the air move across membrane and bone.

To remind himself he was a dragon.

Small.

Precise.

But still a dragon.

Hoarder of dead words.

Guardian of living truths.

Protector of both.

Then he folded his wings.

And walked toward the Watch station.

Toward forms and statements and proper procedure.

Toward order.

The moon watched from above.

Full.

Perfect.

Marking the exact moment when a flower bloomed.

When gas was trapped.

When evidence was sealed.

When chaos became glass.

Permanent.

Unbreakable.

Forever.

# Chapter 19

# Chapter 19

Captain Theo stood at the edge of the tide pools examining the sealed jar with an expression that might have been amusement.

Might have been.

Cornelius was too exhausted to read human microexpressions accurately.

"You welded it shut," Theo said.

"I fused the lead gasket using controlled heat application." Cornelius's claws gripped stone. "The seal is permanent. The contents are preserved. The evidence is intact."

"The evidence is trapped in a container that cannot be opened."

"Precisely."

Theo lifted the jar carefully. Turned it to catch the moonlight. The borosilicate glass was flawless. The pheromones inside were invisible. But the lead rim showed clear signs of melting—a silver band that had flowed and cooled into the threads.

"This is either brilliant," Theo said, "or completely insane."

"Both," Zeph offered from his position on the rocks. "Definitely both."

Theo set the jar down with exaggerated care. Then he looked at Kyriakos.

The perfumer had not moved since Officer Dimitris escorted him back to the pools. He stood with carefully composed neutrality. His expensive robes were dusty. His hands were empty. His thermal signature was controlled.

But his eyes tracked the jar.

"Master Vlahos," Theo said. "You are under arrest for theft of protected botanical research materials. Assault with chemical weapons. Attempted poaching of an endangered species. And—" He gestured at the wire trap one of the officers had retrieved from the path. "Attempted murder via mechanical trap."

Kyriakos's composure cracked. Just slightly. "Those are significant accusations, Captain."

"They are supported by significant evidence." Theo nodded at the jar. "Sealed biological material. A stolen journal with your fingerprints and marginal notes. Witness testimony from a hereditary guardian. And this." He held up the wire. "Steel cable strung at ankle height on a public path. Positioned to cause fatal injuries."

"I know nothing about that wire."

"Your climbing equipment includes rope and cable." Theo's voice was flat. Professional. "The same gauge as this trap. We will verify the match at the Watch station."

Kyriakos said nothing.

His thermal signature was rising now. Heat concentrating at his core. The satyr-kin equivalent of controlled panic.

"You have the right to legal counsel," Theo continued. "You have the right to remain silent during questioning. You do not have the right to leave Solterra Bay until this investigation concludes."

"I am a visiting merchant. An invited guest of the Festival Commission. My business interests—"

"Are now secondary to a criminal inquiry." Theo's expression remained neutral. But his voice carried weight. Authority. "Officer Dimitris will escort you to the Watch station. You will remain in custody until formal charges are filed."

Dimitris moved to Kyriakos's side. Not touching. Not restraining. But present.

Creating the perimeter that Kyriakos would have to cross.

And could not.

The perfumer looked at Cornelius. At the sealed jar. At the Orchid still blooming in its pool.

"This is not over," he said quietly.

"Yes," Cornelius said. "It is."

Kyriakos turned. Walked up the path with Dimitris following.

His thermal signature disappeared over the summit.

Gone.

Contained.

Removed from the equation.

Cornelius's scales settled.

The disorder that had permeated the past six days—the missing journal, the fractured investigation, the chaos of the climb—was resolving.

Not completely.

Not yet.

But the center was holding.

Theo crouched beside the jar. "I am going to need formal statements. From all of you. Details about the journal theft. The timeline. The evidence chain." He looked at Cornelius. "Can you provide that?"

"Yes."

"How detailed?"

"Extremely detailed. I have been maintaining investigative notes throughout. Cross-referenced by date, location, witness, and physical evidence."

Something that might have been respect flickered across Theo's face. "Of course you have."

"Proper documentation is essential for—"

"For building a case that holds up under legal scrutiny. I know." Theo stood. "Bring your notes to the Watch station. We will coordinate statements. Verify timelines. Ensure everything is recorded properly."

"Will the jar be sufficient evidence?"

"The jar. The journal. Orestes's testimony about the earlier survey. The wire trap. The chloroform residue." Theo's voice was grim. "Kyriakos designed this operation to be invisible. Untraceable. But he underestimated how much physical evidence an invisible crime leaves behind."

He gestured at the baked earth circle around the Orchid. "That hardened soil, for instance. You created that?"

"Yes. To prevent excavation."

"It also preserved the site. Locked the disturbance pattern in place." Theo knelt. His fingers traced the edge where Kyriakos's trowel had chipped away at the crust. "We can measure this. Document the tool marks. Prove he attempted to access the bulb."

Cornelius had not considered that.

His defensive action—baking the earth to shield the Orchid—had accidentally created a permanent record of Kyriakos's crimes.

Evidence from protection.

Order from chaos.

"I will document everything," Cornelius said.

"I know you will." Theo looked at the tide pools. At the Orchid. At the Moon-Moth still working among the petals. "What happens to the flower now?"

"It blooms tonight. The moth pollinates. The seeds develop over the next few weeks. Then the plant enters dormancy for fifty years."

"Fifty years," Theo repeated. "And if someone disturbs it during that time?"

"The cycle breaks. The species dies."

"Then we protect the site." Theo's voice was firm. "Official protection. Legal designation as an endangered habitat. No public access. No exceptions."

"Orestes will object to Watch presence on his cliffs."

"Orestes can object all he wants. This is now a documented ecological crime scene." Theo's smile was faint. "I suspect he will accept that. As long as we keep poachers away."

Movement on the path above drew Cornelius's attention.

Zeph was climbing carefully over the rocks near where Kyriakos had positioned his equipment. His wrapped hands made the navigation awkward. But he was reaching for something wedged into a crevice.

Brown leather.

Familiar dimensions.

The journal.

Zeph pulled it free. Examined it in the moonlight. Then he descended to the pools with exaggerated care.

"Found it," he announced. "Wedged between two rocks. Kyriakos must have stashed it there when he heard us coming."

He held the journal out to Theo.

Theo did not take it.

"Evidence chain," he said. "Where exactly did you find it?"

"Eastern rocks. Third tier up. Crevice about six inches deep." Zeph pointed with his elbow. "Right there. Between the flat stone and the one that looks like a broken tooth."

Theo nodded at Officer Keras. "Document that location. Photograph if possible. Then bag the journal as evidence."

Keras moved to comply.

But Zeph held the journal against his chest. "Wait. Can I—" He looked at Cornelius. "Boss, you should be the one to hold this. You are the one who figured out it was stolen. Who tracked it down. Who actually solved this entire thing."

Cornelius's tail curled.

That was not accurate.

He had made mistakes. Significant mistakes. He had wrongly accused Brother Demos. Had triggered Code Obsidian prematurely. Had nearly destroyed his credibility trying to force patterns onto incomplete evidence.

"I did not solve it alone," Cornelius said.

"But you started it. You kept going when everyone said to stop." Zeph's voice was quieter now. "You climbed cliffs. You crawled through vents. You organized all of us into something that actually worked."

"Zeph—"

"Take the journal, Boss. Just for a minute. Before it becomes official evidence and gets locked in the Watch vault." Zeph's wrapped hands extended the leather-bound volume. "Dr. Floros trusted you to find this. You should be the one to hold it when we tell her we got it back."

Cornelius looked at the journal.

At the pressed flower design on the cover.

At the careful stitching that held the binding together.

At the pages Dr. Floros had filled with fifty years of botanical observation.

Lost.

Now found.

He reached out carefully. His claws gripped the leather. The journal was heavier than expected. Dense with information. With research. With irreplaceable documentation.

The weight settled into his grasp.

Satisfying.

Correct.

Order restored.

"Thank you," Cornelius said quietly.

Zeph grinned. "You are welcome. Now let us get off this cliff before my hands fall completely off."

Sophia appeared beside them. She had been organizing the scattered equipment—the trowel, the rope, the fragments of borosilicate glass Kyriakos had not retrieved. Everything that could serve as evidence.

"I packed what I could," she said to Theo. "The glass fragments should match the jar's composition perfectly. I can provide documentation of the original commission if you need it."

"We will need it." Theo's voice was appreciative. "Your testimony about the design specifications will be crucial. The fact that you built something to Kyriakos's exact requirements creates a direct connection between him and the attempted harvest."

Sophia's expression tightened. "I built a tool. I did not know what he intended to do with it."

"You built evidence," Theo corrected. "Evidence that will help convict him."

"Good." Sophia's hands were still arranging the fragments. Organizing them by size. By thickness. The same meticulous attention she applied to tile-work. "Because he stole my mother's glaze formula. He exploited Dr. Floros's research. He nearly destroyed the last Orchid. Someone needs to stop him permanently."

"The law will stop him." Theo's voice was firm. "With proper evidence. Proper procedure. Proper consequences."

Sophia looked at the sealed jar. At the journal in Cornelius's claws. At the hardened earth preserving the Orchid.

"Then I am glad we gave you proper evidence."

They started up the path.

Cornelius moved slowly. His entire body protested the continued movement. His claws ached. His wings trembled with exhaustion. The reservoir that fueled his breath weapon felt depleted. Empty.

But he carried the journal.

That was sufficient motivation.

The climb to the summit took longer than the descent had. The path was steep. The limestone was slick with spray. The wind had not decreased.

But the moon was setting.

And on the eastern horizon, the sky was beginning to lighten.

Dawn.

The Festival's third night was ending.

The Twinkle Nights were concluding.

The beetles would disperse. The lanterns would come down. The city would return to its normal rhythms.

Order.

Familiar.

Predictable.

They reached the summit as the first pink light touched the clouds.

Orestes was there.

Still seated on his stone. Still watching the tide pools below. His thermal signature had stabilized. The chloroform was finally clearing his system completely.

He looked up as they approached.

His gaze settled on Cornelius. On the journal. On the sealed jar Theo carried.

"You kept faith, Hoarder."

"Cornelius," Cornelius corrected automatically.

"Cornelius Drake." Orestes stood. Moved to the cliff edge. "The Orchid blooms. The moth feeds. The cycle continues. The Watcher acknowledges your guardianship."

It sounded formal.

Almost ceremonial.

Cornelius was still not entirely certain how to respond to that.

But Orestes did not seem to expect a response.

He simply raised one hand. Palm out. A gesture that might have been farewell. Or acknowledgment. Or both.

Then he turned and moved toward the rocks.

His form blurred.

Merged with stone.

Disappeared into the cliff face as if he had never been separate from it.

Gone.

But present.

Always watching.

Cornelius felt something in his chest settle.

The wild had its guardian.

The library had its guardian.

Both protecting. Both watching. Both keeping faith with their respective charges.

Balance.

They continued down the coastal path.

The descent was easier than the climb. Gravity assisted rather than resisted. The switchbacks were familiar now. The handholds were mapped.

Zeph walked beside Sophia. Their shoulders touched occasionally. Not accidentally. Deliberately. The casual contact of two people who had decided proximity was comfortable.

Sophia was talking about glass.

"—could set up a small workshop. Nothing elaborate. Just a kiln and basic tools. The tile guilds already have the infrastructure. I could sublet kiln time until I establish proper credentials."

"You would stay?" Zeph's voice tried for casual. Failed completely. "In Solterra Bay?"

"The city needs someone who understands specialty glass. Scientific equipment. Custom alchemical pieces." Sophia's smile was visible even in the pre-dawn dimness. "And apparently, I am very good at building unbreakable evidence containers."

"You are very good at many things."

"I know."

Their hands found each other.

Cornelius looked away.

Not from discomfort.

From respect for privacy.

And perhaps from a small acknowledgment that some things did not require his observation or cataloging.

Some things simply were.

The path leveled out as they approached the lower cliffs. Harbor Square was visible below. The Festival pavilion was still standing. The lanterns were still strung. But the crowds had thinned. Most of the city was sleeping.

Recovering from three nights of celebration.

The beetles were dispersing now. Their bioluminescence was fading as natural light increased. They rose in scattered clouds. Drifting toward the marshes and meadows where they would spend the rest of their year.

Invisible.

Ordinary.

Until the next migration called them back.

Cycles within cycles.

Cornelius's claws gripped the journal more tightly.

Dr. Floros had documented fifty years of such cycles. Bloom patterns. Migration routes. Seasonal variations in coastal flora.

Knowledge that would have been lost if Kyriakos had destroyed the journal.

If Cornelius had given up after the Code Obsidian failure.

If Zeph and Sophia and Orestes had not assembled into something more effective than any individual effort.

They reached Harbor Square as the sun cleared the eastern horizon.

The square was empty except for cleaning crews. People were dismantling stalls. Sweeping. Restoring the space to its everyday configuration.

The Festival was ending.

Order was returning.

Captain Theo gestured toward the Watch station. "Statements. Now. While everything is fresh."

"How long will this take?" Zeph asked.

"Hours." Theo's voice was apologetic. "We need detailed accounts. Separate interviews. Cross-referencing. The process is thorough."

"But necessary," Cornelius added.

"Exactly." Theo looked at him. "You understand procedure. That will help."

They entered the Watch station through the main doors. The building was warm. Solid. Built from the same limestone as the cliffs but cut and fitted with precision.

Organized.

Secure.

Correct.

An officer directed them to separate interview rooms.

Cornelius was shown to a small space with a desk, two chairs, and a window overlooking the harbor.

He settled onto the chair carefully. The journal rested on the desk before him. The leather was scuffed from its time wedged between rocks. But the binding was intact. The pages were undamaged.

Preserved.

Protected.

Safe.

Theo entered with a notebook and a cup of mint tea.

He set the tea in front of Cornelius without comment.

Cornelius's tail curled with something approaching gratitude.

"Start at the beginning," Theo said. "The Festival. The missing library book. Everything that led to tonight."

And Cornelius did.

He recounted the inventory. The discovery of the missing volume. Dr. Floros's arrival. The pattern of botanical research requests. The borosilicate glass. The perfume scent.

Theo wrote steadily. His handwriting was precise. Organized. Each detail recorded in chronological order.

Like a catalog.

Like a proper investigation.

When Cornelius finished, Theo read through the notes. Made corrections. Clarified timelines.

Then he looked up.

"You were right," he said quietly.

Cornelius blinked. "About what specifically?"

"About this being serious. About books being important. About the investigation requiring immediate attention." Theo's expression was carefully neutral. "I dismissed you. Multiple times. I was wrong."

That acknowledgment settled into the space between them.

Significant.

Unexpected.

Valuable.

"You were operating on available evidence," Cornelius said carefully. "Which at the time was incomplete."

"You were operating on patterns and instinct. Which I do not trust." Theo's smile was faint. "But you were also maintaining meticulous records. Cross-referencing sources. Building a case even when I told you to stop."

"I am a librarian. Record-keeping is fundamental to my function."

"You are an investigator." Theo's voice was firm. "A good one. Even if your methods occasionally violate procedure."

Cornelius's scales prickled.

That was possibly the highest compliment Captain Theo had ever given him.

"Thank you."

"Do not let it go to your head." Theo stood. Collected the notebook. "I still expect you to coordinate with the Watch on future cases. No more Code Obsidian incidents. No more unauthorized searches of temple property."

"Understood."

"Good." Theo paused at the door. "The journal will be held as evidence until the trial concludes. But Dr. Floros can access it for research purposes under supervision. I will arrange that."

Relief.

Pure and immediate.

"She will appreciate that."

"I know." Theo's expression softened. Just slightly. "Now rest. You look terrible."

He left.

Cornelius remained in the interview room.

Drinking mint tea.

Watching the sun rise over Solterra Bay.

The city was waking. Fishing boats were launching. Market stalls were opening. The daily rhythms were resuming.

Normal.

Ordinary.

Perfect.

Footsteps in the corridor drew his attention.

Zeph appeared in the doorway. His hands were freshly bandaged. Properly bandaged. By someone who knew medical procedure.

"Sophia went home," he said. "Her guild wants a report about the jar. And she needs sleep before she opens negotiations about workshop space."

"She is staying, then."

"She is staying." Zeph's smile was exhausted but genuine. "She said Solterra Bay needs someone who can build things that trap criminals. I did not argue."

"Wise."

"I know." Zeph leaned against the doorframe. "Boss, can I ask you something?"

"Yes."

"Do you think we actually stopped him? Kyriakos? Or do you think he will find a way around this?"

Cornelius considered that.

The evidence was strong. The case was documented. Captain Theo was methodical and incorruptible.

But Kyriakos was wealthy. Connected. Skilled at manipulation.

The legal battle would be complex.

Long.

Uncertain.

"I think," Cornelius said carefully, "that we stopped him tonight. We saved the Orchid. We recovered the journal. We sealed the evidence. That is sufficient."

"Is it?"

"Yes." Cornelius's tail curled. "Because stopping him permanently is not our responsibility. That is Captain Theo's responsibility. Our responsibility was protecting the knowledge. The living truth and the pressed truth. We did that."

Zeph was quiet for a moment.

Then he nodded. "Okay. I can accept that."

"Good."

"Now can we go home? I am extremely tired and my hands hurt and I really want to sleep for approximately one thousand years."

"An exaggeration."

"Only slightly."

They left the Watch station together.

The sun was fully risen now. The streets were filling with people. The Festival decorations were coming down. The city was returning to itself.

Familiar.

Ordered.

Home.

The library appeared ahead. Solid limestone walls. Arched windows. The iron gate with its careful scrollwork.

Unchanged.

Waiting.

Cornelius's scales settled completely.

This was correct.

This was where he belonged.

Guardian of dead words.

Protector of pressed truths.

Keeper of order.

They entered through the side door. The interior was cool. Silent. Exactly as Cornelius had left it hours ago.

Before the climb.

Before the chase.

Before everything changed and then resolved back into perfect stillness.

Zeph collapsed onto the reading room sofa. "I am not moving from this spot until tomorrow."

"It is already tomorrow."

"Then the day after that."

Cornelius moved to his office. Set the journal on his desk with exaggerated care. It would stay there—under his watch—until Captain Theo formally transferred it to evidence storage.

Protected.

Guarded.

Safe.

His investigation ledger was still open. Still showing the entries from the past six days.

He picked up his pen.

Dipped it in ink.

And in his most precise script, he wrote:

*Case resolved. Evidence secured. Subject in custody. Order restored.*

*—C. Drake, Head Librarian, Solterra Bay Public Library*

*Fifth Day of Twinkle Nights Festival, Dawn*

He blotted the ink carefully.

Closed the ledger.

Set it in its proper position on the shelf.

Then he moved to the window.

The city spread below. Orderly. Predictable. His.

And on the distant cliffs, invisible but present, Orestes kept watch.

Balance.

Cornelius's wings folded.

His claws relaxed.

His breath weapon flickered once. Faint. Almost depleted.

But ready.

Always ready.

The Hunt was over.

The prey was contained.

The hoard was protected.

Order was restored.

Forever.

# Chapter 20

# Chapter 20

The library was quiet.

Properly quiet.

The Festival chaos had ended. The crowds had dispersed. The streets outside had returned to their normal rhythms—fishmongers calling prices, cart wheels grinding over cobblestones, the distant clang of the harbor bell marking the hour.

Eight bells.

Morning.

Cornelius sat at his desk in the office and allowed himself one moment of pure stillness.

His claws were clean. His scales were organized. His spectacles were polished to flawless clarity after he had replaced the scratched lens.

Order.

Complete.

Perfect.

The investigation ledger rested before him. Still open to the final entry from dawn. The ink had dried completely. The words were permanent now.

*Case resolved. Evidence secured. Subject in custody. Order restored.*

He should close it.

Should shelve it with the other completed ledgers.

Should move forward into the next catalog, the next inventory, the next perfectly ordinary day of managing his hoard.

But closing the ledger felt significant.

Final.

He was not entirely ready for that.

Footsteps in the corridor drew his attention.

Familiar gait. Measured pace. The faint rustling of robes.

Imelda.

She appeared in the doorway carrying a leather-bound journal and wearing an expression of carefully controlled approval.

"Cornelius."

"Imelda."

She entered the office and set the journal on his desk with exaggerated care. Right beside the investigation ledger.

Dr. Floros's field journal.

Retrieved from evidence storage under Imelda's authority as Head Librarian and delivered here for the formal return to its rightful owner.

"Dr. Floros will arrive within the hour," Imelda said. "Captain Theo has authorized temporary release of the journal for her use under library supervision. She may work here. In the reading room. With you as witness to proper handling."

"Understood."

"The trial will require the journal as evidence eventually. But until then—" Imelda's expression softened slightly. "Until then, Anthea deserves access to her life's work."

Cornelius's tail curled.

That was correct.

That was proper.

That was justice of the sort that mattered more than courtrooms and legal proceedings.

"I will ensure she has everything she requires," Cornelius said.

"I know you will." Imelda settled into the chair across from his desk. The same chair Dr. Floros had occupied six days ago when she arrived in a panic. "You did well, Cornelius. During the investigation. During the crisis. You protected knowledge. Both the pressed truth and the living truth."

"Orestes said the same thing."

"Then perhaps you should listen."

Cornelius's claws tapped the desk. "I made mistakes. Significant mistakes. I accused Brother Demos without proper evidence. I triggered Code Obsidian prematurely. I nearly destroyed my credibility with Captain Theo."

"You also saved an endangered species. Recovered stolen research. Prevented ecological catastrophe." Imelda's voice was firm. "Mistakes are part of learning, Cornelius. What matters is that you corrected them. You adapted. You built a team instead of working alone."

"Zeph corrected me. Repeatedly."

"Yes. He did." Imelda's smile was faint. "Which suggests you chose your intern well."

Movement in the main library caught Cornelius's attention.

Brother Demos had arrived.

The monk was on his hands and knees in the Botanical Texts section. Scrubbing. A bucket of soapy water sat beside him. His gray robes were rolled up to the elbows. His expression was carefully neutral but his thermal signature radiated embarrassment.

Penance.

Imelda had assigned him cleaning duty for the improper borrowing of *Secret Wonders*. Two weeks of maintenance work. Floors, shelves, windows. Everything supervised. Everything documented.

Restorative justice instead of formal punishment.

Brother Demos had accepted without argument.

"He is thorough," Imelda observed. "I will grant him that. The botanical section has never been cleaner."

"He should not have kept the book beyond the loan period."

"No. He should not have." Imelda's voice carried weight. "But he also cooperated fully during Captain Theo's investigation. Provided his temple movement records. Confirmed his alibi. Helped eliminate himself as a suspect so the real criminal could be identified."

Cornelius watched Brother Demos scrub a particularly stubborn spot on the limestone floor.

The monk's movements were meticulous. Careful. The same precision he applied to his research.

"He is a good scholar," Cornelius admitted quietly.

"Yes. He is." Imelda stood. "Which is why I am allowing him to continue using the library after his penance concludes. Under stricter loan policies. With mandatory renewals."

She moved toward the door.

Stopped.

Looked back at the investigation ledger.

"Close it, Cornelius. The case is finished. You solved it. Now let it rest."

She left.

Cornelius sat alone with the journal and the ledger and the quiet satisfaction of a hoard properly maintained.

The front door opened.

Voices in the entry hall.

One familiar. One less so but recognizable.

Zeph and Dr. Floros.

Cornelius collected the journal carefully. His claws gripped the leather binding. The weight was familiar now. Significant. He had held this volume at the tide pools. Had felt its presence as evidence of both crime and scholarship.

Now it was simply a book.

Returning to its rightful guardian.

He moved into the reading room.

Dr. Floros stood near the center table. She looked better than she had in days. Rested. Clear-eyed. Her clothes were neat. Her hair was properly pinned. Her hands were steady.

Recovering.

Reassembling.

She saw Cornelius. Saw the journal. Her expression shifted immediately.

Relief.

Pure and overwhelming.

"You found it," she said quietly.

"We found it." Cornelius crossed the room and held out the journal. "Hidden at the tide pools. Wedged between rocks where Kyriakos stashed it when he heard us approaching."

Dr. Floros took the journal with trembling hands. She opened it immediately. Her fingers traced the pages. Checking. Verifying. Confirming everything was intact.

"The maps are here. The bloom records. The environmental data." Her voice broke slightly. "Fifty years of work. I thought it was gone. Thought I had lost it. Thought my failing memory had—"

"Your memory did not fail you," Cornelius said firmly. "The journal was stolen. By a calculating criminal who exploited your research for profit. You were the victim. Not the cause."

She looked at him.

Her eyes were wet.

But she was smiling.

"Thank you, Cornelius. For believing me. For investigating when others dismissed it. For climbing cliffs and crawling through vents and organizing this entire impossible rescue."

Cornelius's scales prickled with something that might have been embarrassment.

Or pride.

Or both.

"I am a librarian," he said. "Protecting books is my primary function."

"You are more than that." Dr. Floros closed the journal carefully. Held it against her chest. "You are a guardian. Of knowledge. Of truth. Of the things that matter."

Zeph appeared beside them carrying a chair. "Dr. Floros, Imelda said you can work here as long as you need. I set up the corner table near the botanical section. Good light. Quiet. Close to the reference materials."

"Thank you, Zeph."

"You are welcome. Also—" He paused. Glanced at Cornelius. "Boss said something about late fees?"

Dr. Floros's expression shifted to concern. "I had the journal for six days past the original consultation period. The standard fees would be—"

"Waived," Cornelius said.

Both Zeph and Dr. Floros stared at him.

"The journal was stolen," Cornelius continued. "You cannot be penalized for circumstances outside your control. The fees are waived. The loan period is extended indefinitely under supervised access protocols."

Dr. Floros's smile widened. "You are certain?"

"Completely certain. Library policy section twelve, subsection four. Exemptions for theft, natural disaster, and acts of municipal chaos." Cornelius's tail curled. "The Twinkle Nights Festival qualifies as municipal chaos."

"Thank you." Dr. Floros moved toward the corner table Zeph had prepared. She settled into the chair. Opened the journal. Began reading immediately.

Home.

She was home.

Zeph and Cornelius returned to the office.

Zeph collapsed into the chair Imelda had vacated. His hands were still bandaged but the wrappings were cleaner now. Professional. Applied by someone who understood proper wound care.

Sophia, probably.

"She looks better," Zeph said.

"Yes."

"Think she will be okay? Long-term?"

Cornelius considered that. Dr. Floros's memory issues were real. Progressive. Potentially degenerative. But she had her journal back. Had her research. Had proof that her mind was not failing as catastrophically as she had feared.

"I think," Cornelius said carefully, "that she will adapt. Document more thoroughly. Create backup systems. Ask for help when she needs it."

"Good." Zeph's gaze drifted to the investigation ledger. "You going to close that?"

"Eventually."

"Boss, the case is solved. The bad guy is in jail. The flower is safe. The journal is returned." Zeph's voice was gentle. "What are you waiting for?"

Cornelius looked at the ledger.

At the careful entries documenting six days of investigation.

At the final line declaring order restored.

"Closing it makes it permanent," he said quietly. "Makes it history. Makes it—"

"Over?"

"Yes."

Zeph was quiet for a moment.

Then: "Is that bad?"

Was it?

The investigation had been chaos. Disorder. Climbing cliffs and crawling through vents and making mistakes that nearly destroyed his credibility.

But it had also been purpose.

Partnership.

Proof that his skills mattered beyond shelving books and cataloging acquisitions.

"No," Cornelius said finally. "It is not bad. It is simply... different."

"Different how?"

"I am accustomed to my role being predictable. Cataloging. Organizing. Maintaining." Cornelius's claws traced the ledger's edge. "The investigation required adaptation. Collaboration. Trust in others' expertise."

"You sound surprised that worked."

"I am surprised I allowed it to work."

Zeph grinned. "Character growth. Very impressive."

"Do not be insufferable."

"Too late. Way too late." Zeph stood. Stretched. His spine cracked audibly. "Sophia is meeting me for lunch at the harbor tavern. You should come."

"I have work."

"You always have work. Come anyway."

Cornelius looked at his desk.

At the inventory lists waiting to be updated.

At the acquisition requests requiring approval.

At the twenty-seven paperclips still sitting in their small container from two days ago when he had abandoned the sorting task to help Zeph.

Unfinished.

Imperfect.

Acceptable.

"What time?" Cornelius asked.

Zeph's grin widened. "Noon bells. We will save you a seat."

He left.

Cornelius remained in his office.

Alone.

But not isolated.

Not anymore.

He moved to the shelf behind his desk. The shelf that held his most valued items. His reference texts. His personal catalog. His collection of particularly fine bookbinding tools.

And now, one additional item.

The sealed jar.

Captain Theo had released it from evidence temporarily. For documentation purposes. For addition to the library's collection of unusual artifacts.

Cornelius lifted it carefully.

The borosilicate glass was cool against his claws. The weight was familiar. The melted lead gasket caught the light from the window.

Evidence.

Memory.

Proof that chaos could be transformed into something permanent and unbreakable.

He set the jar on the shelf.

Positioned it precisely between a first-edition botanical reference and a crystal paperweight Imelda had given him decades ago.

Perfect.

His hoard had grown.

Not with gold.

Not with gems.

But with something far more valuable.

Proof that knowledge could be protected.

That beauty could be preserved without being possessed.

That a small dragon with a precise flame could change outcomes.

His claws adjusted the jar one final time.

Satisfied, he returned to his desk.

The investigation ledger waited.

Open.

Incomplete.

He picked up his pen.

Dipped it in ink.

And beneath the final entry, he added one more line:

*Addendum: The Moon-Scented Orchid blooms in fifty years. Mark calendar for follow-up verification.*

*—C. Drake*

Then he closed the ledger.

The cover settled with a soft sound.

Final.

Complete.

Done.

He shelved it with the other investigation records. Positioned it precisely between the Spring Acquisition Audit and the Winter Damage Assessment.

Cataloged.

Organized.

Home.

Movement in the main library drew his attention.

Brother Demos had finished scrubbing the botanical section. He was wringing out his cloth in the bucket. His thermal signature had cooled. The embarrassment was fading into something approaching acceptance.

Penance completed.

For today, at least.

Cornelius moved into the main library. His claws clicked against limestone. His tail swished slightly. Satisfied.

Brother Demos looked up. Their gazes met.

Awkward.

Uncomfortable.

But necessary.

"The floor is clean," Cornelius observed.

"Yes, Head Librarian."

"Better than it has been in months."

"Thank you."

Cornelius hesitated. Then: "Your research request. The one regarding tidal medicinal properties. It is still valid. You may continue using the botanical section for that work. Under standard loan protocols."

Brother Demos's expression shifted. Surprise. Then gratitude.

"I appreciate that."

"You are a good scholar. The library benefits from good scholars." Cornelius's voice was firm. "Do not abuse that trust again."

"I will not."

"Good."

Cornelius returned to his office.

The morning continued.

Quiet.

Ordinary.

Perfect.

He updated his inventory lists. Approved three acquisition requests. Cataloged two donations that had arrived during the Festival chaos.

Normal work.

Familiar rhythms.

The sanctuary of paper and ink and stone.

Eleven bells chimed.

One hour until lunch.

Cornelius looked at his desk.

Everything was organized. Updated. Properly maintained.

Except for one small container.

Twenty-seven paperclips.

Mixed sizes. Unsorted.

He had been counting them two days ago. Had reached thirty-four sorted before Anthea Floros arrived and shattered his routine completely.

He could finish now.

Could sort the remaining clips by size and return them to their proper compartments.

Could restore that small corner of perfect order.

His claws reached for the container.

Stopped.

The paperclips could wait.

They were tools. Useful. But not urgent.

Not critical.

Not more important than lunch with Zeph and Sophia.

He left the clips unsorted.

Moved to the small mirror near his filing cabinet.

His scales were organized. His spectacles were clean. His posture was excellent.

Acceptable.

He collected his satchel. The one that held his notebook, his pencils, and a small emergency reference card in case anyone asked questions requiring citation.

Always prepared.

The library was quiet as he moved toward the exit.

Dr. Floros was still reading at her corner table. Completely absorbed. Her fingers traced the pages of her journal. Making notes. Cross-referencing. Rebuilding.

Brother Demos had moved to the temple history section. Reading. His penance bucket sat nearby. Ready for afternoon cleaning duties.

Imelda appeared from the archives. She saw Cornelius heading for the door and raised one eyebrow.

"Lunch?"

"With Zeph and Sophia."

"How civilized."

"It was suggested. Firmly."

"I am proud of you for accepting." Imelda's smile was genuine. "Enjoy yourself, Cornelius. You have earned it."

He left the library.

The streets were busy. Normal. The Festival decorations had come down completely. The city had returned to its everyday configuration.

Orderly.

Predictable.

Correct.

He walked toward the harbor tavern. Past the market stalls. Past the fountain where Zeph and Sophia had reconciled. Past the customs house where he had launched himself into darkness and wind.

The tavern appeared ahead.

Zeph was visible through the window. Seated at a corner table. Talking animatedly. His hands gesturing despite the bandages.

Sophia sat across from him. Laughing. Her head tilted slightly in the way that meant she was genuinely entertained.

They had saved him a seat.

Just as Zeph had promised.

Cornelius entered the tavern.

The interior was warm. Stone walls. Low ceiling. The sound of conversation and the faint clatter of dishes.

Zeph saw him immediately. Waved. "Boss! Over here!"

Cornelius navigated between tables. Climbed onto the chair they had positioned for him. His claws gripped the seat edge. His tail arranged itself carefully to avoid the neighboring table.

Acceptable.

Sophia smiled at him. "Cornelius. I am glad you came."

"Zeph was insistent."

"I was persuasive," Zeph corrected.

"Insufferable."

"Same thing."

A server appeared. Took orders. Departed.

The conversation continued.

Sophia was discussing her negotiations with the tile guilds. Workshop space. Equipment access. The possibility of establishing a specialty glass business focused on scientific instruments.

Zeph was asking questions. Intelligent questions about materials and techniques and business structures.

Listening.

Learning.

Growing.

Cornelius sat quietly. Observing. His notebook remained in his satchel. This moment did not require documentation.

This moment simply was.

The food arrived.

Fresh bread. Cheese. Olives. A small plate of grilled fish Sophia insisted Cornelius try.

He did.

It was acceptable.

Better than acceptable.

Good.

They ate. They talked. Zeph told an exaggerated version of the rooftop chase that made Sophia laugh until she had to set down her cup.

Cornelius corrected the details.

Zeph told him to stop being so accurate.

Normal.

Familiar.

This.

This was what the investigation had protected.

Not just the Orchid.

Not just the journal.

But this.

The ability to sit in a tavern with friends and eat lunch and argue about accuracy and laugh at exaggeration.

The freedom to choose chaos when necessary.

And return to order when possible.

Balance.

Eventually the meal ended.

Sophia had a meeting with the Doukas guild elders. Zeph needed to return to the library for afternoon shelving duties.

Cornelius needed to finish his inventory updates.

They left the tavern together.

Outside, Sophia touched Zeph's arm briefly. "I will see you tonight? For the lantern cleanup volunteers?"

"I will be there."

"Good."

She left.

Zeph and Cornelius walked back toward the library.

The afternoon sun was warm on the cobblestones. The harbor was busy. The city was alive.

Home.

They reached the library.

Entered through the main doors.

The interior was exactly as they had left it.

Cool. Quiet. Ordered.

Perfect.

Zeph moved toward the returns cart. "Back to work?"

"Back to work."

"Boss?"

"Yes?"

"Thanks. For coming to lunch. For—" Zeph hesitated. "For everything. The investigation. The cliff. The jar. All of it."

Cornelius's scales settled. "You are welcome."

"Also, you still have twenty-seven unsorted paperclips on your desk."

"I am aware."

"You going to finish that?"

Cornelius considered.

The paperclips were a symbol. Of his obsession with order. Of his need to control every detail. Of his fear that imperfection meant failure.

But they were also just paperclips.

Useful.

Not urgent.

Not critical.

"Eventually," Cornelius said.

Zeph grinned. "Character growth. Seriously impressive."

"Stop being insufferable."

"Never."

Cornelius returned to his office.

The afternoon light slanted through the window. The stone walls glowed honey-gold. The books on their shelves stood in perfect rows.

His hoard.

Complete.

Protected.

Safe.

He settled at his desk.

The closed investigation ledger sat on the shelf where it belonged. The jar rested beside his reference texts. The paperclips waited in their container.

Everything in its place.

He pulled his current inventory catalog toward him. Opened it to the marked page. Picked up his pen.

And returned to the work he loved.

Cataloging.

Organizing.

Preserving.

Protecting.

The Hunt was over.

The hoard was secure.

Order was restored.

And Cornelius Drake, Head Librarian of Solterra Bay, guardian of dead words and living truths, protector of knowledge in all its forms, was home.

Forever.
