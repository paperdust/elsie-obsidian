# Chapter 9

The library was silent.

Not the comfortable silence of after-hours solitude, when Cornelius could enjoy his tea and catalogs in peace. This was the heavy silence of three bells past midnight, when even the Festival crowds had retreated to their beds and the streets outside held only shadows.

Perfect.

Cornelius stood in his office, staring at the ventilation grate he had removed from the wall. The opening was approximately eighteen inches wide and twelve inches tall—dimensions he knew precisely because he had commissioned the ductwork himself forty years ago during the library's expansion.

Large enough for airflow.

Large enough, barely, for a determined Library Dragon.

He had shed his spectacles. They would only fog or catch on something in the tight spaces ahead. His investigation satchel remained on his desk—too bulky for the ducts. He carried nothing except his own scales, claws, and the burning certainty that Brother Demos's carrel held the evidence he needed.

The private study carrels occupied the library's eastern wing, accessible only to scholars who had applied for extended research privileges. Each carrel was a small private space—desk, chair, locked cabinet, shelf. The temple had secured Carrel Seven for Brother Demos three months ago, paying the standard fee for seasonal access.

Under normal circumstances, those carrels were inviolable. Scholars' privacy was protected by library policy and, in the case of temple monks, by religious law.

But these were not normal circumstances.

Cornelius had been barred from official channels. The head priest had refused his request. Captain Theo had explicitly ordered him to stay away from Brother Demos.

Which left unofficial channels.

The ventilation system.

Cornelius took a breath and climbed into the duct.

Immediately, he regretted it.

The space was cramped. His shoulders scraped the metal walls. His wings had to fold so tightly against his sides that the joints ached. The surface beneath his claws was slick with decades of accumulated dust and moisture residue.

This was undignified.

Also necessary.

He crawled forward, each movement producing soft scraping sounds that seemed impossibly loud in the enclosed space. His heat-sense painted the ductwork in shades of cool gray-blue—the metal had released the day's warmth hours ago. Ahead, the passage split into three directions. He took the center branch, following the route he had memorized from the building's original architectural plans.

The plans he had designed himself.

His library. His ducts. His investigation.

The metal creaked under his weight.

Cornelius froze.

The sound echoed through the ductwork, expanding and distorting until it sounded less like a small dragon in a ventilation shaft and more like the library itself groaning. He waited, counting heartbeats, listening for any sign that someone below had heard.

Nothing.

The library remained silent.

He continued forward, moving more carefully now. Slower. Each claw placed with deliberate precision to minimize noise.

This was harder than climbing Widow's Perch.

Different kind of danger. At the cliffs, the threat had been gravity and wind and the long fall to rocks below. Here, the threat was discovery. Humiliation. The complete destruction of what little credibility he had left after the Code Obsidian disaster.

If Captain Theo learned he had broken into the study carrels...

Cornelius pushed the thought away.

Facts, not patterns. Evidence, not assumptions.

And he would have evidence soon.

The duct angled downward. Cornelius braced his claws against the walls and let gravity pull him into a controlled slide. His scales scraped metal. Dust billowed around his snout, making his eyes water.

He emerged into a junction chamber—a larger space where multiple ducts converged around the library's central heating apparatus. The brass mechanism ticked softly, radiating gentle warmth that his heat-sense detected as a comfortable orange glow.

Four exits. He needed the southeastern branch. The one that fed air to the study carrel wing.

There.

Cornelius squeezed into the new passage. This duct was narrower than the last. His shoulders wedged against the walls. For a moment—one horrible, claustrophobic moment—he thought he might be stuck.

He twisted, scraping scales, and pushed through.

The passage opened slightly ahead. He could breathe again.

His joints protested. His wings ached from being compressed. His scales were coated in a layer of grime that would require a proper bath to remove.

But he was close now.

The duct ran parallel to the study carrel wing. Through the metal walls, Cornelius's heat-sense detected the faint thermal signatures of the rooms below. Most were cold—unoccupied. But one, three chambers ahead, held a warmer reading.

Not body-heat. Something else.

Recent use.

Carrel Seven.

Brother Demos's assigned space.

Cornelius crept forward until he reached the ventilation grate above the carrel. Through the metal slats, he could see the room below.

Small. Austere. A desk positioned beneath the grate. A single chair. A shelf holding perhaps two dozen volumes. A locked cabinet against the far wall.

And on the desk, barely visible in the ambient light filtering through the carrel's door, papers scattered in loose stacks.

Research materials.

Cornelius examined the grate. Standard installation. Four screws at the corners, designed for easy maintenance access. He had specified this design himself—vents that could be removed from inside the ducts for cleaning.

He extended one claw and carefully worked the first screw loose.

It turned smoothly. Silently.

The second screw proved more difficult. Forty years of salt air had corroded the threads. Cornelius applied pressure, felt the metal resist, then suddenly give way.

The screw dropped.

Cornelius's other claw shot out, catching it before it could fall through the grate and clatter onto the desk below.

His heart hammered against his ribs.

That had been close.

Too close.

He set the screw carefully in the duct beside him and continued working. Third screw. Fourth screw. The grate came free in his claws.

He set it aside and looked down into Brother Demos's carrel.

The drop was perhaps eight feet. Nothing dangerous for a dragon. But the landing would make noise. The desk was wooden—it would creak under his weight. The floor was tile—his claws would click.

He needed to be quieter than he had ever been.

Cornelius positioned himself at the opening, wings spread slightly for balance. He dropped.

His landing was nearly silent. A soft thump as his weight hit the desk. The wood creaked—barely audible. He froze, every sense alert for signs of discovery.

Nothing.

The library remained silent.

Cornelius exhaled slowly and looked around.

The carrel was exactly as he had glimpsed from above. Monk-sparse. Functional. The shelf held botanical texts—several he recognized from the library's own collection, checked out through legitimate channels. Others appeared to be personal volumes. Their spines were worn, well-used.

On the desk, papers covered nearly every surface. Handwritten notes in a cramped, precise script. Sketches of plant structures. Diagrams of coastal geography. Lists of tide schedules and lunar phases.

Research.

Obsessive, detailed research.

Cornelius's claws itched to organize it properly. The papers were not sorted by subject or date. No clear system. Just chaos masquerading as scholarship.

He forced himself to focus.

The journal. He was here for Dr. Floros's stolen journal.

Brown leather cover. Pressed flower design. Approximately eight inches by ten inches. Containing fifty years of botanical field notes and the map to the Moon-Scented Orchid.

Cornelius scanned the visible surfaces. Nothing matched that description.

He moved carefully around the desk, checking beneath papers. His heat-sense detected only the residual warmth of recent handling—someone had been working here earlier in the evening. The papers still held traces of body-heat from human fingers.

Not the desk, then.

The shelf?

Cornelius examined each volume systematically. Botanical Survey of the Southern Coast. Medicinal Properties of Rare Flora. Tide Pool Ecosystems and Their Inhabitants.

All legitimate texts. Nothing matching the stolen journal's description.

The locked cabinet.

Of course.

If Brother Demos had stolen the journal, he would not leave it visible. He would secure it. Hide it.

Cornelius approached the cabinet. Standard library issue. Simple lock. Designed to protect documents from casual interference, not from determined intrusion.

He extended one claw to the lock mechanism.

Then stopped.

Breaking the lock would leave evidence. Scratches. Damage. Proof that someone had been here. That would alert Demos. Potentially cause him to move the journal or destroy evidence.

No.

Cornelius needed to search without leaving traces.

He stepped back and reconsidered the space.

A small carrel. Limited hiding places. Desk—already searched. Shelf—already examined. Cabinet—locked and would show tampering.

Where else?

His gaze fell on the scattered papers again.

Hidden in plain sight.

The oldest trick in any monk's repertoire. Conceal the valuable thing among ordinary things. Make it disappear through obscurity rather than active hiding.

Cornelius returned to the desk and began examining the papers more carefully. Not reading content. Looking for physical characteristics. Texture. Weight. Age.

Most sheets were fresh vellum. Library standard. Available from the commons supply.

But beneath one stack, partially concealed by research notes about lunar cycles, his claw touched something different.

Leather.

Cornelius's breath caught.

He carefully moved the papers aside.

There.

A book.

Dark leather cover. Smaller than he had expected—perhaps seven inches by nine inches. The leather was worn, softened by age and handling. No visible title on the spine.

And pressed into the cover's center, faint but unmistakable even in the dim light, was a delicate flower design.

Cornelius's heart thundered.

This was it.

Dr. Floros's journal.

Hidden beneath Brother Demos's research. Exactly where a thief would keep stolen materials—close at hand for reference while maintaining plausible deniability if questioned.

Cornelius reached for it, then stopped.

He should verify. Open the cover. Confirm the contents matched Dr. Floros's description. Fifty years of field notes. Maps. Botanical observations.

His claw touched the leather.

The cover was cool. Smooth. The pressed flower design had been created by careful tooling—someone had carved the pattern directly into the leather surface, then treated it to preserve the impression.

Beautiful work.

The kind of craftsmanship that came from decades of practice.

Dr. Floros had mentioned her journal was a gift from a colleague. A master bookbinder who understood the needs of field researchers.

This matched.

Everything matched.

Cornelius wanted to open it. To see the maps. To confirm absolutely that this was the stolen journal.

But doubt whispered at the edge of his mind.

He had been wrong before.

Wrong about Brother Demos after the Code Obsidian incident. Wrong in his assumptions about patterns versus evidence.

What if this was not the journal?

What if it was simply another botanical text? A personal volume that happened to have a flower design and dark leather binding?

What if he was seeing patterns again instead of facts?

Cornelius's claw hovered over the book.

No.

This was different.

Brother Demos had been at the tide pools three days ago, wearing Kyriakos No. 5 perfume, carrying a brown leather satchel, measuring and documenting the exact location where the Moon-Scented Orchid would bloom. Orestes had witnessed it. Had described the monk's robes, the false-sweet scent, the violation of the sacred pools.

The perfume had also been present in Dr. Floros's room the morning of the theft.

The timeline matched. The evidence matched. The behavior matched.

This was the journal.

And finding it here, hidden among Demos's research papers, proved the monk was involved.

Either as the thief himself, or as an agent working for Kyriakos.

Vindication settled over Cornelius like a warm cloak.

He had been right.

His investigation had been correct from the beginning. Brother Demos was the key. The connection between the theft and the False Gardener's plan to harvest the Orchid.

But...

Cornelius stepped back from the desk, his analytical mind already moving ahead.

He could take the journal now. Remove it from Demos's carrel. Return it directly to Dr. Floros and be done with this entire mess.

Simple. Clean. Case solved.

But that would not restore his reputation.

Captain Theo would ask how he obtained the journal. Where he found it. What evidence connected it to Brother Demos.

And Cornelius would have to admit he had broken into the carrels illegally. Violated library policy. Ignored Theo's explicit orders.

The journal would be returned, yes. But Cornelius would face official reprimand. Possibly charges. Definitely humiliation.

No.

There was a better way.

Leave the journal here. In place. Exactly where he found it.

Tomorrow morning, during the library's public hours, Cornelius would arrange for a "discovery." Perhaps he could encourage Demos to bring research materials to the main desk for consultation. Or create a situation that required official library access to the carrel—inventory verification, maintenance inspection, something procedurally justifiable.

With proper witnesses present—Captain Theo, ideally, or at minimum other library patrons—the journal would be found in Demos's possession. The monk would be caught with stolen materials. Unable to deny. Unable to escape.

Public vindication.

Order restored through official channels.

Exactly as it should be.

Cornelius's tail swished with satisfaction.

He carefully repositioned the papers over the journal, recreating the exact arrangement he had found. Every sheet returned to its original placement. Every corner aligned precisely as it had been.

When he finished, the desk looked untouched. No evidence of intrusion. No sign that anyone had been here.

Perfect.

Cornelius turned his attention to escape.

The ventilation grate hung above him, eight feet up. Reachable by a jump, but awkward. He would need to climb—desk to chair to shelf to wall, using the shelving brackets as handholds.

He executed the climb in reverse of his entry. Shelf first. The bracket held his weight. He pulled himself up, wings spread for balance.

The grate beckoned.

One more push.

Cornelius sprang upward, caught the duct's edge with his front claws, and hauled himself into the ventilation shaft.

The grate needed to be replaced.

He maneuvered in the tight space, turning himself around. His wings protested. His shoulders ached. But he managed to position himself above the opening.

The grate went back into place. Four screws, turned carefully, silently, until they seated properly in their threads.

Done.

Carrel Seven looked exactly as it had before he arrived.

Undisturbed.

Innocent.

Containing the proof that would solve everything.

Cornelius crawled back through the ducts, retracing his path. The journey seemed easier now. Faster. His body remembered the route. His confidence overrode discomfort.

He had done it.

Infiltrated the carrel. Found the evidence. Left no trace.

Tomorrow, the journal would be recovered properly. Brother Demos would be exposed. Dr. Floros would have her research returned. The connection to Kyriakos would be investigated. The Orchid would be protected.

Order would be restored.

And Cornelius's reputation would be redeemed.

He emerged from the duct in his office, muscles trembling with exertion. Dust coated his scales. His joints protested every movement. He needed a bath. Tea. Sleep.

But first, he needed to document this.

Cornelius replaced the ventilation grate in his office wall, ensuring it looked undisturbed. Then he moved to his desk and opened his investigation ledger to the page labeled "Brother Demos."

His claw selected a fresh pen. Dipped in ink.

He wrote carefully:

*Evidence located. Dark leather journal with pressed flower design found concealed in Carrel Seven beneath research papers. Matches description of stolen materials. Location and concealment consistent with guilty knowledge. Recommend official recovery during public hours with witnesses present. Estimated timeline: tomorrow morning, nine bells.*

He dated the entry. Signed it with his official seal.

Then, after a moment's consideration, he turned back several pages to the entry he had made weeks ago. The one that had started this entire investigation.

*Secret Wonders: Field notes on medicinal herbs of the coastal regions.*

Status: MISPLACED.

He had written that to avoid embarrassment. To postpone the humiliation of admitting a book had been stolen from his library. Under his watch.

Now he understood.

Both books—*Secret Wonders* and Dr. Floros's journal—had been taken by the same person. Or persons. Brother Demos, working for Kyriakos. A conspiracy to gather botanical knowledge about rare coastal plants.

The Moon-Scented Orchid.

Everything connected.

Cornelius took a fresh pen and carefully drew a single line through "MISPLACED."

Above it, in his precise script, he wrote:

*STOLEN. Connection to Festival theft confirmed. See: Brother Demos investigation, current date.*

The word stood out on the page.

STOLEN.

Not lost. Not misplaced. Not misfiled.

Stolen.

And he had found it.

Well. Would find it. Tomorrow. Publicly. Properly.

Cornelius closed the ledger and set his pen aside.

His office felt warm. Safe. Familiar. His books surrounded him on every side—properly shelved, correctly catalogued, meticulously preserved.

His hoard.

His responsibility.

And tomorrow, he would prove that no one stole from his library without consequences.

No one violated order in Solterra Bay while Cornelius Drake stood watch.

He extinguished the lamp on his desk and moved to the small sleeping alcove behind the reference section. His scales still needed cleaning. His wings still ached. His joints would punish him in the morning for tonight's exertions.

But none of that mattered.

He had won.

The journal was found. The thief identified. The case—both cases—solved.

Tomorrow would bring vindication.

Order would be restored.

Cornelius curled into his sleeping cushion, tail wrapped around his body, and closed his eyes.

For the first time in days, he felt certain.

Absolutely, completely certain.

The Hunt was over.
