# Chapter 4

The fish market occupied the lowest tier of the harbor district, where the stone walkways met the sea. Cornelius had avoided this part of town for the better part of a decade. He was reminded, as he descended the final set of worn steps, why that had been an excellent decision.

The smell hit him first.

Not the clean, salt-bright scent of the open water. Not even the ordinary fish-and-brine smell of a working harbor. This was something far more visceral. Fresh-caught mackerel and yesterday's unsold stock. Seaweed baking on stone. The metallic tang of fish blood running in rivulets between the paving tiles.

Cornelius's nostrils flared once, cataloging the offense, then he shut his mouth firmly and resolved to breathe as little as possible.

The market sprawled across a wide plaza overlooking the docks. Wooden stalls formed uneven rows, their awnings patched and salt-stained. Merchants shouted prices. Gulls screamed overhead, diving for scraps. A group of children chased each other between the stalls, their feet slapping through puddles of dubious origin.

Chaos. Complete and utter chaos.

Cornelius's tail lashed once in irritation. He had left Dr. Floros and Zeph at a small tavern two streets back, with instructions to wait while he pursued this final line of inquiry. Zeph had been visibly relieved. The boy had been checking his reflection in every shop window they passed, attempting to smooth his hair into something other than "windblown disaster."

Hopeless. But at least it kept him occupied.

Cornelius adjusted his spectacles and scanned the market. Nephele's stall would be near the water, where the fishing boats unloaded their catch. He picked his way carefully between the vendors, stepping over coiled ropes and avoiding the larger puddles.

A woman selling clams eyed him as he passed. "Looking for something, little drake?"

"Information," Cornelius said crisply. "I am seeking Nephele."

The woman jerked her thumb toward the far end of the plaza. "Last stall on the left. She's packing up for the day."

Cornelius inclined his head in thanks and continued on.

The crowd thickened near the water's edge. Fishermen hauled baskets of the day's catch onto the stone pier. A man in rubber boots gutted a massive tuna with practiced efficiency, tossing the innards into a bucket already swarming with flies. Cornelius gave the bucket a wide berth and tried not to think about how long those flies might live if they found their way into his library.

Another problem for another day. Preferably never.

He spotted Nephele's stall ahead. It was larger than the others, with a proper tile counter and three separate display trays filled with ice and fish. A wooden sign hung overhead: *Nephele's Catch – Fresh Daily*.

Nephele herself stood behind the counter, sluicing water over the tiles with a bucket. She had changed from the simple clerk's tunic she had worn at the guest house. Now she wore a heavy canvas apron over rough trousers, both liberally stained with fish scales and what Cornelius sincerely hoped was only water.

She looked up as he approached. Recognition flickered across her face, followed by wary resignation.

"Master Drake," she said. "Didn't expect to see you down here."

"I do not make a habit of visiting the docks," Cornelius agreed. He hopped onto a relatively clean section of the counter and settled into a sitting position, tail wrapped neatly around his haunches. "However, I have additional questions regarding the theft at the guest house."

Nephele set down her bucket and wiped her hands on her apron. It did not improve their cleanliness. "I already told you everything I know."

"You told me what you observed during your shift at the guest house," Cornelius corrected. "However, I have since learned that you were in the vicinity of Room Seven yesterday evening. I require clarification."

Her expression shifted—just slightly. A tightening around the eyes. Not quite guilt. More like the look of someone who had been caught doing something they would prefer to keep private.

"I wasn't *in* the room," she said carefully.

"But you were nearby."

A pause. Then she sighed and leaned against the counter. "Yeah. I was in the alley. Making a delivery."

"What sort of delivery?"

"Oysters." She gestured toward a smaller ice tray at the edge of her stall, where a dozen oysters sat in perfect rows. "Special order. Some rich fool staying at the Seacliff wanted the freshest catch before the Festival. Said he'd pay double if I delivered them to his villa personally."

Cornelius's ear-frills pricked forward. "The Seacliff Villa?"

"Yeah. The fancy place on the hill. Takes twenty minutes to walk there, and the whole time I'm carrying a basket of oysters on ice." She shook her head. "But he paid in advance, so I went."

"What time was this?"

"Around seven bells. Just before sunset. I'd already closed the stall for the day."

Seven bells. Dr. Floros had been at breakfast at eight bells. Which meant Nephele had been near the guest house approximately one hour before the theft.

Cornelius made a mental note and continued his questioning. "Did you enter the guest house?"

"No. I cut through the service alley to save time. It's a shortcut to the hill road."

"Did you see anyone else in the alley?"

Nephele frowned, thinking. "There was someone. A man in a hood. Didn't get a good look at his face. He was near the guest house wall, kind of lurking by the crates. I thought maybe he worked there—you know, taking a break or something. Didn't think much of it."

Cornelius went very still. A hooded man. Near the guest house. At precisely the right time for someone planning a theft.

Brother Demos.

It had to be. Temple scholars wore hooded robes. And Demos had already proven willing to flee when spotted. Of course he would skulk in alleys, preparing his crime.

The pattern solidified further. Nephele had inadvertently witnessed the thief casing his target.

"Did this man speak to you?" Cornelius asked.

"Nope. He just kind of... moved back into the shadows when I passed. Like he didn't want to be seen." She shrugged. "Figured he was meeting someone he shouldn't. You know how it is during Festival. People get stupid."

"Indeed." Cornelius's mind was already cataloging the new information. Brother Demos, hooded and furtive, positioned near Room Seven's window one hour before the theft. Waiting for Dr. Floros to leave. Planning his approach.

It all fit.

"This delivery," Cornelius said, returning to the earlier thread. "Who placed the order?"

"Some perfumer. Kyriakos something. Vlahos, I think." Nephele wrinkled her nose. "Fancy type. Wore enough cologne to choke a horse. Paid with actual gold, though, so I wasn't about to complain."

Cornelius's ear-frills flattened slightly. Kyriakos Vlahos. The name was familiar. The perfumer who made Kyriakos No. 5—the scent detected at the crime scene.

A small, uncomfortable prickle of unease crept down his spine.

But no. That was simply coincidence. Kyriakos Vlahos was a celebrity perfumer. Of course his scent would be prevalent during Festival season. Wealthy patrons wore it. Merchants sold it. The entire upper district probably reeked of it by now.

The fact that Nephele had encountered him shortly before the theft meant nothing.

Cornelius pushed the thought aside and focused on what mattered: Nephele herself.

She was a large woman. Not fat, but solid. The kind of build that came from hauling fish baskets and scrubbing market stalls. Her hands were rough and capable, her arms corded with muscle. She moved with the heavy certainty of someone who knew exactly how much space she occupied and did not particularly care if it inconvenienced others.

In short, she was the exact opposite of stealthy.

The thief who had entered Room Seven had opened a window, navigated a cluttered desk, removed a specific journal without disturbing the surrounding papers, and departed without leaving footprints in the alley below. That required precision. Delicacy. Light feet and steady hands.

Nephele gutted tuna for a living. She slammed buckets onto stone counters. She smelled, quite frankly, like the inside of a fishing boat.

There was no possible way she could have executed the theft at the guest house.

"Did you return to the guest house after making your delivery?" Cornelius asked.

"Nope. Went straight home. I live above Cassius's bakery, three streets over from the harbor. Got in around nine bells, had dinner, went to bed." She crossed her arms. "Ask Cassius if you don't believe me. He was closing up when I came in. We talked for a bit."

An alibi. Solid and easily verified.

Cornelius felt a small satisfaction settle into place. Nephele was not the thief. She had been in the wrong place at an inconvenient time, but she had not stolen Dr. Floros's journal.

Which left Brother Demos.

"One final question," Cornelius said. "This perfumer—Kyriakos Vlahos. What was he doing at the Seacliff Villa?"

Nephele shrugged. "How should I know? Probably staying there for the Festival. Rich people do that. Rent the fancy villas, throw parties, show off their money." She picked up her bucket again. "He seemed pleased with the oysters, though. Gave me a tip on top of the payment. Said they were 'exquisitely fresh.'"

She said it in a mocking, high-pitched tone that suggested what she thought of people who used words like "exquisitely" for shellfish.

Cornelius found himself in rare agreement with her assessment.

"Thank you for your cooperation," he said, hopping down from the counter. "If you recall anything else about the hooded man in the alley, send word to the library."

"Sure thing." Nephele returned to her cleaning, already dismissing him.

Cornelius picked his way back through the market, mind churning.

Nephele: eliminated. Too large, too loud, too obvious. And she had an alibi.

Brother Demos: still the primary suspect. Hooded figure seen at the scene. Proven interest in rare plants. Observed fleeing with a brown leather book.

Kyriakos Vlahos: irrelevant. A wealthy perfumer with expensive tastes and poor timing. His presence near the guest house was simply the result of Nephele's delivery route.

The synthetic musk scent at the crime scene was still an anomaly. But perhaps Dr. Floros had encountered Kyriakos at some point. A chance meeting in the market. A conversation near the guest house. The perfume was distinctive enough to linger.

Yes. That made sense.

Cornelius emerged from the fish market and paused at the top of the harbor steps, allowing himself a moment to breathe clean air. The plaza above was crowded with Festival preparations. Merchants strung lanterns between the buildings. A group of musicians practiced on a makeshift stage. Children ran past carrying paper beetles on sticks.

The chaos of Festival had provided perfect cover for a thief. But it had also provided witnesses. And witnesses, however inadvertent, created patterns.

Nephele had seen a hooded man.

Dr. Floros had been approached by Brother Demos.

Cornelius himself had observed Demos fleeing with a leather book.

Three separate points of data, all converging on the same conclusion.

Brother Demos was the thief.

Cornelius felt his scales settle into a more comfortable arrangement. The case was nearly closed. All that remained was to confront the monk, recover the stolen journals, and restore order.

He turned and began the walk back toward the tavern where he had left Dr. Floros and Zeph.

The streets were fuller now as the town prepared for the evening's festivities. Vendors sold roasted nuts from wooden carts. A woman demonstrated beetle-shaped kites to a crowd of delighted children. Someone had placed small oil lamps in the shop windows, their flames casting warm light onto the cobblestones.

Cornelius ignored it all. His mind was already planning the next steps.

First, return to Dr. Floros. Inform her that Nephele was not a viable suspect.

Second, proceed to the temple. Request an audience with the head priest.

Third, present the evidence against Brother Demos and demand access to his quarters.

Fourth, recover the journals and return them to their rightful owners.

Simple. Logical. Efficient.

Exactly how an investigation should proceed.

He reached the tavern—a modest establishment called The Copper Kettle—and slipped through the half-open door. The interior was dim and smelled of bread and olive oil. Dr. Floros sat at a corner table, nursing a cup of tea. Zeph lounged in the chair beside her, attempting to make his windblown hair lie flat through sheer force of will.

Dr. Floros looked up as Cornelius approached. "Did you find anything?"

"I found confirmation," Cornelius said, hopping onto the table. "Nephele was near the guest house yesterday evening, but she has a solid alibi and lacks the physical capability to execute the theft. However, she observed a hooded figure lurking near Room Seven at approximately seven bells. I believe this was Brother Demos, surveilling his target."

Dr. Floros's hand tightened around her teacup. "Then we have him."

"We have evidence," Cornelius corrected. "Which we will present to the temple authorities. Properly. Through official channels."

Zeph snorted. "Since when do you care about official channels?"

"Since I require access to a monk's private quarters," Cornelius said. "Temple law grants certain protections. We cannot simply search Brother Demos's rooms without the head priest's consent. Therefore, we will request it. Politely. With evidence."

He said it with the same tone one might use to explain basic arithmetic to a particularly slow student.

Zeph rolled his eyes but did not argue.

Dr. Floros drained the last of her tea and stood. "Then let us go to the temple."

Cornelius hesitated.

The sky outside had begun to dim. Not full dark yet, but approaching the threshold when the Festival lights would be lit and the town would transform into a maze of lanterns and shadows. The temple was a ten-minute walk from here, through increasingly crowded streets.

Confronting Brother Demos in the chaos of Festival evening, with witnesses and distractions everywhere, was inefficient.

Better to wait until morning. When the temple would be quiet. When the head priest would be available for proper discussion. When Cornelius could approach the situation with the full weight of daylight and clear-headed logic.

"No," he said. "We wait until morning."

Dr. Floros stared at him. "But—the Orchid—"

"Will still be blooming in three days," Cornelius said firmly. "We have time. And I prefer to conduct investigations when I can see clearly and think without distraction. Brother Demos is not going anywhere. The temple is his sanctuary. He believes himself safe there."

He let his tail curl in satisfaction. "Which means we have the advantage."

Dr. Floros looked like she wanted to argue. But after a moment, her shoulders sagged. "You are right. I am simply... anxious."

"Understandable," Cornelius said, more gently. "But anxiety leads to mistakes. We will proceed methodically. I will meet you at the library at eight bells tomorrow morning. We will go to the temple together, present our evidence, and recover your journal. I promise you."

She nodded, though she did not look entirely convinced.

Zeph stood and stretched. "So I can still make the Festival tonight?"

"Yes, yes. Go impress your tile artist." Cornelius waved a dismissive wing. "But be at the library by eight bells tomorrow. On time. Not 'Zeph time.'"

The boy grinned and was out the door before Cornelius could issue further instructions.

Dr. Floros gathered her cloak. "I suppose I should return to the guest house. Try to sleep, though I doubt I will manage it."

"I recommend chamomile tea and a good book," Cornelius said. "It has never failed me."

She smiled faintly. "I will try. Thank you, Master Drake. For taking this seriously. For helping me."

"Books are serious business," Cornelius said. "Stolen books even more so."

He watched her leave, then sat alone at the table for a moment, organizing his thoughts.

The case was clear. The evidence pointed to Brother Demos. The pattern was unmistakable.

And yet.

That small, uncomfortable prickle of unease had not entirely faded.

Kyriakos Vlahos. Celebrity perfumer. Present near the guest house at the right time. Wealthy enough to purchase rare botanical specimens. Connected to the scent found at the crime scene.

But also: a public figure. Someone who would be recognized. Someone who would leave obvious traces.

The thief who stole Dr. Floros's journal had been careful. Deliberate. They had opened the window from inside, suggesting prior access. They had removed the journal without disturbing the surrounding chaos. They had left only broken glass and a lingering scent.

Would a celebrity perfumer risk such a theft personally?

Unlikely.

Would Brother Demos, a reclusive scholar with proven interest in rare plants and a history of requesting botanical texts?

Far more plausible.

Cornelius's scales settled. The unease faded.

He was overthinking. A common flaw in intellectuals. The simplest explanation was usually correct. Brother Demos was the thief. The hooded figure Nephele had seen confirmed it.

Tomorrow, he would prove it.

Cornelius hopped down from the table and made his way toward the door. The evening air greeted him, cool and tinged with the sweet smell of roasting chestnuts from a nearby cart. The first Festival lanterns were being lit, their warm glow reflecting off the tile roofs.

He turned toward the library. His sanctuary. His hoard.

Where everything was in order. Where every book knew its place. Where the world made sense according to clear, logical rules.

Tomorrow, he would restore that same order to Dr. Floros's life.

Tonight, he would review his notes. Prepare his arguments for the temple authorities. Perhaps enjoy a cup of mint tea and a chapter of the new natural philosophy text from Khariton.

The Hunt was progressing exactly as it should.

Cornelius felt a deep, satisfied certainty settle into his bones as he walked through the lamplit streets toward home.

He had his thief.

All that remained was proving it.
