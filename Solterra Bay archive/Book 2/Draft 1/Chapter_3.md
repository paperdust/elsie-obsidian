# Chapter 3

The Sea View Guest House stood three stories tall, its whitewashed walls pressing close to its neighbors on either side. Cornelius adjusted his spectacles and surveyed the building with a critical eye. Blue shutters flanked each window—some open, some closed, all faded to varying degrees by proximity to the harbor. A wrought-iron balcony jutted from the second floor, draped with drying linens that flapped in the breeze like territorial flags.

Not a dignified establishment, then. But not a hovel either.

He turned to Dr. Floros, who had stopped at the base of the front steps. Her hands were knotted together, knuckles pale.

"Which room?" he asked.

"Second floor. Third door on the left." Her voice had steadied somewhat during the walk from the library, but her breathing remained shallow. "Room Seven."

"Wait here." Cornelius shifted the weight of his investigation satchel and started up the steps. Behind him, he heard Zeph mutter something that might have been a complaint about stairs.

The front door opened into a narrow entry hall papered in faded geometric patterns that had once, perhaps, been fashionable. A woman stood behind a small desk wedged into the corner, scribbling in a ledger. She looked up as Cornelius entered.

"Help you?" she asked. Then her gaze dropped to floor level, found him, and her expression shifted to mild surprise. "Oh. Didn't see you there."

Cornelius was accustomed to this. Humans had a tendency to look for threats at their own eye level, which meant a cat-sized dragon was often overlooked until he spoke.

"I am Cornelius Drake, Head Librarian of Solterra Bay," he said, drawing himself up to his full height on the doormat. "I am investigating a theft from Room Seven. I require access."

The woman—Nephele, according to the small wooden nameplate on her desk—set down her pen. She had the weathered hands of someone who worked outdoors and the tired eyes of someone who worked two jobs. Cornelius recognized her from the fish market. She sold mackerel in the mornings and apparently managed guest house administration in the afternoons.

"Dr. Floros already reported it to the Watch," Nephele said. "Captain Theo told her to wait until tomorrow."

"Captain Theo," Cornelius said with careful precision, "is a bureaucrat with all the investigative instincts of a very slow brick. I, however, am not. Now. The key, if you please."

Nephele's mouth twitched. She reached into a drawer and produced a brass key. "Second floor. But if you break anything, I'm charging the library."

"I do not break things," Cornelius said. "I am a professional."

He took the key in his talons and glided up the staircase, Zeph's heavier footsteps thudding behind him. Dr. Floros brought up the rear, moving with the reluctance of someone returning to the scene of a disaster.

The second-floor corridor was narrow and dim. Four doors lined each side, their painted numbers worn to ghosts. Cornelius landed in front of Room Seven and inserted the key with a satisfying click.

The door swung open.

Cornelius's first thought was that Dr. Floros had undersold the state of the room. His second thought was that she had clearly never learned the most basic principles of field organization.

Papers covered every surface. The writing desk was buried beneath loose sketches, rock samples, and what appeared to be three different field guides left open to various pages. The bed frame supported a teetering stack of botanical references. A canvas satchel had vomited its contents across the floor—specimen jars, pencils, a magnifying glass with a cracked lens, and several cloth bundles that smelled faintly of dried roots.

"Good grief," Cornelius muttered.

"I was working," Dr. Floros said defensively from the doorway. "I needed everything accessible."

"Accessible and organized are not mutually exclusive concepts." Cornelius stepped carefully over a scatter of pressed flowers and made his way to the writing desk. "This is chaos."

"This is research."

"This is a fire hazard waiting for a convenient spark." He turned in a slow circle, cataloging the room. The bed, the desk, the wardrobe, the washstand. One window overlooking the street. One window—

There.

The second window stood open, curtains drifting inward on the evening breeze. Cornelius crossed to it and examined the latch. It was simple iron, well-made but showing signs of age. He tested it with one claw. The mechanism moved smoothly. No scratches. No sign of forced entry.

"You are certain this was latched when you left for breakfast?" he asked.

"Yes." Dr. Floros had not moved from the doorway. "I always check the windows before I leave. Force of habit from sleeping in field camps."

Cornelius leaned out and looked down. The window opened onto a narrow service alley barely three meters wide. The walls on either side were rough limestone, offering ample handholds for anyone with climbing experience or sufficient motivation. A stack of crates sat against the opposite wall, forming a makeshift ladder to the first-floor level. From there, a reasonably fit human could scale to the second floor without much difficulty.

He pulled back inside and turned his attention to the desk.

The papers scattered across its surface were covered in Dr. Floros's cramped handwriting—observations, measurements, botanical sketches. But in the center of the desk, a clean rectangle stood out against the dust.

Cornelius went very still.

The outline was perhaps twenty centimeters tall and fifteen wide. Exactly the dimensions Dr. Floros had described for her journal. The dust around it showed gentle scuff marks where the book had been slid forward and lifted.

Not grabbed in haste. Moved carefully.

Deliberately.

"Zephyr," Cornelius said. "Bring me the magnifying lens from my satchel."

The boy had been hovering near the door, trying to look useful while simultaneously glancing back toward the stairwell every few seconds. He retrieved the lens and handed it over.

Cornelius examined the clean rectangle closely, then the area immediately surrounding it. The desk's surface was cluttered but not filthy. Dr. Floros clearly cleaned with some regularity. Which meant the dust pattern was recent—within the past few days.

And there, at the edge of the outline, something glinted.

He adjusted the lens and leaned closer.

Crushed glass. Tiny fragments, nearly invisible against the wood. They caught the light at sharp angles, prismatic and wrong.

"Curious," he muttered.

"What is it?" Dr. Floros took a hesitant step into the room.

"Glass fragments. Very small. Freshly broken, I would estimate." Cornelius touched one shard with the tip of his claw. It was thin. Precise. Not the heavy greenish glass of common bottles or jars. This was something finer.

"Zeph," he said. "What kind of glass is this?"

The boy crouched down beside him, squinting at the fragments. "Uh. Looks like... borosilicate?"

Cornelius's ear-frills pricked forward. "You are certain?"

"Yeah. My cousin works at the alchemist's shop on Harbor Street. They use borosilicate for all their lab stuff. It's thinner than regular glass. Doesn't crack from temperature changes." Zeph picked up one of the larger fragments and held it to the light. "See how clear it is? No bubbles. That's expensive."

Borosilicate glass. Used in alchemical laboratories and by scholars who required precision instruments. Not the sort of thing one found lying about in a guest house.

Which meant the thief had brought it. Or broken it during the theft.

But why would someone stealing a leather journal be carrying laboratory glass?

Cornelius filed the question away and continued his examination. The dust outline, the glass, the open window. All pointed to a swift, targeted theft. The thief had known exactly what they wanted and where to find it.

He turned his attention to the rest of the desk. Papers. Rocks. Three different field guides—one on coastal flora, one on limestone geology, one on medicinal compounds. A jar of drawing ink. A ceramic cup holding five pencils of varying lengths.

And beneath it all, faint but unmistakable, a scent.

Cornelius went still, nostrils flaring.

Synthetic musk. The same scent he had detected on Dr. Floros earlier. But here it was stronger. Concentrated. It clung to the desk surface, the papers, the very air around the spot where the journal had rested.

He breathed it in carefully, analyzing. Sharp. Chemical. Expensive. The sort of fragrance wealthy patrons wore to make themselves memorable. And beneath the musk, something else—a floral note. Jasmine, perhaps. Or orchid.

Memory clicked into place.

This was not generic perfume. This was a specific blend. He had smelled it before, years ago, when a traveling merchant had tried to sell him a collection of rare texts wrapped in scented silk. The merchant had reeked of the stuff, and Cornelius had spent the next day airing out the library.

The merchant had called it "Kyriakos No. 5."

A perfumer's signature scent. Made by the House of Vlahos, sold to collectors and the fashionably wealthy. Cornelius had dismissed it at the time as an overpriced novelty for humans with more money than sense.

But here it was again. On Dr. Floros. On her desk. Strong enough to linger hours after the theft.

"Zeph," he said slowly. "Do you smell anything unusual?"

The boy sniffed. "Yeah. Smells like... I dunno. Perfume?"

"What kind of perfume?"

Zeph sniffed again, more carefully this time. His expression shifted to something like recognition. "Oh. That's Kyriakos. No. 5, I think. Sophia's mom has a bottle. She wears it on special occasions."

"Kyriakos No. 5," Cornelius repeated.

"Yeah. It's kind of expensive. Like, really expensive." Zeph stood and brushed off his knees. "Why would someone wearing that be stealing books?"

An excellent question.

Cornelius turned it over in his mind. Brother Demos was a temple scholar. Temple scholars took vows of modest living. They wore simple gray robes and ate communal meals and devoted themselves to study. They did not, as a general rule, wear expensive perfume.

Unless Brother Demos was not what he appeared to be.

Or unless the thief was not Brother Demos at all.

The thought arrived with the cold clarity of a bibliographic error spotted in a rare manuscript. Certain. Undeniable. Accompanied by a faint sensation of anxiety.

Cornelius pushed it aside.

No. He had seen Brother Demos fleeing with a brown leather book. Dr. Floros had confirmed the monk's interest in her work. The patron logs showed Demos researching rare coastal plants. The pattern was clear. The evidence was solid.

The perfume was simply... an anomaly. Perhaps Demos had purchased it as part of his scheme. To disguise himself. To appear wealthier than he was when negotiating with potential buyers for the stolen journal.

Yes. That made sense.

It had to make sense, because the alternative—that he had misidentified the thief and sent them chasing the wrong suspect—was unacceptable.

"Boss?" Zeph was looking at him with concern. "You okay?"

"I am fine." Cornelius shook himself and returned to the desk. "The perfume is simply evidence of poor taste. Many thieves have delusions of sophistication."

He made a notation in his small notebook: *Kyriakos No. 5 detected at scene. Borosilicate glass fragments. Open window, unforced latch.*

Then he turned to examine the rest of the room. The wardrobe held Dr. Floros's traveling clothes—practical tunics, sturdy trousers, a heavy cloak. The washstand held soap, a comb, and a small mirror. Nothing unusual. Nothing out of place beyond the general chaos of her working method.

He glided to the open window and looked out again.

The service alley was empty now. But across the gap, on the neighboring building's terrace, someone moved.

Cornelius's eyes narrowed.

A young woman sat on a low stool, a sketchbook balanced on her knees. She wore a simple linen dress the color of terra-cotta, and her dark hair was pinned back with what appeared to be ceramic clasps shaped like beetles. Her hand moved in quick, precise strokes across the page.

She was not looking at the alley. She was looking up, toward the terrace above, where strings of unlit Festival lanterns hung waiting for nightfall.

Calculating. Measuring angles with the end of her pencil.

An artist.

"Oh no," Zeph breathed.

Cornelius glanced back at his assistant. The boy had gone rigid, eyes fixed on the woman across the alley. His hand had moved unconsciously to his hair, attempting to smooth down the mess the wind had made of it. His other hand plucked at the front of his tunic—the one he had worn to help carry Dr. Floros's things, which now bore a suspicious fish-scale pattern along one sleeve.

"Zephyr," Cornelius said. "Focus."

"That's Sophia," Zeph whispered.

"I assumed as much, given your sudden paralysis."

"She's right there. I look like—" He gestured helplessly at himself. "I smell like mackerel."

"You smell like a human who has been working. It is not a moral failing."

"I was supposed to meet her at the Festival. Looking nice. Not like... this." Zeph's voice had taken on a plaintive edge.

Cornelius felt his tail lash once in irritation. "Zephyr. We are conducting an investigation. Your romantic prospects are not the priority."

But the boy was not listening. He had moved to the window, leaning out slightly, attempting to catch Sophia's attention without actually calling out to her. It was a masterclass in human inefficiency.

Cornelius considered his options. He could drag Zeph bodily away from the window. He could deliver a lecture on professional conduct during field investigations. He could assign him to stand guard in the hallway until his brain resumed normal function.

Or he could complete the investigation himself and deal with the distracted assistant later.

The third option was most efficient.

"Stay here," Cornelius said. "Do not touch anything. Do not fall out the window. I am going to speak with Dr. Floros."

Zeph made a vague sound of acknowledgment, still staring at Sophia.

Cornelius glided back to the doorway, where Dr. Floros waited with Nephele. The guest house clerk had apparently come upstairs to ensure they were not, in fact, destroying the room.

"Well?" Dr. Floros asked. "Did you find anything?"

"I found evidence consistent with a planned theft," Cornelius said. "The window was unlatched from inside, suggesting the thief had prior access to your room. The journal was removed carefully, not grabbed in haste. And there are fragments of borosilicate glass on the desk, which suggests your thief uses laboratory equipment."

Dr. Floros pressed a hand to her mouth. "Then it was someone with alchemical knowledge. Someone who understood the value of the compounds in my notes."

"Possibly." Cornelius did not mention the perfume. It was a detail. Possibly irrelevant. Possibly a distraction from the clear pattern that pointed directly to Brother Demos.

He turned to Nephele. "Have you seen Brother Demos in this building?"

The clerk frowned. "The monk from the temple?"

"Yes."

"Can't say I have. He keeps to the archives, doesn't he? I've seen him in the market once or twice, but never here."

"Have you seen anyone else enter Room Seven? Anyone who seemed out of place?"

Nephele shook her head. "I work mornings at the fish stall. I'm only here afternoons. You'd have to ask Petros—he does the night shift."

Another dead end. Cornelius's tail twitched in annoyance.

"Very well," he said. "Thank you for your cooperation."

He returned to the room to collect Zeph, who was still gazing longingly at Sophia's terrace. The artist had finished her sketch and was now packing her supplies into a leather satchel. She moved with the efficient grace of someone who had done this a thousand times.

"Zephyr," Cornelius said firmly. "We are leaving."

"But—"

"Now."

The boy tore his gaze away from the window and followed Cornelius into the hallway. His expression was tragic.

"I look like a fish merchant," he muttered.

"You *are* assisting a fish merchant's investigation into your employment," Cornelius said. "You should be proud of your practical attire."

"That's not how dating works, Boss."

"Then I am grateful to be a dragon."

They descended the stairs and exited the guest house. Dr. Floros was waiting on the front steps, wringing her hands.

"So?" she asked. "What now?"

Cornelius adjusted his spectacles and considered the evidence.

One: Brother Demos had shown specific interest in rare coastal plants and bloom schedules.

Two: The timeline of his library requests aligned with the disappearance of *Secret Wonders*.

Three: He had been observed fleeing with a brown leather book matching the description of Dr. Floros's journal.

Four: The theft showed planning and inside knowledge.

Five: Borosilicate glass and expensive perfume at the crime scene.

Points one through four formed a clear pattern. Point five was... anomalous. But not impossible. Thieves were often messy. They made mistakes. They wore perfume they could not afford and broke equipment they should not have been carrying.

The simplest explanation was that Brother Demos had gotten sloppy.

Cornelius was a scholar. He believed in evidence. He believed in patterns. And the pattern here pointed to the temple.

"Now," he said, "we go to the temple. We find Brother Demos. And we recover your journal."

Dr. Floros nodded, relief flooding her features.

Zeph sighed and cast one last look back at the guest house.

And Cornelius, satisfied that he had correctly identified his culprit, led them toward the temple district.

The Hunt continued.
