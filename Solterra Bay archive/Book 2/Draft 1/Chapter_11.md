# Chapter 11

Seventeen.

Cornelius dropped the paperclip into the left-hand compartment of his desk organizer and selected another from the unsorted pile.

Eighteen.

This one had a slight bend in the upper curve. Manufacturing defect. He set it aside in the designated rejection pile and chose the next.

Nineteen.

The library was silent.

Not the comfortable silence of after-hours solitude. This was the thick, oppressive silence of a tomb. Or a failure.

Twenty.

The paperclip gleamed in his claws—brass-plated steel, standard library issue, precisely 1.25 inches in length when measured along the outer wire. He had measured them all three years ago when the new shipment arrived. Recorded the specifications in his supply ledger.

Order. System. Control.

The things he was supposed to be good at.

Twenty-one.

Through his office doorway, the main stacks stretched in perfect rows. Every book properly shelved. Every spine aligned. The catalog system he had maintained for forty-three years without error.

Except he had made errors.

So many errors.

Twenty-two.

Cornelius's claws trembled slightly as he placed the paperclip in its compartment. He forced his talons steady and selected another.

Twenty-three.

The ventilation grate in his wall mocked him. He had removed it two nights ago. Crawled through those ducts like some common sneak-thief. Violated library policy. Broken into Brother Demos's carrel.

And for what?

Twenty-four.

A book that was not the stolen journal. A pattern that was not actually a pattern. A certainty that had been nothing but arrogance.

Twenty-five.

The door to the library's entrance hall creaked.

Cornelius did not look up. Likely Zeph, returning from whatever errand he had invented to escape the oppressive atmosphere. The boy had been finding excuses to leave all morning. Organizing the return cart. Checking the front steps for debris. Purchasing fresh ink from the market stalls.

Anything to avoid sitting in this silent tomb with his failed mentor.

Twenty-six.

Footsteps approached. Slow. Hesitant.

Not Zeph's usual energetic stride.

Cornelius's heat-sense detected a familiar thermal signature. Cooler than human baseline. Dryad-touched physiology.

Dr. Anthea Floros.

His claws froze mid-reach for paperclip twenty-seven.

"Head Librarian?" Her voice was soft. Fragile.

Cornelius forced himself to look up.

Dr. Floros stood in his office doorway, clutching her shawl around her shoulders despite the warmth of the afternoon. Her silver hair had escaped its usual neat bun, hanging in loose strands around her face. She looked older than she had four days ago when she had first burst through the library doors seeking help.

Much older.

"Doctor." Cornelius's voice came out rough. He cleared his throat. "I did not expect—that is, I thought you had returned to—"

"I am leaving tonight," she said. "The evening ferry. Imelda helped me arrange passage." She stepped into the office, her gaze moving across the organized desk, the sorted paperclips, the meticulously arranged reference volumes on the shelf behind him. "I wanted to thank you. Before I left. For trying."

The words landed like stones in Cornelius's chest.

"I did not try," he said flatly. "I failed. Completely. Publicly."

"You tried," she repeated. She moved closer, her fingers worrying at the edge of her shawl. "You spent days investigating. You climbed cliffs. You questioned witnesses. You—"

"I accused an innocent monk. Twice." Cornelius's tail lashed once against the desk leg. "I wasted Captain Theo's time with theatrical nonsense. I gave you false hope and—" His voice cracked. He stopped.

Dr. Floros was quiet for a moment. Then: "It was not your fault."

"It was entirely my fault. I saw patterns instead of evidence. I—"

"No." She shook her head, and Cornelius noticed her hands were trembling. "I mean the journal. Its loss. That was not your fault." She took a shaky breath. "It was mine."

Cornelius straightened. "Doctor, you were the victim of a theft. You cannot—"

"I have been forgetting things," she said quietly. "For months now. Small things at first. Where I left my notes. What day I had scheduled a meeting. But recently..." She sank into the chair across from his desk, the one reserved for patron consultations. "Sometimes I cannot remember conversations I had the previous day. Or I misplace objects I was certain I had put away properly."

"Dr. Floros—"

"The journal." Her voice broke. "I told you it was stolen from my room. That I had left it on my writing desk. But what if I did not? What if I put it somewhere else and simply... forgot? What if I left it at the market, or the temple archives, or—" She pressed her hands to her face. "What if there was no theft at all? What if I am just losing my mind, and you wasted days searching for something I simply misplaced through my own failing memory?"

The weight of her words settled over the office like dust.

Cornelius knew he should say something. Offer reassurance. Argue against her self-blame.

But he had no proof.

No evidence that she had not simply misplaced her own journal through absent-mindedness.

No certainty that his entire investigation had not been built on the confused recollections of a woman whose memory was failing.

Just like he'd had no proof that Brother Demos was the thief.

No evidence that the brown leather book was the stolen journal.

No certainty about anything except that he had been wrong.

"I am sorry," Dr. Floros whispered. "For wasting your time. For causing such trouble with Captain Theo and the temple. For—"

"You did not waste my time," Cornelius said. The words felt hollow. "I chose to investigate. I chose to make assumptions. I chose to—" He stopped. Started again. "Your memory may be struggling, Doctor. But theft is still the most logical explanation. Your room was locked. The window was forced open. Someone—"

"Or I opened the window myself and forgot," she said dully. "Or I never locked the door properly. Or I—" She stood abruptly. "It does not matter. The journal is gone. The Orchid blooms tonight. I will not be there to document it. Fifty years of preparation, and I missed my only chance because I cannot keep track of a single book."

She moved toward the door.

"Doctor—"

"Thank you for trying, Head Librarian." She paused in the doorway, her back to him. "Imelda was right. You are a good investigator. A good dragon. This failure was not yours. It was mine."

She left.

Her footsteps echoed through the stacks. The entrance door creaked open. Closed.

Silence returned.

Heavier than before.

Cornelius stared at the pile of unsorted paperclips.

Twenty-seven remaining.

He reached for the next one.

His claws would not close properly. They trembled. Shook.

He could not pick up a paperclip.

Could not perform the simplest task.

Could not even count to fifty without his certainty crumbling.

Cornelius set his claws flat on the desk surface and focused on breathing.

In. Out. In. Out.

Dr. Floros blamed herself.

Captain Theo had dismissed him as an incompetent amateur.

Imelda thought his pride had compromised his judgment.

Brother Demos had been publicly humiliated.

And somewhere in Solterra Bay, the real thief—if there even was a real thief—walked free.

The Moon-Scented Orchid would bloom tonight under the full moon. No one would document it. No one would protect it.

Fifty years until the next bloom.

Cornelius had failed everyone.

The library door crashed open.

Not a creak. Not a polite knock.

A bang.

Footsteps thundered through the entrance hall—running, frantic.

"Boss? Boss! Are you here? Please tell me you are here because I am dying. Actually dying. This is it. This is how I die."

Zeph burst into the office, wild-eyed and breathing hard. His hair stood up in at least seven different directions. His shirt was on backward. His feet were bare.

He was not dying.

He was panicking.

Cornelius's investigative instincts engaged automatically despite himself. "Where are your shoes?"

"I do not know!" Zeph's voice cracked. "I lost them! Or maybe I never had them? I cannot remember. Boss, you have to help me. You have to—" He stopped, staring at Cornelius's desk. "Are you counting paperclips?"

"I was organizing supplies."

"You are counting paperclips," Zeph repeated. "That is... okay. No. Not okay. Nothing is okay. Boss, Sophia sent a message. A formal invitation. To the Lantern Lighting tonight at Harbor Square. And I—I said yes. Because what else was I supposed to say? But now it is in four hours and I do not know what to wear or what to say or how to act around her when it is not in an alley behind a guest house where we are investigating a theft, and—"

"Breathe," Cornelius said.

Zeph sucked in air. "I am breathing. I am breathing so much. Too much. Is it possible to breathe too much?"

"Yes. You are hyperventilating. Sit down."

"I cannot sit down. If I sit down I will never stand up again and then I will miss the Lantern Lighting and Sophia will think I am unreliable—again—and that will be it. She will decide I am not worth her time and I will die alone surrounded by books and dust and—"

"You will not die alone surrounded by books," Cornelius said. "That is my retirement plan. You will need to find your own."

Zeph stared at him. Then, impossibly, laughed. A single, slightly hysterical bark of laughter. "That is not funny."

"It was mildly humorous."

"It was dark."

"I am a dragon. We have dark humor."

Zeph sank into the chair Dr. Floros had vacated moments before. "I cannot do this. I cannot go to the Lantern Lighting. I will mess it up. I always mess things up. Last time I saw her I was covered in fish smell and looking guilty about sneaking around a crime scene. Before that I missed our meeting because you locked me in the library. Before that—"

"Before that, she invited you to sketch Festival lanterns with her," Cornelius interrupted. "And you had a perfectly pleasant conversation about the intersection of art and science. I was there. I observed the entire interaction from a rooftop."

Zeph's eyes widened. "You what?"

"Irrelevant." Cornelius waved one claw dismissively. "The point is that Sophia Doukas has demonstrated continued interest in your company despite your previous scheduling conflicts and olfactory challenges. She would not have sent a formal invitation if she intended to reject you."

"But what if—"

"What if you worry yourself into actual illness and miss the event entirely?" Cornelius fixed him with a stern look. "That would be self-fulfilling prophecy. Irrational. Inefficient."

Zeph slumped in the chair. "I need help."

"You need shoes."

"I need more than shoes, Boss." Zeph's voice dropped. "I need... I do not know. Coaching? Support? Someone to make sure I do not say something stupid or trip over my own feet or accidentally insult her family's tile-glazing secrets?"

Cornelius's tail curled slowly around the base of his desk chair.

He knew what Zeph was asking.

What he was really asking.

"You want me to accompany you," Cornelius said.

"Yes! Exactly. You could be my wingman. Make sure I do not mess this up. You are good at noticing things. You could tell me if I am about to do something embarrassing, or if she looks bored, or—"

"I am not good at noticing things," Cornelius said quietly. "I have spent the past four days proving exactly how bad I am at noticing things."

Zeph leaned forward. "That is not true."

"I accused an innocent monk. Twice."

"You were trying to solve a theft."

"I saw patterns that did not exist."

"You were trying to help Dr. Floros."

"I failed," Cornelius said. The word came out harsh. Final. "Completely. Publicly. I have no credibility left. No authority. No—" He stopped. His claws had curled into fists against the desktop. "I am not the dragon you think I am, Zeph. I am not some brilliant investigator. I am just a librarian who cannot even protect a single stolen journal."

Silence.

Zeph was quiet for a long moment. Then: "Do you know what I think?"

"I do not require—"

"I think you are having a really bad day," Zeph continued. "Actually, a really bad four days. And you messed up. You did. I am not going to lie about that. But you know what? You also climbed a cliff in a storm to interview a hermit because you thought it would help. You crawled through ventilation ducts—which, by the way, I know about because I saw the dust on your scales yesterday morning and I am not an idiot—because you were trying to find evidence. You spent days tracking down leads and questioning witnesses and organizing a whole investigation because someone you barely knew asked for help."

"I failed her."

"You tried for her," Zeph said. "That is more than Captain Theo did. More than anyone else did." He stood. "And right now, I am asking you to try for me. Not to solve a mystery or catch a thief or prove anything to anyone. Just... come to the Lantern Lighting. Stand near me. Make sure I do not completely humiliate myself in front of the girl I like."

Cornelius looked at his assistant.

Really looked.

Zeph's shirt was on backward. His hair was chaos. His feet were bare and probably bruised from running across the cobblestones without shoes.

He had come here despite all of that.

Had asked for help despite knowing Cornelius was wallowing in defeat.

Had offered reassurance—clumsy, teenage reassurance, but genuine—despite having every right to be frustrated with his mentor's recent behavior.

Cornelius's investigation had cost Zeph his first date. Had trapped him in the library during a magical lockdown. Had repeatedly pulled him away from his personal life to chase leads that went nowhere.

And still, here he stood, asking for help.

Trusting that Cornelius might have something useful to offer.

"I am not good at social events," Cornelius said finally.

"I know."

"I do not understand human courtship rituals."

"I know."

"I will likely say something inappropriate about optimal conversation spacing or the statistical probability of relationship success."

"Probably," Zeph agreed. His mouth quirked into a half-smile. "But you will be there. That is what matters."

Cornelius's claws uncurled slowly from their fists.

He looked at the pile of unsorted paperclips. Twenty-seven remaining. A task he could complete in minutes. A simple, ordered, controllable task.

Or he could stand up. Leave the library. Walk into Harbor Square where crowds gathered and music played and lanterns swung from poles in preparation for the Twinkle Nights celebration.

Where he might encounter Captain Theo or Imelda or Dr. Floros or any number of people who had witnessed his spectacular failure this morning.

Where he would have to exist in public as a dragon who had been wrong.

Or.

Or he could go because his assistant needed him.

Not as a brilliant investigator. Not as Head Librarian. Not as anything except someone who would stand nearby and make sure Zeph did not trip over his own feet.

That was a duty he could fulfill.

That was something he could do without requiring certainty or evidence or patterns.

Just... presence.

Cornelius stood. His joints protested slightly—he had been sitting too long, hunched over his desk in his misery.

"Four hours until the Lantern Lighting?" he asked.

Zeph's face lit up. "Yes. Well, three hours and forty-seven minutes now. But yes."

"Then you have time to return home, locate your shoes, change your shirt so it faces the correct direction, and possibly do something about your hair situation."

"My hair is fine—" Zeph caught Cornelius's expression. "My hair is terrible. Got it. I will fix it." He started backing toward the door, grinning. "You are really coming? You are really going to be my wingman?"

"I am really going to ensure you do not embarrass yourself beyond recovery," Cornelius corrected. "That is not the same thing."

"Close enough." Zeph paused in the doorway. "Thank you, Boss."

"Do not thank me yet. You have not seen my social performance at Festival events. It is... not optimal."

"Better than mine, I bet."

"That is a low threshold."

Zeph laughed and disappeared into the stacks. His footsteps echoed through the library—running again, but lighter this time. Less frantic.

The entrance door banged open. Closed.

Silence returned.

But different now.

Less oppressive.

Still heavy, yes. Still weighted with failure and guilt and the knowledge that Dr. Floros was leaving tonight without her journal, without her documentation, without her fifty-year dream fulfilled.

But also with... something else.

Purpose.

Small. Immediate. Manageable.

Not solving a theft or catching a criminal or restoring his reputation.

Just standing in Harbor Square next to a nervous teenage boy who needed someone to tell him when his hair looked ridiculous.

Cornelius looked down at his desk.

Twenty-seven unsorted paperclips remained.

He could finish the task. Complete the organization. Restore order to this one small corner of his world.

Or he could leave them for later.

Trust that they would still be here when he returned.

Accept that some things could wait.

His claws hovered over the pile for a moment.

Then he turned away.

The paperclips would keep.

Zeph would not.

Cornelius moved through the stacks toward his private quarters. He needed to make himself presentable. Clean the dust from his scales properly. Ensure his spectacles were polished.

Not because he cared about the Festival.

Not because he wanted to be seen in public.

But because if he was going to serve as Zeph's wingman—whatever that meant—he should at least look like a dragon who had his circumstances under control.

Even if that was a complete fabrication.

Even if his certainty was shattered and his reputation was ruined and his investigation had failed.

He could still do this one thing.

Show up. Stand nearby. Be present.

It was not solving a mystery.

But perhaps it was enough.

For now.

For tonight.

Until he figured out what came next.

If anything came next.

Cornelius stepped into his quarters and caught sight of his reflection in the small mirror above his wash basin.

A dragon stared back.

Scales dull from stress. Eyes tired. Wings held too tight against his sides.

He looked defeated.

He was defeated.

But Zeph had still asked for his help.

That had to mean something.

Cornelius began the process of cleaning his scales, working methodically from snout to tail-tip. Restoring order to his physical appearance even if his mental state remained chaos.

Three hours and forty-seven minutes until the Lantern Lighting.

Plenty of time to make himself presentable.

To prepare for an evening of social anxiety and probably saying inappropriate things about Festival traditions.

To be a wingman.

Whatever that meant.

He would figure it out.

Somehow.
