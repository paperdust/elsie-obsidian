# Chapter 13

The wind hit Cornelius like a physical blow.

He folded his wings tight against his sides and dropped the last ten feet to the cliff trail, claws scrabbling for purchase on the limestone. The same murderous wind that had nearly peeled his scales off during his first visit to Widow's Perch roared past, carrying ocean spray and the bitter taste of salt.

His heat-sense swept the trail ahead.

Nothing.

No thermal signature where Kyriakos should be.

Cornelius crept forward, belly low to the stone. The beetles provided minimal light—just enough to outline the path's edge where it dropped away into darkness and crashing waves below. His spectacles misted immediately in the spray. He pushed them higher on his snout with one claw and kept moving.

The trail curved along the cliff face. Narrow. Treacherous.

Exactly as he remembered.

Except last time, Orestes had appeared from nowhere to guide him to the tide pools.

This time, the path was empty.

Cornelius's wings pressed tighter against his sides. His tail swept back and forth, maintaining balance as gusts tried to shove him toward the cliff edge.

Where was Kyriakos?

His heat-sense detected nothing warm-blooded ahead. Just cold stone and colder ocean wind.

Had he been wrong again?

Had he followed another false pattern and abandoned Zeph at the Festival for—

Movement.

Not heat.

Shape.

Something dark against the darker cliff wall, thirty feet ahead where the trail widened into the alcove overlooking the tide pools.

Cornelius froze.

His heat-sense focused on the shape.

Cold.

Too cold.

Stone-temperature.

But the wrong shape for stone.

Cornelius crept closer, claws silent on the limestone. The wind howled. Ocean spray misted across his scales.

Twenty feet.

Fifteen.

The shape resolved into form.

A body.

Slumped against the cliff wall with limbs at wrong angles.

Cornelius's breath caught.

Too small for Kyriakos. Wrong build entirely.

Human. Male. Old.

Wearing rough-woven cloth that blended with the stone.

Orestes.

Cornelius launched forward, abandoning stealth for speed. His claws hit the alcove's flat surface and he scrambled to the hermit's side.

Not moving.

Stone-cold to heat-sense.

No—

Wait.

Cornelius pressed one claw to Orestes's chest.

Heartbeat.

Faint. Slow. But present.

Air moved through the hermit's lungs. Shallow breaths with long pauses between.

Alive.

Barely.

Cornelius's predatory focus narrowed. His claws moved across Orestes's body, checking for injuries with the methodical precision he used for book condition assessments.

No blood. No broken bones. No obvious wounds.

But Orestes's wrists were bound behind his back with rough rope. His ankles tied together. A strip of cloth gagged his mouth.

Cornelius's talons made quick work of the bonds. The rope fell away. The gag pulled free.

Orestes's head lolled forward.

Still unconscious.

Why?

Cornelius leaned closer, examining the hermit's face in the dim beetle-light.

Orestes's lips were slightly blue. His breathing remained dangerously shallow. His thermal signature registered several degrees below normal human baseline.

Hypothermia?

No. The night was cool but not that cold. And Orestes was dryad-touched—his physiology should regulate better than baseline human.

Cornelius's heat-sense swept the immediate area.

There.

On the stone beside Orestes's hip.

A scrap of cloth. Slightly warmer than the surrounding limestone, indicating recent contact with something heat-retaining.

Cornelius picked it up carefully.

Thick fabric. Rough weave.

He held it closer to his snout.

The cloth carried residue. Chemical residue that made his nostrils burn slightly even without actively smelling it.

His mind cataloged the sensation automatically.

Similar to the alchemical preservatives used in certain bookbinding processes. Sweet undertone. Slightly caustic.

Chloroform.

Cornelius's scales prickled.

Someone had drugged Orestes.

Overpowered the hermit who could literally merge with stone and become part of the cliff face.

His claws moved across the alcove's surface, searching for additional evidence.

There.

Near the edge where the alcove overlooked the tide pools below.

A glint of reflected beetle-light.

Cornelius crept to the spot and examined it closely.

Glass.

A single shard no larger than his smallest claw.

He recognized the type immediately. Borosilicate. The same specialized laboratory glass he had found in Dr. Floros's room. The same expensive material Zeph had identified as alchemical equipment.

Cornelius's memory supplied the image with painful clarity: crushed glass shards scattered across Dr. Floros's desk. Evidence he had noted and then dismissed as her own mess.

He had been wrong then.

He picked up the shard carefully, holding it to the beetle-light.

Fresh break. Sharp edges. No weathering.

Dropped recently.

By someone carrying laboratory equipment.

Someone who had been here within the last hour.

Someone who had overpowered Orestes and left him bound and drugged.

Behind him, Orestes made a sound.

Not quite a groan. More like stone grinding against stone.

Cornelius turned.

The hermit's eyes had opened to slits. His head moved slightly, seeking orientation.

"Do not move quickly," Cornelius said. "You were drugged. Your system needs time to—"

"Lizard." Orestes's voice came out slurred. Thick. "You... came."

"I followed Kyriakos Vlahos from the Festival. I saw him heading toward—" Cornelius stopped. "Did he do this to you?"

Orestes's eyes struggled to focus. "False... Gardener."

"Yes. Kyriakos. The perfumer. Did he—"

"Waited." Orestes's hand moved weakly toward the cliff edge. "There. Watching. For the bloom."

Cornelius's tail lashed once. "Where is he now?"

"Down." Orestes managed to lift one finger, pointing toward the tide pools below the alcove. "Went... down. When I..." His words trailed off. His eyes started to drift closed again.

"Stay conscious," Cornelius ordered. "You need to remain awake. The chloroform—"

"Knows." Orestes forced the word out. "Knows I... guard it. Could not... let me... interfere."

"He attacked you."

A weak nod. "From behind. Cloth over... mouth. I tried to... merge with stone but... too fast. Chemical worked... too fast."

Cornelius's claws curled against the limestone. "When?"

"Before... moon reached... zenith. Maybe... one hour?" Orestes's thermal signature was slowly climbing back toward normal baseline. The chloroform was wearing off. "He said... midnight. When the Orchid... opens."

"Opens?"

"Blooms." Orestes's eyes focused slightly better. "Full bloom. Midnight. Full moon and... lowest tide. The petals... unfold. Release the..." He struggled for breath. "The scent."

"The Moon-Scented Orchid releases its scent at the moment of full bloom," Cornelius translated. His mind was already cataloging the implications. "That is what Kyriakos wants. Not just the plant itself. The scent."

"He called it..." Orestes coughed wetly. "Harvesting the... breath. Said the living scent... was worth ten times... a preserved cutting."

Cornelius's scales went cold.

Not metaphorically cold.

Physically cold as his circulation diverted heat to his core in response to sudden understanding.

Kyriakos was not just stealing a botanical specimen.

He was planning to harvest the Orchid's scent at the exact moment of bloom.

The living fragrance of a plant that only flowered once every fifty years.

The rarest possible perfume ingredient.

Worth a fortune to the right buyers.

And if Kyriakos captured the scent—enclosed the bloom in some kind of vessel, trapped the fragrance chemically—

The Orchid would die.

Not eventually. Not from being picked.

Immediately.

Smothered.

"He brought equipment," Cornelius said. The words came out flat. Certain. "Laboratory glass. Specialized apparatus for capturing volatile compounds. That is why you found borosilicate shards. That is what he dropped in Dr. Floros's room when he stole her journal."

Orestes nodded weakly. "Saw his... bag. Full of... glass bottles. Tubes. Metal clamps." His hand moved toward his throat in a helpless gesture. "Going to... cage it. Trap the... living breath. Bottle it like... like..."

"Like death masked as luxury," Cornelius finished. His tail lashed again. "Like crushed flowers left to rot in sugar."

"Yes." Orestes's eyes held fury despite the drug haze. "Told him... told him the Orchid was... not his to take. That the bloom was... sacred. Meant to live... one night and... die free."

"What did he say?"

Orestes's expression twisted with disgust. "Laughed. Said I was... a fool who... preferred poverty to... prosperity. That beauty was... wasted if not... owned."

Cornelius's breath weapon flickered briefly at the back of his throat. A tiny blue flame of pure rage.

He suppressed it.

Flames were not useful here.

Information was useful.

"What time is it now?" he asked.

Orestes squinted up at the sky. The moon was visible between cloud gaps, nearly at its zenith. "Quarter to... eleven bells. Maybe."

Cornelius's internal chronometer agreed. He had left the Festival around twenty past nine bells. Followed Kyriakos along the coastal path. Climbed to Widow's Perch.

Ten forty-five, approximately.

Seventy-five minutes until midnight.

Seventy-five minutes until the Orchid bloomed.

Seventy-five minutes to stop Kyriakos from smothering a once-in-fifty-years natural phenomenon for profit.

"Can you stand?" Cornelius asked.

Orestes tried to push himself upright. Failed. His arms trembled. "Not... yet. Still weak."

"Then stay here. I will—"

"No." Orestes grabbed Cornelius's foreleg with surprising strength. "You cannot... go down there. Alone. He has... the chemical. If he used it... on me, he will... use it on you."

"I am smaller. Faster. He will not—"

"You are a fool," Orestes said flatly. His voice was gaining strength as the drug cleared his system. "A brave fool. But still a fool." He leveraged himself into a sitting position, breathing hard. "The path down... is trapped."

Cornelius went still. "Trapped how?"

"Wire. Across the... narrow section. Thin steel wire at... ankle height for... someone descending. I saw him... string it while I was... tied here. Could not... warn anyone." Orestes's hand tightened on Cornelius's leg. "If you go down... fast, you will... trip. Fall. Three hundred... feet to the... tide pools."

"Then I will go slowly."

"No time." Orestes managed a bitter smile. "He planned it... perfectly. Disable the... guardian. Trap the path. Wait for... midnight. Take his... prize and leave... while I lay here... helpless."

Cornelius's claws scraped against stone.

Kyriakos had outmaneuvered them.

Outmaneuvered everyone.

Stolen the journal. Used its maps and research to locate the Orchid. Arrived early enough to neutralize Orestes and secure his position. Set traps to prevent interference.

And now he waited below with his laboratory apparatus, ready to cage the bloom the moment it opened.

Seventy-five minutes.

"Can you merge with the stone yet?" Cornelius asked. "Travel through the cliff face to the pools below?"

Orestes shook his head. "Not while the... chloroform is still... in my blood. Merging requires... full control of... my physiology. I am too... unstable. I would get... stuck. Trapped inside... the stone."

"Then we need another approach."

"There is no... other approach. The path is... the only way down... unless you can fly... directly to the pools. But the wind..." Orestes gestured at the howling gale that tore past the alcove. "You saw it. Felt it. Even a... dragon cannot fly... in that. You would be... dashed against the... cliffs."

Cornelius's wings shifted against his sides.

Orestes was right.

The wind was too strong for controlled flight. The cliff face too vertical and jagged for safe gliding. And the darkness made navigation nearly impossible even with his heat-sense.

Trying to fly down would be suicide.

But the path was trapped.

And they had seventy-five minutes.

"There has to be a way," Cornelius said. His mind raced through possibilities, cataloging and discarding options with the same methodical process he used for shelving decisions. "Could you—if I helped you stand—could you remove the wire from here? Telekinetically or through stone manipulation?"

"I am dryad-touched. Not a mage." Orestes coughed again. "I merge with... living stone. I do not... control it at a distance."

"What about alerting someone in town? Captain Theo could send Watch officers. They could—"

"Arrive in an... hour at best. Too late." Orestes pulled himself fully upright, leaning heavily against the cliff wall. "You need to... go now. Before midnight. Before the... bloom opens."

"I cannot fly in this wind. The path is trapped. You just said—"

"I said you... could not fly to... the pools." Orestes's eyes focused more clearly now. Some of his usual sharpness returned to his expression. "I did not... say you could not... fly to the wire."

Cornelius went very still.

"The wire is... fifty feet down," Orestes continued. "Strung across the... narrowest section of... the path. You could... glide that far. Even in the wind. Land above it. Descend on foot... from there. Carefully."

"And then what? Kyriakos will see me coming. He has chloroform. He could—"

"He is watching... the pools. Not the path." Orestes's voice gained conviction. "I saw where he... positioned himself. In the... shadow of the... rock formation beside... the largest pool. His attention is... on the Orchid. Waiting for... first petal-movement. He will not... expect interference from... above."

Cornelius's tail curled and uncurled as he processed this.

Fifty-foot glide in dangerous wind.

Land on a narrow cliff path in darkness.

Descend carefully past the wire trap.

Approach an armed criminal who had already demonstrated willingness to use chemical weapons.

Stop him from smothering a priceless natural phenomenon.

All in seventy-five minutes.

This was a terrible plan.

"You have a... better idea?" Orestes asked, reading his expression.

"No."

"Then you should... go."

Cornelius looked at the hermit. Orestes was still pale. Still weak. But his thermal signature was steadily approaching normal baseline. The chloroform was clearing.

"If I fail," Cornelius said quietly, "you will recover in time to—"

"If you fail... the Orchid dies." Orestes's voice was hard. "And the False... Gardener walks away... with his prize. And next time... he will be more... careful. More thorough. He will not... leave witnesses alive."

The implication hung in the air between them.

Kyriakos had left Orestes alive this time because he believed the hermit would remain unconscious until long after midnight. Until long after Kyriakos had taken his prize and departed.

But if he felt threatened?

If he realized his plan was compromised?

A man who would drug and bind an elderly hermit would not hesitate to push that same hermit off a cliff.

"Go," Orestes said. "Stop him. Save the... Orchid. That is all... that matters."

Cornelius wanted to argue.

Wanted to express the many ways this plan could fail catastrophically.

Wanted to point out that he was a librarian, not a hero, and his recent investigative record demonstrated spectacular failures in judgment.

But Orestes was right.

The Orchid mattered.

Dr. Floros's stolen life work mattered.

Stopping Kyriakos from turning beauty into possession mattered.

Even if Cornelius was wrong again.

Even if he failed again.

He had to try.

"Seventy-five minutes," he said.

"Seventy-three now," Orestes corrected. He managed a thin smile. "You are wasting... time."

Cornelius moved to the alcove's edge.

The wind immediately tried to shove him backward. His claws dug into the limestone. His wings spread slightly, testing the air currents.

Chaotic.

Unpredictable.

Exactly the conditions he had struggled with during his first visit to Widow's Perch.

"The wire is... fifty feet down," Orestes called over the wind. "On the path's... right side. Knee-height for a... human. You will see it... if you look... carefully."

Cornelius nodded. His heat-sense was useless for detecting steel wire. He would have to rely on vision alone.

In darkness.

In wind-driven spray.

While gliding.

This was absolutely a terrible plan.

Cornelius launched.

The wind caught him immediately, shoving him sideways toward the open ocean. His wings angled hard, fighting for control. The cliff face blurred past too fast.

Twenty feet down.

Thirty.

The path below was a dark line against darker stone.

Forty feet.

The wind gusted. Cornelius's left wing folded involuntarily. He spun.

Forty-five feet.

He could not see the wire.

Could not see anything except stone and spray and darkness.

Fifty feet.

Now.

Cornelius folded his wings completely and dropped the last six feet straight down.

His claws hit the path hard. Too hard. He rolled, scraping scales against limestone, and fetched up against the cliff wall with his tail hanging over the edge into empty air.

For a moment he just lay there, breathing hard.

That had been deeply undignified.

Also effective.

He was alive. On the path. Below the alcove where Orestes waited.

Cornelius pulled himself fully onto the path and stood carefully.

His heat-sense swept the area below.

There.

Fifty feet further down, where the path curved around a rock outcropping.

A warm thermal signature. Human-sized. Satyr-kin physiology.

Sitting motionless beside the tide pools.

Kyriakos.

Waiting for midnight.

Waiting for the bloom.

Cornelius looked back up at the alcove. He could barely see Orestes's shape against the cliff wall.

Seventy-three minutes until midnight.

Cornelius turned and began his descent.

Carefully.

Silently.

Toward the False Gardener who had stolen Dr. Floros's life work and now planned to smother the Moon-Scented Orchid for profit.

The Hunt continued.

And this time, Cornelius would not fail.

He could not fail.

Too much depended on it.

Everything depended on it.

His claws found purchase on the stone.

The wind howled.

The ocean crashed below.

And somewhere in the darkness ahead, a once-in-fifty-years bloom prepared to open its petals under the full moon.

Cornelius crept forward.

Step by careful step.

Toward the wire.

Toward Kyriakos.

Toward either redemption or another catastrophic failure.

He would know which in seventy-three minutes.
