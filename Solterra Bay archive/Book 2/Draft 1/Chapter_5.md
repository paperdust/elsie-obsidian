# Chapter 5

The library had never felt more perfectly ordered than it did at this moment.

Cornelius sat at his desk, the investigation notes spread before him in neat rows. Each piece of evidence occupied its designated space. The timeline ran left to right across the blotter. The witness statements formed a secondary column. The physical evidence—transcribed descriptions of the borosilicate glass, the dust pattern, the perfume—anchored the bottom of the arrangement.

Beautiful. Logical. Irrefutable.

He had spent the past hour reviewing everything, confirming what he already knew: Brother Demos was the thief. The pattern was too clear to be coincidence. Temple scholar requests botanical texts. Library book on coastal herbs goes missing. Scholar approaches botanist about rare plants. Botanist's journal is stolen. Scholar is observed fleeing with a brown leather book.

Simple cause and effect. Elementary deduction.

Tomorrow morning, he would present this evidence to the head priest. The temple authorities would have no choice but to grant him access to Demos's quarters. He would recover both stolen volumes, restore them to their proper places, and the world would return to its correct configuration.

Cornelius allowed himself a small, satisfied rumble.

The front door of the library opened.

He looked up, prepared to inform whatever Festival-addled patron had wandered in that the library was closed for the evening. But the figure that slipped through the doorway was not a patron.

It was Brother Demos.

Cornelius went absolutely still.

The monk moved quickly but quietly, his gray robes whispering against the tile floor. He carried a canvas satchel over one shoulder. His hood was pulled low, shadowing his face. He did not look toward the main desk. Instead, he turned immediately toward the Herbaria Medica section—the botanical texts—and began scanning the shelves.

Looking for something.

Or returning something.

Cornelius's mind moved through the possibilities with crystalline clarity. Demos had come to the library. At night. When he believed it to be empty. To access the botanical collection.

The thief. In his library. *Now.*

Every scale on Cornelius's body locked into alignment. This was not a theory anymore. This was not circumstantial evidence or witness testimony. This was the culprit, caught in the act.

He could confront Demos directly. Demand the return of the stolen journals. But the monk was larger than him, and humans had an unfortunate tendency toward panic when cornered. Demos might bolt. Or worse—he might damage something in his flight.

No. Cornelius needed to contain the situation. Control it. Ensure that the thief could not escape and that the evidence would be preserved for official documentation.

He needed the lockdown.

Cornelius's gaze moved to the brass panel mounted on the wall beside his desk. The emergency protocols. He had installed them decades ago, after a particularly concerning incident involving a scroll thief and a second-story window. The system had cost a small fortune in enchantment fees, but Cornelius had never regretted the expense.

Code Obsidian. Total library lockdown.

Every door would seal. Every window would lock. The building would become impenetrable until Cornelius himself deactivated the sequence.

Perfect.

His claw moved toward the activation rune.

Then he hesitated.

Code Obsidian also triggered an automatic alert to the Town Watch. It was a legal requirement—any magical containment system had to notify the authorities to prevent unlawful imprisonment. Which meant that activating the lockdown would bring Captain Theo directly to his door.

Cornelius's tail twitched in annoyance.

He had spent the better part of a year avoiding Theo after the incident with the overdue municipal charter. The man was tedious. Bureaucratic. He would demand explanations and paperwork and probably insist on processing Demos through official channels, which would take hours and involve endless forms.

But.

The lockdown would also trap Brother Demos with irrefutable certainty. And when Theo arrived, he would find Cornelius standing over a thief caught red-handed in the library's restricted collection. The evidence would be undeniable. The case would be closed.

And Cornelius would be vindicated.

Publicly. Officially. In front of the very Watch captain who had once lectured him about "proper investigative procedure."

The satisfaction of that image was too delicious to resist.

Cornelius pressed his claw to the activation rune.

The library *screamed*.

Not a human scream—a mechanical one. A grinding, shrieking wail of metal and magic as the lockdown sequence engaged. The sound came from everywhere at once: the walls, the ceiling, the very stones beneath the floor.

Brother Demos jerked upright, spinning toward the entrance.

The main doors slammed shut with a sound like thunder. Iron bars shot across them from recessed housings in the doorframe, sliding into place with precise, brutal efficiency. The windows followed—shutters dropping from above, locking mechanisms engaging with sharp *clicks* that echoed through the main hall.

Every exit. Every opening. Sealed.

The wailing continued for another three seconds, then cut off abruptly, leaving a ringing silence in its wake.

Cornelius hopped down from his desk and walked calmly toward the Herbaria Medica section.

Brother Demos stood frozen beside Shelf Seven, Row B. His hood had fallen back, revealing a thin face with wide, terrified eyes. He looked young—perhaps thirty. His hands were empty, but the canvas satchel hung heavy against his side.

"Good evening, Brother Demos," Cornelius said. His voice was perfectly level. Perfectly controlled. "I am Cornelius Drake, Head Librarian of Solterra Bay. You are currently in violation of library protocol, trespassing statute, and—I suspect—theft law. I have activated a Code Obsidian lockdown. The Town Watch has been notified and will arrive shortly. I suggest you remain exactly where you are."

Demos's mouth opened. Closed. Opened again. "I—this is a mistake—"

"The only mistake," Cornelius said, "was yours. In believing you could steal from my library without consequence."

"I did not steal anything!"

"Then you will not object to a search of your person and your bag."

Demos clutched the satchel closer. "You have no right—"

"I have every right. This is my library. You entered it after hours, without permission, and proceeded directly to the section from which a volume was recently stolen. Your behavior is consistent with that of a thief returning to the scene of his crime. Or perhaps"—Cornelius's gaze fixed on the satchel—"attempting to steal additional materials."

"No! I was only—I needed to check a reference—"

"At night. In secret. How convenient."

Demos backed up a step. His shoulders hit the bookshelf. A small volume wobbled but did not fall. Cornelius made a mental note to reshelf it properly once this unpleasantness was concluded.

"I have done nothing wrong," Demos said. His voice had gone thin and high. Panicked. "I am a scholar. I use this library regularly. I have every right to—"

"You have the right to use the library during operating hours, with proper check-out procedures, and under the supervision of library staff. None of which apply to your current situation." Cornelius sat back on his haunches, tail curled neatly around his feet. "Now. We can wait here in civilized silence for Captain Theo to arrive. Or you can make this easier on yourself and simply hand over the stolen materials now."

"I do not have any stolen materials!"

"Then you will not mind when the Watch searches you."

Demos's face had gone pale. He looked toward the sealed doors, then back to Cornelius. His hands knotted together. "This is... this is harassment. I will report you to the temple authorities. The head priest will—"

"The head priest will be very interested to learn that one of his scholars has been stealing rare botanical texts," Cornelius said smoothly. "I am certain he will want to discuss the matter with you. At length."

A sound came from the back of the library. Footsteps, rapid and irregular.

Zeph emerged from the Biography section, where he had apparently been shelving returns. His hair stuck up at odd angles, and he had changed into what he probably believed were Festival-appropriate clothes: a clean linen shirt the color of cream, trousers that did not bear fish scales, and a vest embroidered with small bronze beetles.

He stopped when he saw the barred doors. "Boss? What—did you just trigger the lockdown?"

"Yes."

"Why?"

Cornelius gestured toward Brother Demos with one wing. "I have apprehended our thief."

Zeph's gaze moved to the monk. Recognition flickered across his face. "That's him? That's the guy who stole—wait. Boss. What time is it?"

"Approximately nine bells."

"Nine—" Zeph's expression shifted from confusion to horror. "No. No, no, no. I'm supposed to meet Sophia at nine bells. At the fountain. We're going to watch the lantern lighting—"

"You will have to reschedule," Cornelius said. "We have a more pressing matter to address."

"But—Boss—I can't just—" Zeph gestured helplessly toward the sealed doors. "How long is the lockdown going to last?"

"Until the situation is resolved."

"How long is that?"

"As long as necessary."

Zeph looked like he wanted to argue. His hands moved through his hair, destroying whatever careful arrangement he had achieved earlier. "This is—okay. Okay. Can I at least—is there any way to send her a message? So she knows I'm not just standing her up?"

"The lockdown is total," Cornelius said. "No one enters or exits until I deactivate it."

"So I'm just stuck here."

"Yes."

"And Sophia is going to think I ditched her."

"That is unfortunate but irrelevant."

Zeph's jaw tightened. He shot a look at Brother Demos that was not entirely friendly, then crossed his arms and leaned against the nearest shelf. "Fine. Great. Perfect. This is exactly how I wanted tonight to go."

"Your romantic disappointments are noted," Cornelius said. "Now please be quiet. I am conducting an interrogation."

Before Zeph could respond, a new sound cut through the library: heavy, rhythmic pounding on the main doors.

"Town Watch!" a voice bellowed. "Open up!"

Captain Theo. Right on schedule.

Cornelius felt a small thrill of satisfaction. Everything was proceeding exactly as it should. He glided to the control panel and deactivated the lockdown sequence.

The iron bars retracted. The door locks disengaged with a series of sharp clicks. The main doors swung open.

Captain Theo Melas stood on the threshold, breathing hard. He wore his Watch uniform—leather armor over a practical tunic, a short sword at his belt, and a deeply annoyed expression. Behind him stood two junior Watch officers, both looking wary.

Theo's gaze found Cornelius. "Drake. What in the name of every reasonable law is going on?"

"Good evening, Captain," Cornelius said. "I have detained a suspect in an ongoing theft investigation. I require your assistance in searching his person and recovering stolen property."

Theo stared at him. "You triggered a Code Obsidian lockdown. For a *book theft*."

"Two book thefts, actually. And yes."

"Do you have any idea how many regulations that violates? Code Obsidian is for emergencies. Active threats. Not—" He gestured vaguely at Brother Demos, who had not moved from his position against the bookshelf. "Not scholars browsing after hours."

"He is not browsing," Cornelius said. "He is trespassing. And I have reason to believe he is carrying stolen materials."

Theo rubbed his face with both hands. He looked as though he had not slept in several days. "Reason to believe. Do you have evidence?"

"I have a pattern of behavior consistent with—"

"Evidence. Physical evidence. Witnesses. Something other than your*reasoning*."

Cornelius's scales prickled. "I observed him enter the library after hours and proceed directly to the section from which a volume was previously stolen. That is sufficient grounds for detention and search."

"That's grounds for asking him to leave," Theo said. "Not for locking down a municipal building and triggering a Watch emergency response."

"I am the Head Librarian. This is my library. I have the authority to—"

"You have the authority to manage the collection. Not to imprison scholars." Theo turned to Brother Demos. "You. What are you doing here?"

Demos had recovered some composure. His hands were still shaking, but his voice was steadier. "I came to check a reference for my research. I did not realize the library was closed. The door was unlocked."

"It was not unlocked," Cornelius said. "I was working in my office. You entered without announcing yourself and went directly to the restricted texts."

"I did not know you were here! I saw no lights in the front hall. I assumed—"

"You assumed incorrectly."

Theo held up one hand. "Everyone stop talking." He looked at Demos. "What's in the bag?"

"My research materials. Notes. Sketches. Nothing stolen."

"You will not object to showing me."

Demos hesitated, then slowly opened the canvas satchel and held it out.

Theo reached in and removed the contents one item at a time: A leather-bound notebook. A wooden case containing drawing pencils. A folded cloth that, when opened, revealed several dried plant specimens pressed between sheets of thin paper. A small magnifying glass. A stoppered ink bottle.

No brown leather journal with a pressed-flower cover.

Cornelius felt something cold settle in his chest.

"Anything else?" Theo asked.

"No," Demos said. "That is everything."

Theo checked the bag's interior, running his hands along the seams. Then he handed it back. "It's clean."

"He must have hidden it," Cornelius said. The words came out sharper than he intended. "He knew I was here. He concealed the stolen journal somewhere in the library before I could apprehend him."

"Did you see him hide anything?" Theo asked.


"No, but—"

"Did you see him carrying a brown leather journal when he entered?"

"I saw his satchel. He could easily have—"

"That is not an answer to my question." Theo's voice had gone flat. Bureaucratic. "Did you, with your own eyes, observe this man carrying or concealing the stolen journal?"

Cornelius's tail lashed. "No. But the evidence clearly indicates—"

"I need facts. Not patterns." Theo turned back to Demos. "Did you take anything from this library tonight?"

"No, sir."

"Have you ever taken anything from this library without proper check-out procedures?"

"No, sir."

"Do you have any knowledge of the stolen journal belonging to Dr. Anthea Floros?"

Demos blinked. "Dr. Floros's journal was stolen? I did not know. That is terrible. Her work is invaluable."

He sounded sincere. Concerned, even.

Cornelius's claws dug into the floor tiles. "He is lying. He approached Dr. Floros in the market. He questioned her about her research. He was seen fleeing this library with a brown leather book—"

"By whom?" Theo asked.

"By me."

"When?"

"Yesterday afternoon. During the Festival preparations."

"And did you stop him? Question him? Verify that the book he carried was actually stolen property?"

Cornelius went still.

No. He had not done any of those things. He had seen a gray-robed figure running with a book and immediately assumed it was Demos. Assumed it was Dr. Floros's journal. Assumed guilt.

The pattern had been so clear. The logic so obvious.

But he had not actually *verified* anything.

"I..." Cornelius's voice trailed off.

Theo waited.

"I did not stop him at that time," Cornelius said carefully. "I planned to confront him formally, with proper evidence and institutional support."

"So you triggered a lockdown instead."

"Yes."

Theo was silent for a long moment. Then he turned to Brother Demos. "You're free to go."

"What?" Cornelius's voice came out as a strangled hiss. "No. You must search the library. He has hidden the journal somewhere. I am certain—"

"You are not certain," Theo said. "You are guessing. And I am not tearing apart a library based on guesswork." He looked at Demos. "Go. Now. Before I change my mind."

The monk did not need to be told twice. He clutched his satchel to his chest and moved toward the door. As he passed Cornelius, his expression shifted—just for a moment. Fear melted away, replaced by something that looked almost like satisfaction.

A small, private smile.

Then he was gone, disappearing into the Festival-bright streets beyond.

Cornelius stared after him, scales rigid with disbelief.

Theo dismissed the two junior officers with a nod. They left, closing the library doors behind them. Then the captain turned his full attention to Cornelius.

"You just harassed a temple scholar," he said. His voice was quiet. Dangerous. "You imprisoned him using emergency protocols designed for active threats. You accused him of theft without evidence. You wasted Watch resources on a personal vendetta. Do you understand how many laws you just violated?"

"He is the thief," Cornelius said. But his voice had lost its certainty. "The pattern—"

"Is not evidence. And even if it were, you do not have the authority to detain and search citizens on suspicion alone. You are a librarian. Not a Watch captain. Not a magistrate. You catalog books. You do not arrest people."

Each word landed like a physical blow.

Cornelius's claws scraped against the tile. "I am the Head Librarian. I have a responsibility to protect—"

"You have a responsibility to follow the law," Theo said. "Which you just failed to do. Spectacularly." He pulled a small notebook from his belt and began writing. "I am officially documenting this incident. If you pull something like this again, I will have you charged with unlawful imprisonment and misuse of emergency systems. Do I make myself clear?"

Cornelius could not speak. His throat had closed around the words.

Theo finished writing and returned the notebook to his belt. "Stay out of Watch business, Drake. If you have evidence of an actual crime, bring it to me. Through proper channels. Like a civilized citizen." He turned toward the door, then paused. "And for the record? I was actually planning to help you with this case. Dr. Floros came to me this morning. I was going to interview Brother Demos tomorrow, officially, with a proper warrant. But you just destroyed any chance of that. Congratulations."

He left.

The library doors closed behind him with a soft, final click.

Silence settled over the main hall.

Cornelius stood very still, staring at the space where Brother Demos had stood. Where the thief—the suspect—the *innocent scholar*—had smiled at him before walking away.

Behind him, Zeph made a strangled sound. "Boss, I—look, I have to—Sophia is waiting, and if I run I might still catch her before she leaves—"

"Go," Cornelius said. His voice came out flat. Empty.

"Are you sure? Because I can stay if you need—"

"Go."

Zeph hesitated for one more second. Then he bolted for the door.

Cornelius listened to his footsteps fade into the Festival noise beyond. Listened to the laughter and music and celebration happening in the streets outside. Listened to the awful, ringing silence inside his library.

He had been so certain.

The pattern had been perfect. Brother Demos requesting botanical texts. The timeline aligning. The hooded figure in the alley. The brown leather book. Every piece of evidence pointing in the same direction.

But he had been wrong.

Or—no. Not wrong. Incomplete. He had not been wrong about the pattern. He had simply... overlooked something. Some piece of the puzzle that did not fit the neat, logical framework he had constructed.

The borosilicate glass. The expensive perfume. Kyriakos Vlahos at the Seacliff Villa.

Anomalies. Details that did not align with a poor temple scholar.

Details he had dismissed because they complicated the simple, elegant solution.

Cornelius turned slowly and looked at his desk. At the investigation notes still spread across the blotter in their careful arrangement.

All that work. All that certainty.

And he had just humiliated himself in front of Captain Theo. Harassed an innocent scholar. Triggered an emergency lockdown for nothing.

The great investigator. The brilliant logician.

A fool.

Cornelius walked back to his desk. He gathered up the notes, one sheet at a time, and placed them in a neat stack. Then he picked up his pen and wrote a single word across the top page:

*WRONG.*

He stared at it for a long moment.

Then he climbed into his chair, folded his wings carefully against his sides, and sat alone in his perfectly ordered library, listening to the Festival celebrate outside while the weight of his failure pressed down on his scales like a physical thing.

Somewhere out there, Dr. Floros's journal was still missing. The real thief was still free. And Cornelius had just destroyed any credibility he might have had to solve the case.

The Hunt, it seemed, was over.
