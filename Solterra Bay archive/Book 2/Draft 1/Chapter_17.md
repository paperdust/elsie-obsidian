# Chapter 17

They reached the final switchback thirty feet below the summit and Cornelius's entire body was screaming.

Not metaphorically.

His claws burned from gripping limestone. His wings ached from being held folded for so long. His tail had developed a tremor from constant counterbalance work.

He had climbed this cliff twice in one night.

That was twice too many.

Zeph collapsed against the cliff wall beside him, breathing hard. Blood from his torn palms smeared the stone. His thermal signature was spiking—exhaustion combined with adrenaline.

"Boss," he managed between breaths. "Please tell me we are almost there."

"Thirty feet." Cornelius's heat-sense mapped the path above. The summit was close. So close. "The path levels out after the next turn."

"Good. Because I cannot feel my hands."

Movement on the switchback below caught Cornelius's attention. Two figures climbing steadily upward.

Sophia and Orestes.

Finally.

They reached the landing a minute later. Sophia's face was flushed from exertion. Orestes moved like someone fighting invisible resistance—the chloroform still affecting his coordination even hours later.

"You made it," Sophia said. Not a question. Relief.

"Barely." Zeph held up his bleeding hands. "The rooftops were a terrible idea."

"The rooftops were efficient," Cornelius corrected. He turned to Orestes. "Where is Kyriakos?"

Orestes pointed up. "Summit. He reached it maybe five minutes ago. Now he is descending the tide pool path."

Five minutes.

They had closed the gap.

Not enough. But closer.

"How much time until midnight?" Sophia asked.

Cornelius checked the moon's position. Did the calculation. "Fourteen minutes. Perhaps fifteen."

"And how long until he reaches the Orchid?"

"Unknown. The descent is steep but navigable. With a lantern and prior reconnaissance—" Cornelius's tail curled. "Ten minutes. Maybe less."

The numbers assembled with terrible clarity.

They were out of time.

Even if they reached the summit immediately. Even if they descended at maximum speed.

Kyriakos would reach the Orchid first.

"We could shout," Zeph said. "Alert him. Make him know we are coming."

"No." Orestes's voice was sharp. "If you corner him, he will destroy the evidence."

Cornelius's scales prickled. "Explain."

"He brought the journal. Dr. Floros's research. If he believes capture is imminent, he will burn it. Throw it into the ocean. Remove any proof connecting him to the theft."

"The jar," Cornelius said. "We have the jar. Sophia can identify it as her work."

"You have glass fragments." Orestes leaned heavily against the cliff wall. His dryad-touched physiology was fighting the residual chloroform but losing. "Fragments prove someone had laboratory equipment. They do not prove Kyriakos used them to harvest an endangered species."

Sophia made a frustrated sound. "The journal is the only direct evidence. It has his fingerprints. His notes in the margins where he cross-referenced Dr. Floros's environmental data."

"Then we cannot let him destroy it," Zeph said.

"We cannot reach him before he reaches the Orchid," Cornelius countered. "The mathematics are clear. He has position. He has speed. We are exhausted and injured and—"

He stopped.

His mind had caught on something.

Something Orestes said.

*You have glass fragments.*

No.

They had more than fragments.

They had seen the complete jar back in Chapter 14 when Sophia described commissioning it. When she explained its purpose.

The specialized container.

Airtight.

Lead-reinforced.

With a one-way valve allowing gases to enter but never leave once sealed.

"The jar," Cornelius said slowly. "Is it still intact? Or did Kyriakos break it during the excavation?"

"Why does—" Sophia stopped. Her eyes widened. "You think he brought it with him."

"I think he designed an entire operation around that jar. Commissioned it specifically. Paid significant money for custom glasswork." Cornelius's tail was curling and uncurling rapidly now. The gesture he made when solving a particularly complex cataloging problem. "He would not leave it behind."

"But the Orchid has not bloomed yet," Zeph said. "So the jar is empty."

"Empty but present." Cornelius looked at Sophia. "You said the jar was unbreakable. That you designed it to withstand significant pressure."

"Borosilicate glass walls. Lead-reinforced rim." Sophia's voice shifted. Became the precise tone she used when discussing technical specifications. "It could survive a fall from this height. Multiple impacts. Even direct heat from an alchemical torch would not crack it."

"What about the seal?" Cornelius asked. "The mechanism that closes it?"

"It is a threaded cap. Like a bottle. But with an interior gasket that creates an airtight seal once pressure equalizes." Sophia's hands moved, sketching the invisible shape in the air. "The gasket is lead. Soft enough to deform and fill microscopic gaps. Hard enough to maintain structural integrity."

"Lead," Cornelius repeated.

And there it was.

The solution.

Assembling in his mind with the same perfect clarity as a properly organized card catalog.

Lead.

Soft metal.

Melting point: approximately 327 degrees.

Dragon fire temperature: sufficient for welding minor metal repairs in manuscript binding equipment.

Well above 327 degrees.

"We do not need to stop him from collecting the gas," Cornelius said quietly. "We need to seal it inside permanently."

Sophia stared at him. "What?"

"The jar is evidence. But only if it contains the Orchid's pheromones." Cornelius's claws gripped stone. His mind was racing now. Cataloging. Organizing. "If Kyriakos flees with an empty jar, we prove nothing. If he flees with a sealed jar containing a protected species' reproductive compounds, we prove intent. We prove harvest. We prove everything."

"But he will open it," Zeph said. "Later. In his workshop. He will extract the compounds and destroy the evidence."

"Not if the seal is permanent."

Silence on the switchback.

Then Sophia said, very carefully: "You want to weld it shut."

"I want to melt the lead gasket." Cornelius looked at her. "My fire is hot enough to liquefy lead but not so hot it would crack borosilicate glass. If I can apply heat directly to the seal while the jar is closed—"

"The lead melts," Sophia finished. Her voice was picking up speed. Energy. "Flows into the threads. Fuses the cap to the rim. Creates a permanent metallurgical bond."

"And traps the pheromones inside forever," Orestes said. Something like approval entered his voice. "A sealed confession."

"Exactly." Cornelius's tail lashed once. "Kyriakos designed that jar to be unbreakable. We turn that strength against him. Make it a prison for evidence he cannot destroy."

Zeph was nodding slowly. "Okay. Okay, that is actually brilliant. But there is one problem."

"What?"

"You weigh maybe twelve pounds. Kyriakos is a full-grown satyr. If he sees you coming, he will just—" Zeph made a kicking gesture. "You know. Remove you from the situation."

Valid concern.

Extremely valid.

Cornelius had not survived thirty-seven years as a Library Dragon by engaging in direct physical confrontation with beings five times his weight.

"Then we create an opening," he said. "A moment where Kyriakos is distracted. Focused elsewhere. Believes himself secure."

"How?" Sophia asked.

Cornelius looked at Zeph.

Zeph looked back.

"No," Zeph said.

"You are charismatic. Personable. Capable of engaging someone in conversation even under significant stress."

"Boss, I am not walking up to a guy who chloroformed a hermit and asking for his autograph."

"Not his autograph." Cornelius's mind was already sketching the approach. The timing. The exact sequence of actions required. "An explanation. A demonstration. You expressed interest in his perfume work back at the pavilion. Use that. Be the enthusiastic apprentice asking questions about technique."

"While you sneak up behind him and weld his evidence jar shut."

"Precisely."

"That is insane."

"That is our only option." Cornelius looked at the moon. At the inexorable movement toward midnight. "We have twelve minutes. Maybe thirteen. Kyriakos will reach the Orchid in eight. The bloom happens at midnight. Which means we have perhaps four minutes between his arrival and the moment the pheromones release."

"Four minutes to climb the rest of this cliff, descend the tide pool path, approach Kyriakos without alerting him, engage him in conversation, and weld a jar shut." Zeph laughed. It sounded slightly unhinged. "Sure. Easy."

"Not easy," Cornelius corrected. "Necessary."

Sophia touched Zeph's shoulder. "I will go with you. Two is more believable than one. We are both young. Both curious about his work. We can sell it."

"What about me?" Orestes asked.

"You guard the path." Cornelius looked at him. "If Kyriakos tries to flee back toward the summit, you stop him."

"How? I can barely merge with stone right now."

"Then improvise. Trip him. Make noise. Alert us." Cornelius's claws scraped against limestone. "But he will not flee upward. He will flee downward. Toward the ocean. Toward the route he scouted earlier."

"And when he runs?"

"We let him." Cornelius's tail curled with something approaching satisfaction. "Because he will be carrying a sealed jar full of protected genetic material. Evidence Captain Theo cannot dismiss. Cannot ignore. Cannot wave away as draconic melodrama."

The plan assembled.

Not elegant.

Not safe.

But possible.

Maybe.

"Positions," Cornelius said. "Zeph and Sophia approach from the path. Engaged. Visible. Non-threatening. I come from above. From the rocks. Kyriakos will be focused on the Orchid. On the bloom. His attention will be directed downward."

"And when the pheromones release?" Sophia asked.

"I seal the jar immediately. Before Kyriakos can process what is happening. Before he can stop me."

"Your fire is small," Orestes said. Not criticism. Observation. "Can you generate enough heat to melt lead in the time available?"

Cornelius thought about his breath weapon.

The tiny blue flame he used for mending torn manuscript pages.

For welding broken spectacle frames.

For fusing cracked pottery back into usable forms.

Small.

Precise.

Hot.

He had never tried to melt something as large as a jar seal before.

But he had melted lead before.

In controlled conditions.

Over careful preparation.

This would not be controlled.

This would be desperate.

But the alternative was watching Kyriakos walk away with a jar that would be opened in privacy and emptied in safety.

"Yes," Cornelius said. "I can do it."

He hoped that was true.

Zeph stood. Tested his bloody hands. "Okay. Then we go now."

"Wait." Sophia pulled something from her bag. A strip of cloth. "Let me wrap those."

She bound Zeph's palms quickly. Efficiently. The same competent movements she used when assembling glazed tiles.

Zeph flexed his fingers. "Better. Thanks."

"Do not die," Sophia said.

"That is the plan."

They started climbing.

The final thirty feet felt longer than the entire ascent combined.

Cornelius's claws found holds automatically now. Muscle memory replacing conscious thought. His heat-sense mapped the path above.

Twenty feet.

Fifteen.

The summit.

Flat stone. Wind-carved and ancient.

Beyond it, the tide pool path descended in switchbacks toward the ocean.

Cornelius crept to the edge. His heat-sense swept the area below.

There.

A warm thermal signature kneeling beside the largest tide pool.

Kyriakos.

His posture was focused. Intent. He was doing something with his hands. Preparing equipment. Positioning the jar.

The Orchid was directly below him.

Still protected by the circle of baked earth Cornelius had created hours ago.

But Kyriakos had tools.

A small trowel sat beside his knee. Sharp. Metal. Capable of chipping through hardened soil given enough time.

He was making progress.

Slow progress.

But progress.

"He is there," Cornelius said quietly. "Pools. Eastern edge. Kneeling."

Zeph moved beside him. Looked down. "I cannot see anything."

"Trust me."

"Always do." Zeph turned to Sophia. "Ready?"

"Ready."

They started down the tide pool path.

Walking.

Not running.

Not sneaking.

Just two young people navigating a steep trail in darkness.

Cornelius waited until they were twenty feet down the path.

Then he moved.

Not along the path.

Along the rocks.

The cliff face here was broken. Fragmented. Centuries of storms had created ledges and outcroppings that ran parallel to the official trail.

Harder to navigate.

Invisible from below.

Perfect.

Cornelius descended in silence.

His claws gripped stone worn smooth by salt spray.

His wings stayed folded.

His breath weapon flickered at the back of his throat. Ready. Prepared.

Below, Zeph's voice drifted up.

Loud.

Deliberately loud.

"—cannot believe we actually found you up here! Sophia said you were the Kyriakos Vlahos and I told her no way but—"

Cornelius could not hear Kyriakos's response.

But the thermal signature shifted.

Straightened.

Turned toward the approaching voices.

Good.

Distracted.

Cornelius dropped another ten feet.

He was almost level with the pools now.

Almost in position.

Sophia's voice joined Zeph's. "We saw your exhibition at the pavilion. The meridian collection? Absolutely stunning. The way you layered the citrus notes over the base—"

Flattery.

Intelligent flattery.

Appealing to Kyriakos's vanity while appearing harmless and starstruck.

It was working.

The thermal signature had turned fully away from the Orchid now.

Facing upslope.

Engaging with the interruption.

Cornelius reached the final outcropping.

Five feet above the largest tide pool.

Directly above where Kyriakos knelt.

He could see the jar now.

Clear borosilicate glass.

Maybe six inches tall.

Positioned directly beside the baked earth circle.

Open.

Waiting.

And there.

In the water.

The Orchid.

Tiny.

Pale.

Its petals were beginning to unfurl.

Midnight was close.

Very close.

Movement drew Cornelius's attention.

The Orchid's petals opened further.

One.

Two.

Three.

The bloom was happening.

Right now.

Cornelius's heat-sense detected a change in the air.

A warmth spreading from the flower.

Chemical compounds volatilizing.

Pheromones.

The scent of the Moon-Scented Orchid.

Kyriakos noticed.

His thermal signature shifted.

Attention snapping back to the pool.

His hand reached for the jar.

Lifted it.

Positioned it directly above the blooming flower.

The pheromones would rise.

Would enter through the one-way valve.

Would be trapped inside.

Unless—

Cornelius launched.

Not a glide.

A drop.

Straight down.

He landed on the jar's cap.

His weight—all twelve pounds of it—drove the lid downward.

The threads caught.

Sealed.

Kyriakos jerked back. "What—"

Cornelius's breath weapon ignited.

Blue flame.

Concentrated.

Precise.

Aimed directly at the seal.

The lead began to heat.

"Get off that!" Kyriakos's hand shot toward him.

Zeph tackled Kyriakos from the side.

Not gracefully.

Not skillfully.

But with enough surprise and momentum to knock the satyr off balance.

They hit the ground together.

Cornelius stayed on the jar.

Wings spread for balance.

Fire focused on the seal.

The lead was warming.

Starting to soften.

Just a few more seconds.

Kyriakos shoved Zeph off. "You little—"

Sophia appeared beside them. "Evidence tampering is a serious charge, Master Vlahos."

"This is not tampering. This is my equipment. My—"

"Your equipment containing pheromones from a protected species." Sophia's voice was sharp. "Witnessed by three people. Documented. Sealed."

The lead was melting.

Cornelius could feel it through his claws.

The gasket liquefying.

Flowing into the threads.

Fusing cap to rim.

"That dragon is destroying my property!"

"That dragon," came Orestes's voice from the path above, "is preserving evidence."

The dryad-touched hermit appeared at the edge of the pools.

Still moving slowly.

Still fighting chloroform.

But present.

Witnessing.

The lead solidified.

Fused.

Permanent.

Cornelius stepped off the jar.

Extinguished his breath weapon.

His entire body ached.

His fire-glands felt depleted.

But the jar was sealed.

Truly sealed.

Forever sealed.

Kyriakos stared at it.

At the jar he had commissioned.

The jar he had designed to be unbreakable.

Now a prison for his own crime.

"You," he said quietly, "have made a significant mistake."

"No," Cornelius said. His voice was level. Controlled. "You made the mistake. Eight months ago when you stole Sophia's glaze formula. Six weeks ago when you stole Dr. Floros's journal. Tonight when you attempted to harvest a protected species."

"Attempted?" Kyriakos's smile was cold. "I succeeded. The pheromones are in the jar. Mine. Legally obtained from public land during a natural bloom event."

"Legally obtained," Sophia repeated. "Using stolen research to locate an undisclosed endangered species site. With equipment specifically designed to prevent reproduction."

"Prove the research was stolen."

Orestes moved closer. "The journal. Show them the journal, Vlahos."

Kyriakos's thermal signature shifted.

Just slightly.

But enough.

"I do not know what you—"

"Your satchel." Orestes pointed. "Brown leather. The same satchel you carried three days ago when you surveyed these pools. The same satchel currently containing Dr. Anthea Floros's personal field journal."

Silence.

Then Kyriakos reached for the satchel.

Zeph was faster.

He grabbed it first.

Held it out of reach.

"Let me see."

Kyriakos's hand shot out.

Not toward Zeph.

Toward the journal visible at the satchel's opening.

Toward evidence.

Orestes moved.

Despite the chloroform.

Despite the exhaustion.

He was still the guardian.

Still the Watcher.

His hand caught Kyriakos's wrist.

"That," Orestes said quietly, "is not yours."

For a moment no one moved.

Then Kyriakos pulled back.

"Keep it," he said. "The journal. The jar. All of it. It proves nothing."

"It proves you stole protected biological material," Sophia said.

"It proves I collected gas from a flower. A flower growing on public land. During its natural bloom." Kyriakos adjusted his robes. Composed himself. "I have broken no law."

"You broke into Dr. Floros's room," Cornelius said.

"Prove it."

"You drugged Orestes."

"Prove it."

"You set a trap that could have killed Sophia or Zeph."

"Prove it." Kyriakos's smile returned. "You have theories. Accusations. And a sealed jar containing organic compounds from a plant that bloomed naturally tonight. Nothing more."

He was right.

Partially right.

The journal proved theft of research.

The jar proved collection of pheromones.

But neither definitively proved attempted extinction.

Unless—

"The Orchid is still here," Cornelius said slowly. "Still alive. And you have

 Dr. Floros's environmental data. Data you stole specifically to transplant the bulb and create a monopoly on future blooms."

Kyriakos went still.

"If we excavate the area around the pool," Cornelius continued, "we will find evidence of disturbance. Trowel marks in the baked earth. Recent digging. Attempts to access the root system."

"Speculation."

"Physical evidence." Cornelius looked at Orestes. "The hermit witnessed you measuring these pools three days ago. Documented your presence. Can provide testimony about your stated intentions."

"The rambling of a dryad-touched stranger who attacked me without provocation."

"A guardian performing his hereditary duty." Orestes's voice was firm. "Protecting endangered species from poachers."

The pieces were assembling.

Not a complete picture.

Not yet.

But enough to prevent Kyriakos from simply walking away.

"Captain Theo will want to examine that jar," Cornelius said. "And the journal. And this site. And when he does, he will find a pattern. Theft. Trespass. Assault. Attempted extinction for profit."

Kyriakos looked at each of them in turn.

At Zeph holding the satchel.

At Sophia standing witness.

At Orestes blocking the path.

At Cornelius perched on the stone beside the sealed jar.

"This is not over," he said quietly.

Then he turned.

And walked up the tide pool path.

Toward the summit.

Away from the Orchid.

No one stopped him.

They had what they needed.

Evidence.

Witnesses.

The Orchid itself, still blooming in the pool below.

Zeph exhaled. Long and shaky. "Did that just work?"

"Partially." Cornelius looked at the sealed jar. "We saved the Orchid. We secured evidence. We prevented monopolization."

"But Kyriakos is leaving," Sophia said.

"To where?" Orestes gestured at the cliff. "The summit connects only to Solterra Bay. Where Captain Theo waits. Where the Festival witnesses wait. Where his reputation and business interests are centered."

"He will run," Zeph said.

"Perhaps." Cornelius's tail curled. "But we have time now. Time to present evidence properly. Time to coordinate with authorities. Time to—"

A sound carried across the pools.

Voices.

Multiple voices.

Coming from the summit path.

Cornelius's heat-sense caught them.

Four thermal signatures.

Humans.

In Watch uniforms.

And at their head, one very familiar warm shape.

Captain Theo.

He appeared at the path's edge.

Lantern raised.

Expression neutral.

"Master Vlahos," Theo said. "Please remain where you are."

Kyriakos stopped.

Theo descended to the pools.

Three Watch officers followed.

He looked at the assembled group.

At Cornelius.

At the jar.

At the journal in Zeph's hands.

"Explain," he said.

And Cornelius did.
