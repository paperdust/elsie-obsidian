# Chapter 18

Captain Theo stood at the edge of the tide pools with his lantern raised and his expression absolutely neutral.

That expression was worse than anger.

Worse than skepticism.

Neutral meant Theo was cataloging. Observing. Building a case in his mind before committing to any position.

Cornelius recognized the technique.

He used it himself when evaluating damaged manuscripts.

"Explain," Theo said.

And Cornelius did.

He started with the journal theft from the Sea View Guest House six days ago. Moved through the pattern of botanical research requests. The borosilicate glass fragments. The perfume scent in Dr. Floros's room.

Theo listened without interrupting.

The three Watch officers spread out around the pools. Not threatening. Just present. Creating a perimeter that Kyriakos would have to cross if he wanted to leave.

Cornelius continued.

The tide pool measurements three days ago. Orestes's confrontation with a robed figure carrying brown leather and smelling of synthetic musk. The chloroform attack. The wire trap on the path.

He kept his voice level. Factual. The same tone he used when explaining library acquisition procedures to the City Council.

Facts, not patterns.

Evidence, not assumptions.

When Cornelius finished, Theo looked at Kyriakos.

"Master Vlahos. Your response?"

Kyriakos had composed himself during the recitation. His thermal signature was controlled now. Calm. He adjusted his robes with deliberate precision.

"I came to observe a rare botanical phenomenon," he said. "As is my right on public land. I brought equipment to collect atmospheric samples for professional research. When I arrived, I found these individuals trespassing and damaging my property."

He gestured at the sealed jar.

"That dragon welded my custom glassware shut. Destroyed months of preparation. Ruined a significant financial investment."

"The jar contains pheromones from a protected species," Sophia said.

"The jar contains gas from a flower," Kyriakos corrected. "A flower that bloomed naturally. That released compounds into the air naturally. I simply collected what was already dispersing."

"Using stolen research to locate an undisclosed population," Cornelius said.

"Prove the research was stolen."

Zeph held up the satchel. "The journal has Dr. Floros's name on every page. Her handwriting. Her personal notes."

"Which I found abandoned at the guest house," Kyriakos said smoothly. "I assumed it was discarded. Took it as reference material for my botanical studies."

Lie.

Complete lie.

But delivered with such confidence that doubt flickered across one officer's face.

Theo's expression remained neutral.

"The guest house clerk will confirm no such journal was in the public areas," Cornelius said. "And Dr. Floros will identify it as her personal property. Stolen from a locked room."

"A room she claims was locked." Kyriakos's smile was cold. "The good doctor has been experiencing memory difficulties. She admitted as much. Perhaps she simply misplaced her journal and forgot."

Cornelius's scales prickled.

That was dangerously close to what Dr. Floros herself had suggested yesterday. The fear in her voice when she wondered if the theft had been her own failing mind.

Kyriakos was using her vulnerability as a weapon.

"The journal is not the only evidence," Orestes said from his position on the path. "I witnessed you surveying these pools. Measuring. Planning. Three days before tonight's bloom."

"I witnessed a hermit attack me without provocation," Kyriakos countered. "Threaten me with violence. Force me to defend myself."

"You used chloroform."

"I used a defensive compound when a stranger emerged from the rocks making threats." Kyriakos's voice took on a wounded quality. "I feared for my safety. When he collapsed, I considered summoning the Watch. But given his evident mental instability, I chose to simply leave."

Another lie.

But again, delivered with conviction.

Theo's neutral expression had not changed.

He was still cataloging.

Still evaluating.

"The wire trap," Cornelius said. "Strung across the path at ankle height. Designed to cause serious injury or death."

"What wire trap?"

"The steel wire you positioned to prevent pursuit. We found it on the approach path."

"Then someone else placed it." Kyriakos spread his hands. "Perhaps the hermit, attempting to protect what he views as his territory. Perhaps vandals. The cliffs are public access. Anyone could have placed a wire."

He was good.

Better than Cornelius had anticipated.

Every accusation met with a plausible alternative explanation.

No direct admissions.

No confirmable details.

Just enough truth mixed with lies to create reasonable doubt.

Theo looked at Sophia. "You are the glasswork expert?"

"Yes, Captain. Sophia Doukas. House Doukas guild." She straightened slightly. "I commissioned and fabricated that jar to Master Vlahos's specifications eight months ago."

"For what stated purpose?"

"Capturing volatile aromatic compounds for perfume development." Sophia's voice was steady. "But the design he requested was excessive for standard atmospheric collection. The lead gasket. The reinforced rim. The one-way valve. Those features suggest he intended to trap something permanently. Something he never wanted released."

"Professional opinion," Kyriakos said. "Not evidence."

"The jar is sealed now," Theo observed. "Can it be opened?"

Cornelius shook his head. "The lead gasket is fused. Melted into the threads. Opening it would require destroying the jar completely."

"Which means the contents cannot be verified."

"The contents can be verified," Sophia said. "With proper analysis. Pheromone compounds are identifiable. Unique chemical signatures. A laboratory could confirm the gas inside matches the Moon-Scented Orchid."

"Could confirm," Kyriakos repeated. "Might confirm. Possibly confirm. But cannot confirm definitively without opening the jar. Which you admit is impossible without destruction." He looked at Theo. "Captain, I believe we have strayed from productive discussion into speculation."

Theo's jaw tightened slightly.

The first crack in his neutral facade.

"Master Vlahos, you will accompany me to the Watch station. For formal questioning."

"Am I being charged?"

"You are being questioned. As are these others." Theo gestured at Cornelius, Zeph, Sophia, and Orestes. "All of you will provide formal statements. Tonight."

"I am happy to cooperate," Kyriakos said. "Though I must note I am an invited Festival merchant. My reputation in this city is considerable. Any suggestion of impropriety could damage significant business relationships."

Translation: I have influence. Be careful how you proceed.

Theo's expression hardened further.

"Noted. Officer Dimitris, please escort Master Vlahos to the station. Separate interview room."

One of the Watch officers moved to Kyriakos's side.

Not touching.

Not restraining.

But present.

Kyriakos inclined his head slightly. "Of course, Captain. Though I believe you will find this entire incident was a misunderstanding. Resolved easily with clear communication."

He walked toward the path.

Stopped.

Turned back to look at the Orchid.

"Beautiful flower," he said quietly. "Truly extraordinary. Pity it blooms so rarely. One wonders how much longer the species can sustain itself with such limited reproductive opportunities."

Threat.

Barely veiled.

He was suggesting he might return.

Might finish what he started.

Might ensure the Orchid never bloomed again.

Cornelius's claws scraped stone.

But Kyriakos was already walking away. Following Officer Dimitris up the path toward the summit.

His thermal signature was calm.

Confident.

He believed he had won.

Believed his story would hold.

Believed wealth and reputation would insulate him from consequences.

Theo watched him go. Then turned to Cornelius.

"Your formal statement. Watch station. One hour."

"Understood."

"And Cornelius." Theo's voice dropped. "That jar is evidence now. You do not touch it. You do not move it. You do not investigate it further. Am I clear?"

"Perfectly clear."

"Good." Theo looked at the remaining officers. "Secure this site. No one approaches the pools until I return with proper documentation equipment."

He started up the path.

Stopped.

Looked back at the Orchid.

Its pale petals were fully open now. Tiny. Luminous. Releasing pheromones into the night air that only specialized equipment could capture.

Or specialized noses could detect.

Cornelius's heat-sense caught a new thermal signature.

Small.

Winged.

Approaching from the ocean.

A moth.

Large for its species. Maybe four inches across. Wings that reflected moonlight with an opalescent sheen.

The Moon-Moth.

The Orchid's pollinator.

It landed on the pool's edge. Antennae quivering. Following the pheromone trail to the flower.

Theo watched it for a long moment.

Then continued up the path without comment.

The remaining officers positioned themselves at intervals along the route. Creating a perimeter. Ensuring no one disturbed the site before official documentation.

Cornelius moved to the pool's edge.

The Moon-Moth had reached the Orchid. Its proboscis extended. Drinking nectar. Brushing against the flower's reproductive structures.

Pollinating.

Completing the cycle the Orchid had waited fifty years to attempt.

Ensuring another generation.

Perhaps.

If the seeds found proper habitat.

If conditions remained stable.

If no one disturbed the bulb during its dormant decades.

So many variables.

So much fragility.

Sophia sat down heavily on the stone beside him. "We did it."

"Partially."

"We saved the Orchid. We trapped the evidence. We stopped Kyriakos from monopolizing the species." She looked at him. "That is not partial. That is success."

"Kyriakos walks free."

"For now." Sophia's voice was firm. "But we have the journal. We have the jar. We have Orestes's testimony. And we have you."

"Me?"

"Your investigation. Your documentation. Your meticulous record-keeping." She smiled slightly. "The same obsessive organization that drives Zeph insane just became our strongest asset. Because you can reconstruct the entire timeline. Cross-reference every detail. Build a case that even Kyriakos's lawyers cannot dismantle."

Zeph appeared beside them. His wrapped hands were soaked through with blood. His clothes were torn. His face was exhausted.

But he was grinning.

"Did you see that moth?" he asked.

"I saw it."

"Biggest moth I have ever seen. Just. Flew right up to the weirdest flower in the ocean and started making moth-babies."

"That is not how pollination—" Cornelius stopped. "Yes. Essentially."

"We saved moth-babies."

"We saved potential genetic diversity for an endangered species."

"Same thing." Zeph sat down beside Sophia. "Boss, I just want to confirm something."

"What?"

"We are never climbing that cliff again. Right?"

"Correct."

"Good. Because I am fairly certain I left pieces of my hands on the limestone."

Sophia took his wrist gently. Examined the wrapped palms. "We need to get these properly cleaned."

"After the formal statement."

"Before the formal statement. You are not giving testimony while bleeding through bandages." She stood. "Come on. The Watch officers have medical supplies."

Zeph followed her.

Leaving Cornelius alone with Orestes.

The dryad-touched hermit settled onto a flat stone. His movements were still slow. Still impaired by the chloroform.

But improving.

"You did well, Lizard."

"Cornelius."

"Cornelius." Orestes's correction was almost respectful. "You honored your word. Protected the living truth. Even when it required getting your claws dirty."

Cornelius looked at his claws.

They were dirty.

Streaked with limestone dust. Salt residue. The grime that accumulated from climbing vertical surfaces and crawling through narrow spaces.

Unacceptable.

He would need to clean them thoroughly back at the library.

Organize his scales.

Polish his spectacles properly.

Restore order.

But that could wait.

"The Orchid is pollinated," Cornelius said.

"Yes."

"The jar is sealed."

"Yes."

"Kyriakos is contained."

"For now."

Cornelius's tail curled. "You believe he will return."

"I believe he is a gardener who sees beauty as property." Orestes looked at the Orchid. At the Moon-Moth still working among the petals. "Such men always return. They cannot help themselves."

"Then we will be ready."

"We?"

"You. Me. Zeph. Sophia." Cornelius's claws gripped stone. "Captain Theo. The Watch. The entire city if necessary."

Orestes was quiet for a long moment.

Then: "You have changed, Hoarder of Dead Words."

"My name is—"

"I know your name." Orestes's smile was faint. "But you have changed nonetheless. When you first climbed to my alcove, you sought a book. Now you protect a flower."

"I protect both."

"Yes. You do." Orestes stood. Moved to the pool's edge. "The Watcher acknowledges the Hoarder's guardianship. The living truth and the pressed truth shall share protection."

It sounded formal.

Almost ceremonial.

Cornelius was not certain how to respond to that.

"Thank you?" he tried.

"You are welcome, Cornelius Drake." Orestes pronounced the full name carefully. "Now go. Give your testimony. Build your case. Restore your city's order."

"What will you do?"

"Watch. As I have always done." Orestes looked at the Orchid. "And ensure this flower lives its full night. Dies its natural death. Returns to the stone until the next moon calls it forth."

Fifty years.

The Orchid would sleep for fifty years before blooming again.

Cornelius would be eighty-seven by then.

Ancient for a Library Dragon.

Perhaps too old to climb cliffs in darkness.

Perhaps too old to chase perfumers through Festival crowds.

But if he was alive.

If he was still cataloging.

Still organizing.

Still protecting.

He would return to this pool.

Would verify the Orchid's survival.

Would ensure no false gardeners had harvested its future.

"I will watch with you," Cornelius said.

"In fifty years?"

"In fifty years."

Orestes's smile widened slightly. "Then I shall save you a stone, Hoarder. One with a good view."

Cornelius left him there.

Climbed the path toward the summit.

His entire body ached.

His claws burned.

His wings trembled with exhaustion.

His fire-glands felt depleted. Empty. The reservoir that fueled his breath weapon reduced to the barest reserves.

But he had sealed the jar.

Had trapped the evidence.

Had saved the Orchid.

Had honored Dr. Floros's research.

Had proven Captain Theo wrong about draconic melodrama.

Had demonstrated that precise application of a small flame could achieve what brute force could not.

The Hunt was over.

The prey was contained.

Order had been restored.

Mostly.

The formal statements would take hours.

The investigation would take weeks.

The legal proceedings might take months.

But the center held.

The Orchid bloomed.

The evidence was secured.

The team had succeeded.

Together.

Not alone.

Together.

Cornelius reached the summit and looked back.

The tide pools were barely visible from this height. The Orchid was invisible. 

But Orestes's thermal signature was clear. Seated on his stone. Watching.

Keeping faith with a fifty-year cycle that had outlasted empires.

Sophia and Zeph were halfway up the path. Moving slowly. Supporting each other.

The Watch officers maintained their perimeter.

And somewhere ahead, Captain Theo waited with forms and questions and the bureaucratic machinery that would transform tonight's chaos into documented order.

Cornelius's scales settled.

His tail uncurled.

His breath weapon flickered once. Faint. Almost depleted.

But ready.

Always ready.

He spread his wings.

Not for flight.

Just to feel the air move across membrane and bone.

To remind himself he was a dragon.

Small.

Precise.

But still a dragon.

Hoarder of dead words.

Guardian of living truths.

Protector of both.

Then he folded his wings.

And walked toward the Watch station.

Toward forms and statements and proper procedure.

Toward order.

The moon watched from above.

Full.

Perfect.

Marking the exact moment when a flower bloomed.

When gas was trapped.

When evidence was sealed.

When chaos became glass.

Permanent.

Unbreakable.

Forever.
