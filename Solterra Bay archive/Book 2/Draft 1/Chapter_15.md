# Chapter 15

"Wait." Sophia's hand shot out, stopping Cornelius mid-step. "Wait. Something is wrong."

Cornelius froze. His claws gripped the alcove's limestone edge. Below, Zeph and Orestes were approaching along the coastal path, their thermal signatures bright against the cold stone.

"What?" Cornelius asked.

Sophia was staring at the glass shard in her palm. The fragment caught beetle-light, throwing tiny reflections across her fingers.

"The jar," she said slowly. "He commissioned it for 'capturing volatile aromatic compounds.'" Her voice changed. Sharpened. "That was the exact phrase he used. Volatile aromatic compounds."

"Yes. The Orchid's pheromones." Cornelius's tail curled impatiently. They had forty-eight minutes. Every second spent talking was a second closer to midnight. "We established—"

"No." Sophia turned the shard over. "Pheromones are gases. They disperse. Even if he captured them in this jar, they would degrade within hours. Days at most. You cannot bottle a scent that way. Not permanently."

Cornelius went still.

Actually still.

The kind of predatory stillness that happened when his mind caught something important.

"Perfumes are made from extracted oils," Sophia continued. Her words came faster now. Urgent. "Essential oils. Concentrated compounds that you dilute into alcohol or carrier substances. You cannot make a perfume from air. You need biological matter. Plant tissue."

"He could press the petals," Cornelius said. But even as he spoke, his mind was already moving ahead. Already seeing the problem. "Extract the oils after the bloom."

"The Orchid blooms for one night." Sophia's knuckles were white around the glass shard. "One night every fifty years. Even if he pressed every petal immediately, the yield would be minuscule. A few drops at most. Not enough for a commercial perfume. Not enough for the 'ultimate luxury' Orestes described."

Cornelius's scales prickled cold.

"Unless," he said quietly, "he takes the entire plant."

Sophia nodded. "Unless he takes the bulb."

The words hung in the air between them.

Below, Zeph and Orestes reached the base of the cliff. Their voices drifted up, too quiet to distinguish words. Just the sound of humans navigating stone in darkness.

"That is why he needed the journal," Cornelius said. His mind was cataloging implications with terrible speed. "Not for the map. He knew where the Orchid was. Orestes said the False Gardener had been here before. Watching. Waiting."

"Then why steal it?" Sophia asked. "If he already knew the location—"

"Because location is insufficient for transplantation." Cornelius's claws scraped against limestone. "Dr. Floros's journal contains fifty years of botanical field research. Including—" His breath caught. "Including the specific environmental conditions required to keep rare coastal specimens alive."

"Soil composition," Sophia said. "Fungal symbiosis. Mycorrhizal relationships."

"Yes." Cornelius's tail lashed once. Hard. "The Orchid grows here because of something in this specific location. The limestone. The ocean spray. The particular blend of minerals and microorganisms in the tide pool soil. Dr. Floros would have documented all of it. Studied it. Recorded the exact conditions."

"So Kyriakos could recreate them." Sophia's voice was flat. Furious. "In a greenhouse. In a controlled environment where he owns the only living specimen."

"And harvests it on his own schedule," Cornelius finished. "Every fifty years. Forever. A renewable source of the rarest perfume ingredient in existence."

The implications assembled like a perfectly organized catalog.

Kyriakos was not planning to smother the bloom.

He was planning to steal the future.

All of it.

Every bloom for the next thousand years.

"That is why he brought laboratory equipment," Cornelius said. His voice sounded distant to his own ears. Analytical. The tone he used when examining particularly damaged manuscripts. "Not just the collection jar. He would need tools for excavating the bulb. Soil sample containers. Perhaps even portable cold storage to keep the mycorrhizal fungi viable during transport."

"He has been planning this for months," Sophia said. "Since before he commissioned the jar. Since—" She stopped. Her thermal signature flared hotter. "Since he stole my family's glaze formula."

Cornelius looked at her.

"The theft," Sophia continued, her words clipped and precise, "happened eight months ago. Right after the University of Khariton published a paper about rare coastal flora. My mother mentioned it. Said a wealthy client had become very interested in botanical preservation techniques."

"Kyriakos."

"Kyriakos." Sophia's hand tightened on the glass shard. "He started researching immediately. Found out about the Orchid. About Dr. Floros's work. And then he began acquiring everything he needed. My glaze formula for specialized ceramics. Laboratory glass from my guild. Access to academic archives." Her voice dropped. "Probably bribes. Probably more thefts we do not even know about yet."

"All leading to tonight," Cornelius said.

"All leading to tonight."

Zeph's voice drifted up from below. "Boss? You still up there?"

Cornelius moved to the alcove edge. "We are here."

"Good. Orestes is—" Zeph stopped talking. Started again. "Orestes is not doing great. The chloroform is still messing with his balance. We need to move soon or he is going to collapse."

Cornelius looked at Sophia. "We need to revise the plan."

"Why?" Sophia asked. "If he is taking the bulb instead of just the scent, does that change—"

"Everything," Cornelius interrupted. "It changes everything."

He moved back from the edge, giving himself space to think.

The original plan had been simple. Elegant. Approach from above. Shatter the collection jar with dragon fire. Release the pheromones. Let the Moon-Moth find the Orchid naturally.

But if Kyriakos was excavating the bulb—

"He will not be watching the bloom," Cornelius said. "He will be digging."

"Which means he is not positioned by the largest pool like Orestes said." Sophia's eyes widened. "He moved. He is wherever the Orchid actually grows."

"And we do not know where that is." Cornelius's tail lashed again. "The journal had maps. Detailed drawings. But I never saw them. Never studied them. I only know the Orchid is somewhere in the tide pools. That could be anywhere within a hundred-foot radius."

"Orestes knows," Sophia said. "He is the guardian. He would know exactly—"

"Orestes can barely walk," Cornelius countered. "And even if he could guide us from the alcove, we would need to search the pools systematically. In darkness. While Kyriakos digs up a fifty-year-old bulb."

The timeline was collapsing.

They had forty-five minutes until midnight.

Maybe less.

And they were still at the top of the cliff with no clear path to the Orchid and no way to know if they could reach it before Kyriakos finished his excavation.

"We need more people," Sophia said. "Captain Theo. The Watch. We should—"

"No." The word came out sharper than Cornelius intended. "Theo will not believe me. Not after this morning. Not after Brother Demos. And even if he did, gathering Watch officers and reaching the pools would take—" He calculated quickly. "Ninety minutes. Perhaps more given the Festival crowds."

"Then what?" Sophia's frustration matched his own. "We just let him take it?"

Cornelius's claws scraped against stone.

No.

No, he would not let Kyriakos take it.

Would not let a collector steal fifty years of Dr. Floros's work and use it to cage a species for profit.

Would not let beauty be reduced to possession.

There had to be a way.

Some route. Some approach. Some—

The rooftops.

The thought arrived fully formed.

Cornelius's heat-sense had mapped Solterra Bay from above dozens of times. Hundreds of times. He knew every thermal vent. Every chimney. Every gap between buildings where the warmth from human habitation created updrafts.

He knew the Dragon's Route.

"The coastal path is blocked by Festival crowds," Cornelius said slowly. His mind was already tracing the route. Already calculating distances and wind patterns. "But the rooftops are empty."

Sophia stared at him. "The rooftops."

"I can fly along the ridgeline. Above the market. Above the crowds." Cornelius's wings spread slightly, testing the concept. "The wind is strong but manageable at that altitude. And from the old customs house roof, there is a direct line to Widow's Perch."

"How direct?" Sophia asked.

"Two hundred feet. Mostly vertical. But climbable."

"Climbable for a dragon," Sophia said. "Not for humans."

"No." Cornelius looked at her. "You and Orestes take the coastal path. Move as quickly as Orestes can manage. You will arrive later than me, but you will arrive."

"And what will you do when you get there alone?" Sophia's voice carried the same sharp edge she used when discussing stolen glaze formulas. "Kyriakos has chloroform. Laboratory tools. He has already proven he will drug or restrain anyone who interferes. You are the size of a large cat. He could—"

"I will not engage him directly," Cornelius said. The plan was forming with crystalline clarity now. The kind of perfect organizational structure he usually reserved for alphabetization schemes. "I will locate the Orchid. Verify its position. And then—" He paused. "Then I will prevent the excavation."

"How?"

"I breathe fire."

Sophia's expression shifted. "You would burn it?"

"No. I would make it impossible to dig." Cornelius's tail curled and uncurled as he worked through the specifics. "Bulbs grow in soil. Soil mixed with organic matter and fungal networks. If I apply sufficient heat to the surrounding substrate, I can fuse the top layer. Create a hardened crust. Like pottery in a kiln."

"You would bake the soil," Sophia said slowly. "Seal the bulb underground."

"Temporarily. Until you and Orestes arrive. Until we can coordinate a proper defense." Cornelius looked toward the Festival lights below. "It will not be permanent. But it will buy us time. Force Kyriakos to either abandon the attempt or commit to a much longer excavation. Hours instead of minutes."

"And if he has tools that can break through baked earth?"

"Then I improvise." Cornelius met her eyes. "But the alternative is letting him take the bulb. Now. Tonight. Without any resistance at all."

Sophia was quiet for a long moment.

Then she nodded. "Go."

Cornelius moved to the alcove edge. "Zeph!" he called down. "I am going ahead. Take Orestes along the coastal path. Move as fast as you can."

"What?" Zeph's thermal signature shifted in confusion. "Why? What happened?"

"Kyriakos is taking the whole bulb. We need to reach him before he finishes digging it up."

"Then we should all—"

"The crowds block the main path. I am taking the rooftops."

Silence from below.

Then: "Boss. The rooftops are twenty feet above the market. With no railings. In darkness. During a windstorm."

"I am aware."

"You are going to kill yourself."

"I am going to save the Orchid," Cornelius corrected. "You are going to escort Orestes safely to the tide pools and arrive in time to help Sophia disable any equipment Kyriakos might have already positioned."

More silence.

Then Zeph said something that sounded very much like a creative application of nautical terminology.

"Your objection is noted," Cornelius said. "Now move. We have forty-three minutes."

He turned back to Sophia. "When you reach the pools, look for hardened soil. That is where I will be. Where the Orchid grows."

"Understood." Sophia straightened. Squared her shoulders. "Cornelius?"

"Yes?"

"Do not die on the rooftops. Zeph would never forgive you."

"I have no intention of dying anywhere."

"Good."

Sophia disappeared over the alcove edge, descending to join Zeph and Orestes.

Cornelius was alone.

He spread his wings fully. Felt the wind try to catch the membrane. Felt the familiar resistance of air against scale.

The Dragon's Route.

He had flown it in daylight. In calm weather. With full visibility and no time pressure.

This was none of those things.

This was darkness. Beetle-light. Gale-force wind. And a ticking clock.

Cornelius launched.

The wind hit him immediately. Tried to shove him toward the ocean. His wings compensated, angling hard. The cliff face blurred past.

Down.

Too fast.

His heat-sense mapped the buildings below. The market. The tavern. The customs house with its flat roof and—

There.

A thermal vent. Warm air rising from a bakery chimney.

Cornelius angled into the updraft. The warm air caught his wings. Lifted him.

He climbed.

Ten feet.

Twenty.

The rooftops appeared below. Terra-cotta tiles slick with ocean spray. Gaps between buildings where festival-goers moved like warm shadows.

Cornelius leveled out. His wings found the rhythm. Stroke. Glide. Stroke. Glide.

The route unfolded in his mind with perfect clarity.

First: the tavern roof. Thirty feet ahead. Flat section with a chimney providing updraft.

Then: the guild hall. Fifty feet beyond that. Peaked roof requiring a brief climb.

Finally: the customs house. The launching point for Widow's Perch.

Cornelius flew.

The wind fought him. The darkness made navigation dependent entirely on heat-sense. But he had done this before.

Different circumstances.

Same route.

Same city.

His city.

The tavern roof appeared. Cornelius landed. His claws found purchase on tiles still warm from the day's retained heat.

He did not stop.

Launched again immediately. Toward the guild hall.

The peaked roof required actual climbing. His claws dug into terra-cotta. His wings folded tight against his sides. The wind tried to peel him off the tiles.

He reached the peak. Balanced there for one heartbeat.

Then descended the far side in a controlled glide.

The customs house waited fifty feet ahead.

Cornelius's wings beat harder. The wind was stronger here. Less predictable. The beetle swarms created pockets of disturbed air that made every stroke uncertain.

His heat-sense found the customs house roof.

Flat.

Empty.

Perfect.

Cornelius landed hard. Too hard. His claws scraped across stone. His tail whipped for balance.

He caught himself.

Stood.

And looked up.

Widow's Perch rose two hundred feet above the customs house. A vertical limestone wall broken by occasional ledges and outcroppings.

Climbable.

Barely.

Cornelius's wings folded against his sides. His claws extended fully. His tail positioned for counterbalance.

This was not flight.

This was climbing.

He started up.

The limestone was rough. Full of handholds. But slick with spray and darkness made each grip uncertain.

Fifty feet.

One hundred feet.

His wings ached from being held so tightly folded. His claws burned from gripping cold stone.

One hundred fifty feet.

The wind was murderous at this height. It tried to shove him off the cliff face. Tried to peel his claws from their holds.

Cornelius climbed.

One hundred seventy-five feet.

Almost there.

His heat-sense detected the alcove above. The same alcove where Orestes had been drugged. Where Sophia had waited while Cornelius descended to scout the wire trap.

Twenty feet remained.

Fifteen.

Ten.

Cornelius's claw found the alcove edge. He pulled himself up. Rolled onto flat stone.

For a moment he just lay there. Breathing hard. Wings trembling slightly from exertion.

Then he stood.

The tide pools spread below. Dark shapes against darker water. The moon reflected off their surfaces in silver fragments.

Somewhere down there, Kyriakos was digging.

Cornelius's heat-sense swept the area.

There.

A warm thermal signature. Human-sized. Kneeling beside the furthest pool.

Not moving.

Completely still.

Wrong.

That was wrong.

Kyriakos should be digging. Moving. Working frantically against the midnight deadline.

But the signature was motionless.

Waiting.

Cornelius's scales prickled.

This was a trap.

Kyriakos knew someone was coming.

Had prepared for interference.

Had positioned himself exactly where he could watch all approaches while appearing to be focused on the pools.

Cornelius crept to the alcove edge.

The path down was still there. Still trapped with the wire Orestes had warned about.

But there was another route.

A route only a dragon could take.

Cornelius spread his wings.

Then folded them again.

No.

Not yet.

He needed more information.

Needed to verify the Orchid's exact location before committing to a descent.

His heat-sense focused on the pools.

The thermal signature by the furthest pool was definitely Kyriakos. The physiology matched. Satyr-kin. Slightly warmer baseline than human.

But where was the Orchid?

Cornelius's eyes adjusted to the beetle-light. The pools appeared as dark crescents. Five of them. Ranging from ten feet across to barely three feet wide.

Which one held the Orchid?

His memory supplied Orestes's earlier description: "The largest pool."

But from this angle, in this light, Cornelius could not determine which pool was largest.

He needed to get closer.

Needed to—

Movement below.

The thermal signature shifted. Stood.

Kyriakos was moving.

Walking.

Not toward the pools.

Toward the path.

Walking directly toward where Zeph and Orestes would arrive.

Cornelius's breath weapon flickered at the back of his throat.

No.

He launched from the alcove.

Not a controlled glide.

A dive.

Straight down toward the tide pools with wings folded and claws extended.

The wind screamed past his scales.

The pools rushed up to meet him.

Thirty feet.

Twenty.

Ten.

Cornelius's wings snapped open.

The air caught them. Jerked him violently horizontal. His shoulder joints screamed in protest.

Five feet above the largest pool, Cornelius's wings beat hard. Once. Twice.

He landed on the pool's edge.

On stone slick with spray and algae.

His claws scrabbled for purchase.

Found it.

He crouched there. Wings spread for balance. Heat-sense sweeping the area.

Kyriakos was fifty feet away. Moving steadily toward the path. Toward Zeph and Orestes.

Which meant—

Cornelius looked down.

At the pool.

At the dark water reflecting beetle-light and moon.

And there.

Just visible below the surface.

Growing from a crack in the submerged limestone.

A plant.

Pale. Delicate. With leaves that seemed to glow faintly in the darkness.

The Moon-Scented Orchid.

It was tiny.

The whole plant barely eight inches tall.

Cornelius had expected something dramatic. Showy. Befitting a once-in-fifty-years bloom.

But the Orchid was small.

Almost invisible.

Unless you knew exactly where to look.

And Kyriakos knew.

Had studied Dr. Floros's journal.

Had memorized the maps.

Had come here prepared.

Cornelius's claws gripped the stone.

His breath weapon flickered ready.

He looked at the soil surrounding the pool.

Dark.

Organic.

Rich with the specific fungal networks Dr. Floros had documented.

The soil Kyriakos needed to keep the bulb alive after transplantation.

Cornelius took a breath.

Aimed carefully.

And breathed fire.

The tiny blue flame touched the soil.

And the Orchid's fate shifted from theft to siege.
