# Chapter 12

The Festival was loud.

Aggressively, persistently, unnecessarily loud.

Cornelius perched on the stone shoulder of Saint Kyria's statue in Harbor Square and resisted the urge to retreat to his library immediately. The marble saint stood twelve feet tall, her arms outstretched in eternal blessing over the crowds below. Her left shoulder provided an excellent vantage point and kept him safely above the chaos.

This was a terrible idea.

Below, the Festival grounds teemed with bodies—human, satyr, orc, elf, all pressed together in violation of reasonable personal space protocols. Music tangled from three different sources: a string quartet near the VIP pavilion, drums by the fountain, and something involving bells and possibly enthusiastic cats near the food stalls.

The Twinkle Nights beetles had arrived in force. Thousands of them filled the air, their bioluminescent abdomens pulsing with soft blue-green light. The "Lights Out" policy was in full effect—no lanterns, no torches, no enchanted streetlamps. Just the beetles and the specific ceremonial lanterns waiting to be lit at the stroke of ten bells.

The effect was admittedly striking. The insects moved in waves, creating patterns of light and shadow that shifted across the crowd like water. Their glow reflected off the polished tiles of the square, turning the ground into a constellation map.

Beautiful.

Also disorienting.

Also very far from the ordered silence of his library.

Cornelius's claws gripped the statue's shoulder. His tail wrapped twice around Saint Kyria's stone neck for stability. He had polished his scales. Cleaned his spectacles. Made himself presentable for exactly this: standing guard while his assistant courted a tile artist.

Being a "wingman."

Whatever that meant.

His heat-sense tracked Zeph thirty feet below, standing near the fountain with Sophia Doukas. The boy had managed to locate shoes. His shirt faced the correct direction. His hair remained chaotic, but Sophia did not seem to mind.

In fact, she was laughing.

Actually laughing—not the polite social laughter Cornelius had observed during their first meeting. This was genuine. Her thermal signature registered the elevated heart rate and increased circulation consistent with happiness.

Zeph said something Cornelius could not hear over the music and crowd noise. Sophia's hand touched his arm. Her fingers lingered there.

Good.

That was good.

Cornelius's job was to ensure Zeph did not catastrophically embarrass himself. So far, the boy was exceeding expectations.

Which meant Cornelius could focus on being miserable in public.

A burst of music from the string quartet made him wince. The notes tangled with the drums, creating auditory chaos that set his scales itching. How did humans tolerate this? The noise. The crowds. The complete absence of organization.

The Festival grounds sprawled across Harbor Square in a pattern that defied logic. Food stalls clustered near the fountain, forcing foot traffic to bottleneck. The VIP pavilion occupied the prime viewing area for the lantern lighting, blocking visibility for anyone of reasonable height who could not afford expensive seating. Beetle-watchers gathered in random clumps rather than orderly rows.

No system.

No structure.

Just chaos illuminated by insects.

Cornelius checked the position of the moon through the gaps in the beetle swarm. Quarter past nine bells. Forty-five minutes until the ceremonial lighting.

He could endure forty-five minutes.

He had endured worse.

This morning's humiliation, for instance.

The memory surfaced unbidden: the reading room. Captain Theo's cold dismissal. Dr. Floros's devastated expression when the "recovered journal" turned out to be a library book. Imelda's quiet disappointment.

His certainty crumbling like cheap parchment.

Cornelius's claws tightened on the stone.

No.

He was not thinking about that now.

He was here for Zeph. That was the mission. Watch his assistant navigate social complexity. Ensure minimal disaster. Perhaps offer tactical advice if—

Below, Sophia laughed again. She had moved closer to Zeph. Their shoulders touched.

Tactical advice appeared unnecessary.

The beetles swirled overhead in a particularly dense formation, casting the square into brief shadow before dispersing. The crowd made appreciative sounds. Someone near the food stalls dropped a plate. The resulting crash made Cornelius's scales prickle.

He forced his attention across the square, scanning for potential threats.

Not investigative threats.

Social threats.

The kind that might interrupt Zeph's progress.

The VIP pavilion glowed with enchanted beetle-lanterns—apparently wealthy patrons were exempt from the "Lights Out" policy. Silk banners hung from the pavilion's posts, displaying the crests of Solterra Bay's merchant families. Tables laden with wine and delicacies crowded the space.

Cornelius's heat-sense identified the thermal signatures inside: expensive clothing, elevated temperatures from wine consumption, the distinctive cool signature of elf physiology.

Imelda was there. He recognized her thermal pattern.

She had not acknowledged him when he arrived at the Festival. Had not even looked in his direction.

Still disappointed, then.

Fair.

He had earned her disappointment.

Cornelius pulled his attention away from the pavilion and scanned the rest of the square. Harbor Master's staff clustered near the fountain's north edge, their uniforms making them easy to identify. A group of temple monks stood by the beetle-watching platform, their gray robes dark against the insect glow.

Brother Demos was among them.

Cornelius's tail twitched.

The monk appeared recovered from this morning's public accusation. He was speaking with Sister Photine, gesturing toward the beetle swarm with academic enthusiasm.

Good.

That was... good.

Brother Demos deserved to enjoy the Festival without his false accuser lurking nearby.

Cornelius shifted his weight on Saint Kyria's shoulder and checked on Zeph again.

The boy had produced something from his pocket. A small object wrapped in cloth. He handed it to Sophia with visible nervousness.

She unwrapped it carefully.

Her thermal signature spiked—surprise, then pleasure.

Whatever the gift was, she approved.

Excellent.

Zeph was handling this without assistance.

Which meant Cornelius's presence was largely decorative.

He was a gargoyle.

A very uncomfortable gargoyle with an excellent view of other people enjoying themselves.

The music shifted. The string quartet began something slower. Couples near the fountain moved closer together, swaying to the rhythm.

Sophia took Zeph's hand.

Oh.

They were dancing.

Sort of.

Zeph's movement could not technically be classified as dancing. It was more... rhythmic shuffling. But Sophia did not seem to mind. She was smiling. Guiding him through the motions.

Her hand rested on his shoulder. His hand hovered uncertainly at her waist.

They would be fine.

Cornelius could leave.

Should leave, probably.

Retreat to the library. Return to his paperclip counting. Stop pretending he had anything useful to contribute to—

Movement in the VIP pavilion caught his attention.

Not movement, exactly.

Absence of movement.

Cornelius's heat-sense swept the pavilion again, cataloging the signatures present. Imelda. Harbor Master Philippos. Several merchant family heads. Two visiting scholars he vaguely recognized.

Someone was missing.

He focused, filtering through the thermal patterns more carefully.

Kyriakos Vlahos was not in the VIP pavilion.

Cornelius's scales prickled.

That was wrong.

Kyriakos was a celebrity perfumer. A wealthy visitor during Solterra Bay's premier Festival event. He should be in the VIP section, networking with potential clients, showcasing his presence.

But he was not there.

Cornelius scanned the crowd below, searching for the distinctive thermal signature he had memorized during their interview. Satyr-kin ran slightly warmer than baseline human. Kyriakos also wore expensive clothing that would show clear heat retention patterns.

Nothing near the fountain.

Nothing by the food stalls.

Nothing in the general Festival crowd.

Cornelius's frustration built. The beetles obscured visibility. The crowd was too dense. He needed—

There.

At the far edge of Harbor Square, where the cobblestones gave way to the coastal path.

A thermal signature moving away from the Festival. Heading northwest.

Toward the cliffs.

Cornelius focused his heat-sense, narrowing his attention to that single figure.

Satyr-kin physiology. Male. Moving with purpose rather than casual strolling.

The clothing registered wrong, though. Not expensive fabric. Not the silk and velvet Kyriakos had worn during their previous encounters.

Rough cloth. Work clothing.

And a satchel.

Brown leather, based on how the heat distributed across the bag's surface.

Cornelius's breath caught.

The figure paused at the edge of the square, glancing back toward the Festival crowds. The beetle-light caught his face for just a moment.

Kyriakos Vlahos.

Wearing rough clothing. Carrying a satchel. Heading away from the Festival toward Widow's Perch.

Toward the tide pools.

Toward the Moon-Scented Orchid.

The pieces assembled in Cornelius's mind with terrible clarity.

Orestes had warned him. "The False Gardener will come when the Orchid blooms."

Tonight was the bloom.

Full moon. Low tide.

And Kyriakos was moving toward the cliffs dressed for fieldwork, not Festival attendance.

Not attending the social event where his presence would be expected.

Because he had other plans.

Cornelius's earlier investigation crashed through his memory. The perfume in Dr. Floros's room. The borosilicate glass fragments. Kyriakos's history of stealing proprietary knowledge—Sophia's family glaze formula, and now botanical research.

He had dismissed Kyriakos.

Marked him off the suspect list because the perfumer had an alibi and the scent was "too common" to be probative.

But what if Kyriakos had not stolen the journal himself?

What if he had hired someone?

What if Brother Demos was not the thief, but someone else—someone wearing monk's robes as disguise—had taken the journal and delivered it to Kyriakos?

What if Cornelius had been investigating the wrong direction entirely?

The False Gardener.

Not a scholar seeking knowledge.

A collector seeking possession.

Someone who would bottle the Moon-Scented Orchid. Harvest it. Own it.

Exactly what Orestes had warned against.

Cornelius's claws scraped against stone.

Kyriakos was heading for the Orchid right now.

Dr. Floros was gone—departed on the evening ferry, believing her life's work was lost.

Orestes would try to stop Kyriakos, but the hermit was one aging dryad-touched human against a wealthy collector who had demonstrated willingness to steal and exploit.

Someone needed to intervene.

Someone needed to—

Below, near the fountain, Sophia rose on her toes and kissed Zeph.

Brief. Soft. The kind of first kiss that made Zeph's thermal signature spike with shock and delight.

When they separated, both were smiling.

Zeph looked happy.

Actually, genuinely happy in a way Cornelius had rarely seen.

And Cornelius was about to abandon him at the Festival to chase a suspect based on another pattern.

Another theory.

Another certainty that might be completely wrong.

He had promised to be Zeph's wingman.

Had agreed to stand nearby. Be present. Ensure minimal disaster.

But Kyriakos was getting away.

The Orchid was in danger.

And Cornelius was the only one who knew.

He checked Zeph's position again. The boy was holding Sophia's hand. They were talking. Laughing. Moving toward the lantern-lighting platform where the ceremony would begin soon.

Zeph was fine.

Better than fine.

He did not need Cornelius anymore.

Not for this.

But the Orchid—

The Moon-Scented Orchid that bloomed once every fifty years.

Dr. Floros's life work.

The living truth Orestes protected.

That needed someone.

Cornelius's wings shifted against his sides. His tail unwound from Saint Kyria's neck.

This was a terrible idea.

He had been wrong before. Wrong about Brother Demos. Wrong about the journal's location. Wrong about everything.

What if he was wrong now?

What if Kyriakos was simply taking a walk? Heading home via the coastal path? Dressed in work clothing for completely innocent reasons?

What if Cornelius was seeing patterns again instead of evidence?

But.

But what if he was right?

What if, for once, his pattern-recognition was actually correct?

What if the False Gardener truly was moving toward the Orchid right now, and Cornelius did nothing?

Below, the crowd began gathering for the lantern lighting. The string quartet played the ceremonial prelude. Festival-goers pressed toward the platform, eager for the main event.

Zeph and Sophia stood together in the crowd, their hands still linked.

They would be fine without him.

The Orchid might not be.

Cornelius made his decision.

He launched from Saint Kyria's shoulder, wings spreading to catch the air. The beetles scattered around him, briefly disrupting their patterns. His heat-sense locked onto Kyriakos's retreating thermal signature.

The perfumer had reached the coastal path. Moving quickly now. Heading northwest toward Widow's Perch with clear purpose.

Cornelius glided above the Festival crowds, silent and fast. The beetle-light cast strange shadows across the cobblestones below. Music faded behind him as he left Harbor Square.

His wings beat steadily, carrying him over the lower district's rooftops toward the cliffs.

Hunt mode engaged.

Predatory focus narrowed to a single target.

The False Gardener would not reach the Orchid unchallenged.

Not while Cornelius could still fly.

Not while he could still try.

Even if he was wrong.

Even if this was another mistake.

He had to know.

The coastal path stretched ahead, dark except for occasional beetle swarms. Kyriakos moved along it like he knew exactly where he was going.

Because he did.

Because he had Dr. Floros's stolen journal.

Because he had the map.

Cornelius's certainty crystallized as he flew.

This was right.

This was the pattern that actually fit.

And this time—this time—he would not fail.

The Hunt had begun again.

For real this time.

And he would see it through.

Whatever came next.
