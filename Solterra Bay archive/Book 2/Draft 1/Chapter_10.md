# Chapter 10

The reading room had never looked more perfect.

Cornelius had spent the hour between dawn and eight bells arranging it precisely. The long oak table positioned beneath the main chandelier. Six chairs spaced at exact intervals. A carafe of water and glasses set on the sideboard—proper hospitality for what would be a formal proceeding.

His scales gleamed. He had bathed thoroughly after last night's excursion through the ventilation ducts, scrubbing away every trace of dust and grime. His spectacles were polished. His claws were clean.

Everything was ready.

Everything was perfect.

Captain Theo would arrive at nine bells, as requested in the message Cornelius had sent at first light. Dr. Floros was already present, seated at the far end of the table with her hands folded in her lap. She looked tired. Anxious. The weight of the stolen journal and the approaching Orchid bloom had worn on her these past days.

But that would end this morning.

Imelda Kassiani sat beside Dr. Floros, her ancient elf features composed in an expression of patient curiosity. She had arrived unexpectedly an hour ago, drawn by Cornelius's message to Anthea that "significant developments" had occurred. Her presence was both welcome and slightly uncomfortable—Imelda was the one person whose opinion of him truly mattered.

Today, she would see him vindicated.

Zeph hovered near the reference desk, shifting his weight from foot to foot. He had not asked questions when Cornelius instructed him to be present at nine bells. Just nodded and arrived on time, his hair only slightly less chaotic than usual.

Good lad.

Cornelius positioned himself at the head of the table and checked his internal chronometer. Three minutes to nine bells.

Brother Demos would arrive at any moment. Cornelius had sent word to the temple that his presence was required for "urgent library business regarding his carrel materials." Vague enough to avoid suspicion. Specific enough to compel attendance.

The monk would come.

And when he did, Cornelius would have witnesses. Official witnesses. Imelda. Captain Theo. Dr. Floros herself.

No more mistakes.

No more procedural errors.

This time, everything would be done properly.

The library's front door opened. Heavy footsteps echoed through the entrance hall.

Captain Theo appeared in the reading room doorway, his uniform slightly rumpled, his expression hovering somewhere between irritation and cautious curiosity.

"Drake," he said. "Your message indicated this was urgent. I hope you have not wasted Watch resources on another—"

"I have found Dr. Floros's stolen journal," Cornelius interrupted. His voice carried through the reading room with perfect clarity. "And I can prove who took it."

Silence.

Theo's expression shifted. The irritation faded, replaced by sharp attention. "You can prove this?"

"I can."

"With actual evidence? Not patterns or theories or—"

"With the journal itself," Cornelius said. "Hidden in the possession of the individual responsible for both thefts. Present in this very building."

Dr. Floros stood abruptly, her chair scraping against the tile. "You found it? My journal? Where?"

"Patience, Doctor." Cornelius kept his tone gentle but firm. "All will be revealed in moments. Captain, please take a seat. Brother Demos should arrive shortly."

Theo's jaw tightened. "Demos? You are accusing the monk again?"

"I am presenting evidence," Cornelius corrected. "As you requested. Facts, not patterns. The journal's location. Witness testimony. A complete chain of—"

The front door opened again.

Brother Demos entered the reading room, his gray robes dusty from the morning walk. He looked confused. Worried. His gaze darted between the assembled group—Theo in his Watch uniform, Dr. Floros standing rigid with hope, Imelda watching with her ageless calm.

"Head Librarian?" Demos's voice was thin. "Your message said there was urgent business regarding my carrel? Has something—"

"Please sit, Brother Demos." Cornelius gestured to the chair nearest the door. "This will not take long."

The monk sat slowly, his hands gripping the armrests. "I do not understand. What is this about?"

"Truth," Cornelius said simply.

He moved to the center of the room, positioning himself where everyone could see him clearly. His tail swished once—the only outward sign of the satisfaction humming through his scales.

This was the moment.

Four days of investigation. Humiliation. Doubt. Error.

All of it leading here.

To this.

"Four days ago," Cornelius began, "Dr. Anthea Floros reported the theft of her personal field journal from her room at the Sea View Guest House. The journal contained fifty years of botanical research and maps to the location of the Moon-Scented Orchid—a plant that blooms once every fifty years and is scheduled to bloom tomorrow night."

He paused, letting the timeline settle.

"Initially, I pursued several lines of inquiry. I investigated the guest house. Interviewed witnesses. Examined the scene of the theft. I also discovered that a volume from this library's own collection—*Secret Wonders: Field notes on medicinal herbs of the coastal regions*—had been stolen during the same period."

Brother Demos shifted in his chair. "I do not see what this has to—"

"Patience, Brother." Cornelius's voice sharpened. "I made errors in my early investigation. I allowed myself to see patterns instead of evidence. To make assumptions instead of verifying facts. Captain Theo correctly reprimanded me for procedural overreach."

Theo grunted but said nothing.

"However," Cornelius continued, "proper investigation yields proper results. Three days ago, a witness observed a man in monk's robes at the tide pools beneath Widow's Perch. The man was measuring and documenting the pools—precisely the kind of preparation necessary to locate the Moon-Scented Orchid. The witness noted the man carried a brown leather satchel and wore an expensive perfume. Kyriakos No. 5."

Dr. Floros's hands clenched. "The same perfume that was in my room."

"Indeed." Cornelius's gaze fixed on Brother Demos. "The same perfume detected at the scene of the theft. The same brown leather satchel you carry, Brother Demos. The same gray robes you wear now."

The monk's face had gone pale. "I—this is coincidence. Many monks wear gray robes. Many scholars carry satchels. I have never even heard of Kyriakos—"

"Last night," Cornelius said, his voice cutting through the denial, "I located Dr. Floros's stolen journal."

The room went silent.

Even the ambient sounds of the library seemed to stop. No creaking wood. No distant footsteps. Just perfect, absolute silence.

"Where?" Dr. Floros whispered.

Cornelius let the moment extend. Let the tension build.

Then: "Hidden in Carrel Seven. Your assigned study space, Brother Demos. Concealed beneath research papers on your desk. A dark leather journal with a pressed flower design. Exactly matching Dr. Floros's description."

"No." Demos stood, his chair scraping backward. "That is impossible. I have never—I would never—"

"Sit down, Brother." Theo's voice carried the weight of official authority. "You will have a chance to explain."

The monk sat, trembling.

Cornelius felt the Hunt's familiar rush. The predatory certainty. Everything aligned. Everything fit.

"The evidence is clear," he continued. "You stole Dr. Floros's journal to learn the Orchid's location. You surveyed the tide pools personally. You intended either to harvest the Orchid yourself or to provide the information to someone else—most likely Kyriakos Vlahos, who has both motive and means to commission such theft."

"This is insane," Demos said. His voice cracked. "I am a scholar. A monk. I would never—"

"Then explain," Theo interrupted, "why Dr. Floros's journal was found in your carrel."

"It was not! I do not have her journal. I have never seen her journal. I—"

"Denying the facts will not change them, Brother." Cornelius moved to the sideboard and retrieved a cloth-wrapped bundle he had prepared earlier. "I have not yet touched the journal itself. Dr. Floros should be the one to identify and reclaim her property."

He set the bundle on the table before her.

Dr. Floros stared at it, her hands shaking. "That is... that is really it? My journal?"

"See for yourself."

She reached for the bundle with trembling fingers. Pulled back the cloth.

The book lay revealed.

Dark leather cover. Smaller than Cornelius remembered—perhaps seven inches by nine inches. Worn edges. And pressed into the center of the cover, a delicate flower design.

Perfect.

Exactly as he had found it.

Dr. Floros touched the cover gently. Her eyes filled with tears. "I... this is..."

She opened the book.

Cornelius watched her face, expecting relief. Joy. Recognition.

Instead, confusion crossed her features.

"This is not my journal," she said.

The words hit Cornelius like a physical blow.

"What?" His voice came out strangled. "That is impossible. The description matches. The pressed flower design. The dark leather. The—"

"This is not my journal," Dr. Floros repeated. She turned the book so everyone could see the first page. "This is... botanical field notes, yes. But not mine. The handwriting is different. The format is different. This is printed text, not handwritten entries."

Cornelius's world tilted.

No.

No, this was wrong.

He had found it. The journal. The proof. The evidence that would solve everything.

"Let me see that." Theo took the book from Dr. Floros and examined it closely. His expression hardened as he read the title page.

"*Secret Wonders: Field notes on medicinal herbs of the coastal regions,*" Theo read aloud. "Property of the Solterra Bay Public Library."

Silence.

Absolute, crushing silence.

Cornelius's mind went blank. White. Empty.

This was not possible.

He had found a dark leather journal with a pressed flower design in Brother Demos's carrel. Hidden beneath research papers. Everything had fit. Everything had—

"This is your missing library book," Theo said, his voice dangerously quiet. "Not the stolen journal."

"I..." Cornelius could not form words.

Brother Demos stood slowly, his hands still shaking but his voice growing stronger. "I can explain that."

"Please do," Theo said.

The monk swallowed hard. "I—I borrowed it. Against regulations. I know I should have checked it out formally, but the library has a six-week loan limit, and I needed it longer. My research required extended access to specific coastal herb references, and I thought... I thought if I just kept it in my carrel, used it only there, it would not be missed."

"Theft," Cornelius managed. "You stole it."

"I borrowed it improperly," Demos corrected. "I always intended to return it. I was not hiding it from you, Head Librarian. I simply... I needed it. The information was critical for my work on tidal medicinal compounds, and I could not keep renewing the loan without drawing attention."

Theo's gaze fixed on Cornelius. "And this is the evidence you used to accuse Brother Demos of stealing Dr. Floros's journal? A library book that was technically borrowed against policy?"

"It was hidden," Cornelius said desperately. "Beneath papers. Concealed."

"It was on my desk," Demos countered. "Under research notes because I was actively using both simultaneously. I was cross-referencing the coastal herb entries with my own field observations." He turned to Dr. Floros. "I swear to you, Doctor, I have never seen your journal. I have never been to the Sea View Guest House. I do not know Kyriakos Vlahos. I have never worn expensive perfume in my life."

"The witness saw you at the tide pools," Cornelius insisted. "Three days ago. Before dawn. Measuring the—"

"I have not been to Widow's Perch in over a year," Demos said firmly. "I have witnesses. The temple keeps records of our movements. Brother Andreas can confirm I was at morning meditation three days ago. Every day. I follow a strict schedule."

Theo stood. "I will verify that. Immediately." He turned to Cornelius, his expression ice-cold. "You wasted my time. Again."

"The perfume," Cornelius tried. "The brown satchel. The—"

"Circumstantial," Theo interrupted. "You accused a man based on coincidental physical descriptions and a misidentified book. You have no actual evidence. No proof. Nothing."

"Captain, I assure you, I conducted a thorough investigation—"

"You conducted harassment." Theo's voice cut like a blade. "I explicitly ordered you to pursue proper evidence. To work through official channels. And instead, you staged this..." He gestured at the assembled room. "This theatrical accusation. Based on a library book that was technically borrowed against policy."

Cornelius's claws scraped the floor. "Brother Demos violated library regulations—"

"Which is your jurisdiction," Theo said. "Not a criminal matter. Not Watch business. Certainly not grounds for accusing someone of theft in front of witnesses."

Dr. Floros stood, clutching her shawl. "Then my journal is still missing. And the Orchid blooms tomorrow night. And we have no leads. No suspects. Nothing."

"I am sorry, Doctor," Theo said, his tone genuinely regretful. "But this investigation has been compromised from the beginning. The Head Librarian's... enthusiasm... has tainted any legitimate lines of inquiry. Without concrete evidence or credible leads, there is nothing the Watch can do."

"You are abandoning the case?" Cornelius demanded.

"There is no case," Theo said flatly. "No verified crime scene evidence. No credible suspects. Just accusations and theories from a librarian who has repeatedly demonstrated poor judgment." He picked up *Secret Wonders* and handed it back to Cornelius. "File whatever internal library complaint you want against Brother Demos for improper borrowing. But do not waste Watch resources again."

He turned and walked out.

The sound of his footsteps echoed through the reading room like hammer blows.

Brother Demos stood slowly. "I apologize for the improper loan, Head Librarian. I will accept whatever disciplinary measures you deem appropriate. But I did not steal Dr. Floros's journal. I hope you find the real thief."

He left.

The reading room felt cavernous now. Empty.

Dr. Floros looked at Cornelius with something worse than anger.

Disappointment.

"I thought..." She shook her head. "Imelda said you were the best. That you would help. But this..." She gathered her shawl tighter. "The Orchid blooms in twenty-four hours. And you have nothing. No journal. No leads. Nothing."

She walked out.

Imelda remained seated, her ageless eyes fixed on Cornelius with an expression he could not read.

"You made a mistake," she said quietly.

"I was certain," Cornelius whispered. "The evidence fit. The pattern was clear. I—"

"You were wrong." Imelda stood. "And worse, you accused someone publicly without verifying your facts. Brother Demos is guilty only of academic desperation and poor library etiquette. You humiliated him. Wasted Captain Theo's time. And destroyed Dr. Floros's remaining hope."

Each word landed like a stone.

"I will speak with Anthea," Imelda continued. "Try to salvage what I can. You..." She paused. "You should consider whether your pride has compromised your ability to help anyone."

She left.

Cornelius stood alone at the head of the table.

The perfect reading room.

The perfect arrangement.

All of it meaningless.

Zeph approached cautiously from the reference desk. "Boss? Are you—"

"Leave," Cornelius said. His voice came out hollow. "Just... leave."

Zeph hesitated, then nodded and retreated toward the entrance hall.

Cornelius looked down at *Secret Wonders* in his claws.

The book he had labeled "MISPLACED" weeks ago because he could not bear the humiliation of admitting theft.

The book he had changed to "STOLEN" last night in a fit of triumphant certainty.

The book that was neither stolen nor misplaced, just borrowed improperly by a desperate student who could not afford to keep renewing loans.

He had been so certain.

So absolutely, completely certain.

The journal had been there. In the carrel. Dark leather. Pressed flower design. Hidden beneath papers.

Everything had fit.

Except it had not been the journal at all.

Just a library book that looked similar.

A pattern that was not actually a pattern.

Evidence that was not actually evidence.

Cornelius's legs gave out. He sat heavily in the nearest chair, his tail curling around his body.

Dr. Floros's journal was still missing.

The real thief was still free.

The Orchid would bloom tomorrow night, and Kyriakos—or whoever the False Gardener truly was—would harvest it.

And Cornelius had nothing.

No leads. No suspects. No credibility.

Captain Theo had shut down the investigation.

Imelda was disappointed in him.

Dr. Floros had lost hope.

He had failed.

Completely, publicly, humiliatingly failed.

The library was silent around him.

His hoard. His responsibility. His sanctuary.

And he could not even protect one stolen journal.

Cornelius stared at *Secret Wonders* in his claws and felt something crack inside his chest.

Not his pride.

Deeper than that.

His certainty.

His belief that order could be maintained. That patterns revealed truth. That careful investigation always yielded answers.

All of it was gone.

The Hunt was over.

And he had caught nothing.
