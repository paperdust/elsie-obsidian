# Chapter 14

"Boss!"

Zeph's voice cut through the Festival noise from somewhere behind the silk pavilion tents. Cornelius folded his wings and dropped from the lantern post where he had landed after his frantic glide back from Widow's Perch.

His claws hit packed earth. His scales were still damp from ocean spray. His spectacles sat crooked on his snout.

He did not care.

Seventy minutes until midnight.

Seventy minutes until Kyriakos smothered the Moon-Scented Orchid for profit.

Cornelius scrambled toward Zeph's voice, weaving between tent stakes and discarded Festival debris. The Twinkle beetles provided just enough light to navigate by. Their blue-green glow pulsed in rhythm with the distant music.

He rounded the corner of a purple silk tent and found Zeph standing with Sophia in a small clearing between pavilions. They were still holding hands.

Good.

That could wait.

"Kyriakos attacked Orestes," Cornelius said without preamble. His breath came short from the flight. "Drugged him with chloroform. Left him bound on the cliff. He is going after the Orchid right now."

Zeph's hand dropped from Sophia's. "Wait, what? The perfumer? But you cleared him. You said—"

"I was wrong." The words came easier this time. Faster. "He has Dr. Floros's stolen journal. He set a wire trap on the path down to the tide pools. He is waiting there with laboratory equipment for the bloom at midnight."

Sophia's thermal signature spiked. "Laboratory equipment?"

"Glass apparatus. Specialized bottles and tubes." Cornelius's tail lashed. "I found a shard at the cliff. Borosilicate. Same as the fragments in Dr. Floros's room."

"Let me see it." Sophia's voice carried an edge Cornelius had not heard before. Not anger. Something sharper. Professional focus.

He carefully extracted the glass shard from where he had wedged it between his scales for safekeeping during the flight. The fragment caught beetle-light, glinting blue-green.

Sophia took it from his claw and held it close to her face. Her fingers traced the curved edge. The break pattern. The thickness.

Her expression changed.

"Oh no," she said quietly. "Oh no, no, no."

"What?" Zeph moved closer to her. "What is it?"

"This is mine." Sophia's hand closed around the shard. Her knuckles went white. "This is from the prototype I made for him. The one he commissioned last month."

Cornelius went very still. "Commissioned?"

"He came to our guild." Sophia's words came faster now. Angrier. "Said he needed specialized glassware for a 'delicate botanical project.' Wanted containers that could capture and preserve volatile aromatic compounds without degradation. He was very specific about the requirements."

"What requirements?" Cornelius asked.

Sophia turned the shard over in her palm. "Airtight seal. Lead-reinforced rim to prevent vapor escape. Internal coating resistant to organic acids. And—" She stopped. Her thermal signature flared hotter. "And a one-way valve system that allows gases to enter but prevents them from leaving once the seal is set."

The pieces assembled in Cornelius's mind with terrible clarity.

"He is not stealing the Orchid," he said slowly. "He is going to trap its scent."

"Worse." Sophia's voice was tight. "The Orchid releases pheromones when it blooms. That is what creates the fragrance. Those pheromones are meant to attract a specific pollinator—probably something nocturnal that only appears during the full moon."

"A moth," Zeph said suddenly. "I read about it in one of the botanical texts. The Moon-Moth. It only flies during certain lunar phases."

Sophia nodded. "If Kyriakos captures the pheromones in this jar before the moth arrives—"

"The Orchid will not be pollinated," Cornelius finished. His scales prickled cold. "It blooms once every fifty years. If it misses this pollination window—"

"Extinction." The word came from behind them.

Cornelius spun.

Orestes stood at the edge of the clearing, leaning heavily against a tent pole. His face was still too pale. His breathing still labored. But his eyes burned with the same fury Cornelius had seen in the alcove.

"The Orchid has been declining for centuries," Orestes continued. "There used to be dozens of sites along this coast. Now there is only one. This bloom—" He coughed wetly. "This bloom might be the last chance for the species to reproduce."

"And Kyriakos knows that," Sophia said. Her hand tightened on the glass shard until Cornelius worried it might cut her. "He knows that if he captures this bloom's pheromones, he will have the only sample. Forever. No one else could create the fragrance. It would be completely unique."

"Exclusive," Cornelius said. The word tasted bitter. "Worth a fortune to collectors who value rarity above all else."

"Worth more if it is the last one," Orestes added. "A perfume made from an extinct flower. The ultimate luxury. The ultimate proof of wealth and status."

Zeph made a disgusted sound. "That is sick."

"That is Kyriakos." Sophia's voice carried personal weight. Old anger. "He steals things that cannot be replaced. My family's glaze formula. Dr. Floros's research. And now—" She looked at the glass shard in her palm. "Now he is going to steal an entire species' future."

Silence fell over the clearing.

Around them, the Festival continued. Music and laughter and the soft pulse of beetle-light. People celebrating Twinkle Nights without knowledge that fifty feet below the cliffs, a man prepared to commit botanical murder for profit.

Cornelius's mind raced through options.

Captain Theo. Call the Watch. Present evidence. Make arrests.

Except.

Theo had explicitly ordered Cornelius to stop wasting Watch resources on unfounded accusations. Had documented Cornelius's previous failures. Had made it clear that any further interference would result in charges.

And even if Theo believed him this time—which seemed unlikely given Cornelius's record—gathering Watch officers and reaching the tide pools would take at least an hour.

They had sixty-five minutes until midnight.

Maybe sixty now.

Not enough time.

"We cannot get the Watch there in time," Cornelius said aloud. The admission felt like failure. Like another mistake in a long series of mistakes. "Even if Captain Theo believed me—"

"He would not," Orestes interrupted. "Not after this morning. You accused the wrong man. Publicly. With ceremony."

The words stung because they were true.

Cornelius had burned his credibility with Theo. With the Watch. With anyone who might have helped.

This morning's humiliation in the reading room had cost him more than professional pride. It had cost him institutional support exactly when he needed it most.

He had done this to himself.

"So what do we do?" Zeph asked. "Just let him get away with it?"

"No." Sophia's voice was flat. Certain. "We stop him ourselves."

Cornelius looked at her. At Zeph. At Orestes still leaning on the tent pole, barely recovered from chloroform exposure.

They were not Watch officers.

They were a tile artist with a grudge. A library intern. A drugged hermit. And a disgraced librarian whose investigative instincts had proven catastrophically unreliable.

This was not a team.

This was a disaster waiting to happen.

Except.

Except Sophia knew glass. Knew exactly what apparatus Kyriakos was using and how it worked.

Zeph knew the coastal paths. Had grown up exploring the cliffs and tide pools.

Orestes knew the Orchid. Had guarded it for decades. Understood its biology and ecology in ways no book could teach.

And Cornelius—

Cornelius could fly. Could see in darkness with heat-sense. Could fit through spaces humans could not. Could breathe fire if necessary.

Small fire.

Very small fire.

But fire nonetheless.

"The wire trap," Cornelius said slowly. "Can you disable it?"

Orestes shook his head. "Not in my current condition. The chloroform is still interfering with my ability to merge with stone. I would need to approach the wire physically, and I—" He gestured at his trembling hands. "I would likely trigger it."

"I could do it," Zeph offered. "If someone told me where it was."

"Too dangerous," Cornelius said automatically. Then stopped himself.

That was the old pattern. The old Cornelius who worked alone. Who trusted only his own judgment.

The same Cornelius who had wrongly accused Brother Demos. Who had staged a theatrical reading room confrontation based on incomplete evidence. Who had lost Imelda's respect and Theo's cooperation.

Working alone had failed.

Spectacularly.

Multiple times.

"Actually," Cornelius said carefully, "if Orestes could guide you from above with precise directions, and if you moved slowly, checking each step—"

"I can do that," Zeph said. His voice carried new confidence. The same confidence he had shown when talking to Sophia about art and science. When giving her the gift. When kissing her.

When being brave about things that mattered.

"The jar," Sophia said. "Even if we reach Kyriakos, we need to stop him from sealing it. Once the lead rim locks, the pheromones are trapped. But—" She examined the glass shard again. "The seal requires heat. Specific, focused heat applied to the rim for exactly thirty seconds to activate the lead bonding."

"What kind of heat source?" Cornelius asked.

"He commissioned a small alchemical torch from my guild along with the jar. Portable. Blue flame. Very precise temperature control."

"So if we prevent him from using the torch—" Zeph started.

"The jar stays open," Sophia finished. "The pheromones can escape. The moth can find the Orchid."

"And if we break the jar?" Cornelius asked.

Sophia shook her head. "Borosilicate is incredibly strong. You would need significant force or—" She paused. "Or you would need to heat one specific point to critical temperature and then apply rapid cooling. The thermal shock would shatter it."

"How hot?"

"Hotter than an alchemical torch. You would need—" Sophia looked at Cornelius. Her eyes widened slightly. "You would need dragon fire."

Cornelius's breath weapon flickered involuntarily at the back of his throat. A tiny blue flame barely larger than a candle's worth.

Not impressive.

Not powerful.

But very, very hot.

Library Dragons used their fire for precision work. Melting wax seals. Cauterizing torn pages. Fusing gold leaf to leather bindings.

Delicate applications requiring intense heat in small areas.

Exactly what Sophia described.

"I can do that," Cornelius said. "If I can get close enough to the jar."

"Kyriakos will not let you get close," Orestes said. "He has chloroform. If he used it on me, he will use it on you."

"Not if he does not see me coming." Cornelius's mind was already mapping the approach. The shadows near the tide pools. The rock formations Orestes had described. The wind that would carry any warning scent away from the pools rather than toward them. "I am small. Quiet. I can move through spaces humans cannot. And my heat-sense works in complete darkness."

"What about the wire?" Zeph asked.

"You disable it. With Orestes's guidance." Cornelius looked at the hermit. "Can you make it to the alcove above the pools? Direct Zeph from there?"

Orestes straightened slightly. His thermal signature was still weak but warming as the drug cleared his system. "Yes. If we move soon. Before I—" He swayed. Caught himself. "Before I lose more time to recovery."

"I am going too." Sophia's voice left no room for argument. "I know that glass. I designed it. If something goes wrong, I can—" She stopped. Started again more carefully. "I need to be there. He used my work to do this. My design. I need to help stop him."

Cornelius wanted to refuse. To say it was too dangerous. That she should stay at the Festival where it was safe.

But he thought about this morning. About making decisions alone. About being wrong.

About how every person here brought something essential.

"Alright," he said. "But we move carefully. We coordinate. We do not take unnecessary risks."

"Since when do you avoid unnecessary risks?" Zeph asked. "You crawled through air vents last night. You glided off a cliff in murder-wind twenty minutes ago."

"Since those unnecessary risks were mine alone to take." Cornelius met Zeph's eyes. Then Sophia's. Then Orestes's. "This time we work as a team. That means we keep each other safe."

The words felt strange. Unfamiliar.

Also right.

Also necessary.

"How much time do we have?" Sophia asked.

Cornelius checked the moon's position through a gap in the tent canopy. "Fifty-five minutes. Perhaps less."

"Then we need to move now." Orestes pushed away from the tent pole. His balance was poor but functional. "The coastal path is twenty minutes' walk from here. We need—"

"Fifteen if we run," Zeph interrupted. "I know a shortcut through the lower market."

"Twelve if I carry someone," Cornelius said. "I can manage short flights with a passenger if they are not too heavy."

"I am too heavy," Orestes said immediately. "And too unstable. I would unbalance you."

"Not me," Sophia said. She looked at Cornelius with calculation. "I weigh maybe ninety pounds. Could you—"

"Yes." Cornelius spread his wings, demonstrating wingspan. "It will be uncomfortable for both of us. But possible."

"Then Sophia flies with you," Zeph said. "Orestes and I take the shortcut on foot. We meet at the alcove above the pools."

"And then?" Sophia asked.

Cornelius's tail curled and uncurled as he organized the sequence. As he planned.

As he did what librarians did: created order from chaos.

"Orestes guides Zeph to the wire trap. Zeph disables it. That clears the path down to the pools." He looked at Sophia. "You and I approach Kyriakos's position from above using stealth. We locate the jar. I apply fire to create thermal stress. You tell me exactly where and how long. The jar shatters."

"And Kyriakos?" Orestes asked.

"We do not engage him directly unless necessary," Cornelius said. "We are not trying to arrest him. We are trying to save the Orchid."

"But if he tries to stop us—" Zeph started.

"Then we improvise." Cornelius looked at each of them in turn. "But the priority is always the bloom. Always the Orchid. Kyriakos can be dealt with later through proper channels and actual evidence. The Orchid only blooms tonight."

Sophia nodded slowly. "Save the flower first."

"Save the flower first," Cornelius confirmed.

The phrase settled over them like a vow.

"We should go now," Orestes said. "While I still can."

"Right." Zeph squared his shoulders. "Lower market shortcut. Fifteen minutes. Don't wait for us if we're late."

"We will not be late," Orestes said firmly.

Sophia looked at Cornelius. "I have never been carried by a dragon before."

"I have never carried a passenger before," Cornelius admitted. "This will be educational for both of us."

"Grand." Sophia's smile was tight. Nervous. "How do I—"

"Climb onto my back. Between my wings. Hold onto the base of my neck. Do not restrict my breathing."

Sophia crouched and carefully positioned herself across Cornelius's shoulders. Her weight settled evenly. Her hands found purchase just behind his jaw.

Uncomfortable.

Undignified.

But functional.

Cornelius's wings spread. His claws gripped the packed earth.

"Ready?" he asked.

"No," Sophia said. "But let's go anyway."

Cornelius launched.

His wings beat hard against the added weight. The initial lift was terrible. Graceless. He barely cleared the tent canopy.

But then the air caught properly beneath his wings. His flight stabilized. The Festival fell away below as he climbed toward the beetle swarms.

Sophia's grip tightened. "Oh gods. Oh gods. This is insane."

"Focus on the horizon," Cornelius advised. "Do not look down. Breathe steadily."

"Right. Horizon. Breathing. Not looking at the extremely long drop to the—I looked down."

"Stop looking down."

"Stopping now."

Cornelius angled northwest. The coastal path appeared below, a dark line against darker cliffs. Ahead, Widow's Perch rose like a stone finger pointing at the moon.

Fifty minutes until midnight.

Fifty minutes to save a flower.

To stop a collector who valued possession over existence.

To prove that beauty did not need to be owned to matter.

Cornelius's wings beat steadily. The wind from the ocean fought each stroke. Sophia's weight made every adjustment harder. More deliberate.

But they were flying.

Actually flying.

Toward the Orchid.

Toward Kyriakos.

Toward either redemption or another catastrophic failure.

Except this time Cornelius was not alone.

This time he had a team.

A strange team.

A team assembled from failure and grudges and botanical desperation.

But a team nonetheless.

"How much farther?" Sophia asked. Her voice was steadier now. Adjusting to the flight.

"Three minutes to the alcove," Cornelius estimated. "Then we wait for Zeph and Orestes."

"And then?"

"Then we save the Orchid."

"Just like that?"

"Just like that."

Sophia was quiet for several wingbeats. Then: "Thank you. For not leaving this alone. For chasing the pattern even after—" She hesitated. "Even after this morning."

"The pattern was wrong this morning," Cornelius said. "Brother Demos was innocent."

"But you were right about the perfume. About the glass. About Kyriakos."

"Eventually."

"Eventually counts." Sophia's hands shifted slightly on his neck. "Zeph told me about Code Obsidian. About Captain Theo's reprimand. About how you almost quit this case."

"I should have quit. My interference made everything worse."

"Your interference is the only reason we know Kyriakos is at the tide pools right now." Sophia's voice was firm. "Maybe you got some details wrong. Maybe you accused the wrong person. But you kept looking. You kept trying. And now you are here."

"We are here," Cornelius corrected.

"Right. We."

The word felt significant.

We.

Not I.

Not alone.

Widow's Perch resolved from darkness ahead. The alcove appeared as a deeper shadow against the cliff face. Cornelius angled his approach, fighting the wind for every foot of altitude.

This time when he landed, Sophia was already braced for the impact. They hit the alcove's stone surface together and rolled once before Cornelius's claws found purchase.

Sophia climbed off his back. Her legs trembled slightly. "That was horrible."

"You did well."

"I almost vomited twice."

"But you did not actually vomit. That is what matters."

Sophia laughed. The sound was shaky but genuine. "Dragon logic."

"The only reliable kind."

Below, somewhere in the darkness, Kyriakos waited beside the largest tide pool with his stolen journal and his specially commissioned glass jar.

Waiting for midnight.

Waiting for the bloom.

Waiting to trap beauty in a bottle and let a species die.

Cornelius's scales prickled with cold fury.

Not this time.

Not while he could still fly.

Not while he still had fire.

"They are coming," Sophia said, pointing toward the coastal path.

Two thermal signatures approached. Moving quickly despite the darkness. Despite the dangerous footing.

Zeph and Orestes.

The team was assembling.

The Hunt continued.

And this time—this time—Cornelius would not fail.

Could not fail.

Too much depended on it.

Everything depended on it.

The Orchid.

Dr. Floros's stolen work.

The Moon-Moth that would arrive expecting pheromones and finding only empty air if they failed.

Fifty years until the next bloom.

Fifty years the species did not have.

This was their chance.

Their only chance.

Cornelius's wings folded against his sides.

His claws gripped stone.

His breath weapon flickered ready at the back of his throat.

"When Zeph and Orestes arrive," he said quietly, "we begin."

Sophia nodded. Her hand still held the glass shard. Her expression was set. Determined.

"We do not go to arrest him," Cornelius said. "We go to save the flower."

"To save the flower," Sophia repeated.

And below them in the darkness, the Moon-Scented Orchid prepared to bloom.
