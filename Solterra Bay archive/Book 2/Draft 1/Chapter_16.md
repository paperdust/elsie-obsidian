# Chapter 16

The crowd was impossible.

Cornelius crouched on Zeph's shoulder, claws gripping fabric, while bodies pressed in from all sides. The Festival had turned Harbor Square into a solid mass of humans, satyrs, and orcs, all surging toward the lantern ceremony. 

Forty minutes until midnight.

Maybe less.

And they were trapped.

"This is not working," Cornelius said directly into Zeph's ear. His heat-sense showed nothing but warm bodies packed shoulder to shoulder. No gaps. No paths. No way through.

"I know." Zeph tried to push forward. A satyr vendor with a tray of roasted chestnuts blocked the way completely, arguing with someone about prices. "Excuse me. Pardon. We need to—"

No one moved.

No one was moving anywhere.

The coastal path was fifty feet ahead. Might as well have been fifty miles.

Cornelius's tail lashed in frustration. His breath weapon flickered involuntarily at the back of his throat.

They were losing time.

Kyriakos was already at the pools. Already digging. Already—

"The rooftops," Cornelius said.

Zeph stopped trying to push through the crowd. "What?"

"The rooftops are empty. Everyone is down here." Cornelius's mind was already tracing the route. The same path he had flown alone in Chapter 15. But this time he was not alone. "We go up."

"Boss, I cannot fly."

"No. But you can climb."

Zeph's thermal signature shifted. Uncertainty. "Climb what exactly?"

Cornelius extended one claw, pointing toward the building beside them. A two-story warehouse with barrels stacked against the wall. "There. The drainage pipe runs to the roof. From there we cross the guild hall. Then the customs house. Then the cliff."

"That is insane."

"That is our only option." Cornelius adjusted his grip on Zeph's shoulder. "Unless you prefer to stand here while Kyriakos steals the Orchid."

Zeph looked at the warehouse. At the crowd. At the distant cliffs barely visible past the lantern-light.

Then he moved.

Not toward the coastal path.

Toward the warehouse wall.

"You are completely insane," Zeph muttered. But he was already shoving through the crowd sideways, aiming for the narrow gap between buildings. "You know that, right?"

"I am efficient," Cornelius corrected. "There is a difference."

They reached the wall. The crowd thinned here. Most people were packed toward the square's center where the lantern ceremony would happen.

The drainage pipe was old iron. Riveted seams. Brackets anchoring it to limestone every six feet.

Climbable.

Probably.

"You are sure about this?" Zeph asked.

"No." Cornelius launched from Zeph's shoulder and landed on the first bracket. His claws gripped iron that was still warm from the day's retained heat. "But I am certain we have no alternative."

"That is not reassuring."

"I am a librarian, not a motivational speaker."

Zeph grabbed the pipe with both hands. Tested his weight.

The pipe held.

He started climbing.

Cornelius went first. His smaller size made the brackets easy to navigate. Claw over claw. Tail for balance. Wings folded tight against his sides.

Ten feet up.

Fifteen.

Below, the Festival continued. Music and laughter and the soft pulse of beetle-light. No one looked up. No one noticed two figures climbing a warehouse wall in darkness.

Twenty feet.

Zeph was keeping pace. His breathing was controlled. Steady. 

Cornelius's heat-sense tracked his progress. Hands gripping iron. Feet finding purchase on brackets. Moving with surprising confidence for someone who claimed to be afraid of heights.

"Where did you learn to climb?" Cornelius asked.

"Trees." Zeph pulled himself up another bracket. "When I was younger. There is a grove south of the market. We used to—" He caught himself. "Does not matter."

But it did matter.

Because Zeph was good at this.

Really good.

His movements were efficient. Practiced. The kind of muscle memory that came from years of scrambling up things that were not meant to be climbed.

They reached the roof.

Cornelius pulled himself over the edge first. The warehouse roof was flat. Covered in terra-cotta tiles that were slick with ocean spray but manageable.

Zeph hauled himself up beside him. "Okay. That was not terrible."

"The difficult part has not started yet." Cornelius moved to the roof's far edge. His heat-sense mapped the route ahead.

The guild hall was thirty feet away. Across an alley barely six feet wide.

Cornelius could glide it easily.

Zeph could not.

"There is a plank," Cornelius said, spotting it near the roof's corner. Someone had left a wide board there. Probably for maintenance work. "We use that as a bridge."

"That plank is maybe eight inches wide."

"Correct."

"And the drop is two stories."

"Also correct."

"Boss, I am not walking across an eight-inch plank in the dark."

Cornelius examined the alley below with his heat-sense. Empty. But the fall would be. Unpleasant. At minimum.

"Then we find another route," he said.

But there was no other route.

The crowd blocked the ground level. The buildings were spaced too far for Zeph to jump. And the coastal path was still gridlocked with Festival attendees.

They needed to cross this gap.

Somehow.

Cornelius studied the plank more carefully. It was positioned at the roof's edge, tied down with rope. Someone had definitely used it as a bridge before.

"It will hold your weight," Cornelius said. "The wood is sound."

"That is not the problem. The problem is I cannot balance on something that narrow while twenty feet in the air."

Cornelius's tail curled thoughtfully. Then: "What if I guide you?"

"How?"

"I fly beside you. If you start to fall, I—" He stopped. Reconsidered. "Actually, I cannot catch you. You weigh too much."

"Again. Not reassuring."

"But I can tell you when you are leaning incorrectly. My heat-sense can detect your balance shifting before you feel it."

Zeph looked at the plank. At the gap. At the guild hall roof beyond.

"This is a terrible idea," he said.

"I am open to better suggestions."

Silence.

Then Zeph moved to the plank. Started untying the ropes holding it down. "If I die, you have to tell Sophia it was heroic."

"If you die, the Orchid dies with you." Cornelius positioned himself at the plank's near end. "So do not die."

Together they maneuvered the plank across the gap. It was heavier than it looked. Solid oak. But the weight made it stable once positioned.

The far end settled onto the guild hall roof with a dull thunk.

Eight inches wide.

Six feet across empty air.

Zeph stared at it. "I hate this. I want you to know I hate this."

"Noted." Cornelius spread his wings. "Now walk."

"Just. Walk."

"Yes. One foot in front of the other. Do not look down. Do not think about the drop. Focus on the far edge."

"You are terrible at this."

"I am being efficient."

Zeph took a breath. Stepped onto the plank.

His first step was tentative. Testing. The wood barely flexed under his weight.

Second step. More confident.

Third step.

"You are leaning left," Cornelius said, hovering beside him. "Shift your weight right. Small adjustment."

Zeph corrected. The lean evened out.

Fourth step.

Fifth.

Halfway across.

The wind picked up. Not much. Just enough to make the plank creak.

Zeph froze. "Boss."

"You are fine. The plank is stable. Keep moving."

"The wind—"

"Is less than five knots. Insufficient to destabilize you. Keep moving."

Sixth step.

Seventh.

Almost there.

Zeph's foot reached the guild hall roof. He stepped off the plank and immediately sat down hard on the tiles. "Never again."

"Agreed." Cornelius landed beside him. "That was inefficient. We need a better method for the next crossing."

"The next—" Zeph stared at him. "There is another gap?"

"Three more, actually."

Zeph made a sound that was probably supposed to be words. It was not.

But he stood up.

Because they had thirty-five minutes until midnight.

And Kyriakos was still ahead of them.

The guild hall roof was peaked. Steep tiles that required actual climbing rather than walking. Cornelius went first again, his claws finding purchase on the terra-cotta.

Zeph followed. Slower. Using the same techniques he had used on the pipe. Hands and feet. Testing each grip.

They reached the peak.

From here, Cornelius's heat-sense could map half the city. The Festival below. The coastal path. The cliffs beyond.

And there.

A single warm thermal signature moving along Widow's Perch approach.

Kyriakos.

Still ahead.

But not by much.

"I see him," Cornelius said quietly.

Zeph pulled himself up beside him. "Where?"

Cornelius pointed. "The cliff path. He has maybe ten minutes head start now."

"Can we catch him?"

Cornelius traced the route in his mind. The customs house was still ahead. Then the cliff itself. The climb would be faster with Zeph than it had been alone. Zeph had reach. Human strength.

"Maybe," Cornelius said. "If we move quickly."

The descent down the guild hall's far side was easier than the climb up. Gravity helped. They half-slid down the tiles to the next roof edge.

The customs house waited across another gap.

This one was wider.

Ten feet at least.

No plank would bridge it.

"We jump," Cornelius said.

"No."

"We jump or we go back down to the crowd."

"There has to be another—" Zeph stopped. Looked at the gap. At the customs house roof. "Ten feet."

"Approximately."

"I can jump maybe eight feet. On flat ground. With a running start."

"Then you will need to jump farther tonight." Cornelius's tail lashed. "Or I carry you across."

"You said I was too heavy."

"For sustained flight. Not for a glide across ten feet of open air."

Zeph looked at him. At the gap. Back at him.

"You are serious."

"Completely." Cornelius moved to the roof edge. "You get a running start. I grab you at the edge. We glide together to the far roof."

"And if you cannot hold my weight?"

"Then we both fall and this entire evening becomes significantly more complicated."

Zeph laughed. It sounded slightly unhinged. "You know what? Fine. Let's do the insane thing."

He backed up. Gave himself maybe fifteen feet of roof space.

Cornelius positioned himself at the edge. Wings spread. Claws ready.

"On three," he said.

"Wait. Who counts?"

"I count. You run."

"Right. You count."

Cornelius watched Zeph's thermal signature. Watched his weight shift. His muscles tense.

"One."

Zeph started running.

"Two."

Faster. Building speed.

"Three."

Zeph hit the roof edge and jumped.

Cornelius launched at the same moment.

His claws caught Zeph's shoulders mid-flight. The weight was immediate. Terrible. His wings screamed in protest.

But they were gliding.

Falling, really.

But falling forward.

The customs house roof rushed up to meet them.

Five feet.

Three.

Cornelius's wings beat once. Hard. Changing their angle just enough.

They hit tile together. Rolled. Zeph's elbow cracked against terra-cotta. Cornelius's spectacles went flying.

But they were across.

They were across and nothing was broken.

Cornelius retrieved his spectacles. One lens had a new scratch. Unacceptable. But functional.

"That," Zeph said from where he was sprawled on the roof, "was the worst thing I have ever done."

"Worse than asking Sophia to the lantern ceremony?"

"So much worse."

"Then get up. We are not finished."

The customs house roof was the highest point in this section of the city. From here, Widow's Perch was visible as a dark mass against the star-filled sky.

And there.

A tiny pinpoint of light moving along the cliff face.

A lantern.

Kyriakos's lantern.

He was climbing. Already halfway to the summit.

"He is going to beat us," Zeph said quietly.

"Not necessarily." Cornelius's heat-sense swept the area below. Searching. Looking for—

There.

Two more thermal signatures. Moving along the coastal path.

Smaller than Kyriakos. One human-sized. One slightly cooler. Dryad-touched.

Sophia and Orestes.

They had made it out of the crowd. Were approaching the cliff from below.

The team was converging.

Three routes. Three approaches.

All aiming for the same summit.

Cornelius's breath weapon flickered at the back of his throat. Not deliberately. Just instinct. The predatory part of his brain recognizing a Hunt.

A real Hunt.

He opened his mouth.

And roared.

Not a large roar. Library Dragons did not have the lung capacity for truly impressive vocalizations.

But loud enough.

Sharp enough.

A sound that cut through the Festival noise and echoed off the cliff face.

Below, one of the approaching thermal signatures stopped. Looked up.

Sophia had heard.

She would know they were coming.

Would know the chase was still happening.

Cornelius looked at Zeph. "Can you climb the cliff?"

"In the dark? With no rope?"

"Yes."

Zeph stared at Widow's Perch. At the vertical limestone wall. At the impossible height.

Then he looked at Cornelius.

And smiled.

It was not a confident smile.

It was the smile of someone who had jumped a ten-foot gap and survived.

The smile of someone who was done being afraid.

"You know what?" Zeph said. "Yes. I can climb it."

"Good." Cornelius spread his wings. "Then we go now."

They descended the customs house the fast way. Straight down the drainage pipe. No careful climbing. Just controlled falling with periodic grabs to slow momentum.

They hit the ground running.

The cliff base was empty. Everyone was at the Festival. The coastal path showed recent foot traffic. Sophia and Orestes had passed through minutes ago.

Widow's Perch loomed above them.

Two hundred feet of vertical limestone.

Cornelius had climbed it once already tonight. His claws still ached from gripping cold stone. His wings still trembled slightly from the earlier flight.

He would climb it again.

Had to climb it again.

Because somewhere above, Kyriakos was approaching the Orchid with stolen knowledge and a prepared excavation plan.

And somewhere ahead, Sophia and Orestes were climbing the proper path. The safe path.

The slow path.

"Where do we start?" Zeph asked.

Cornelius's heat-sense mapped the cliff face. Found the same route he had used before. Ledges. Outcroppings. Cracks in the limestone.

"There." He pointed with one claw. "Follow exactly where I climb. Do not improvise. Do not try shortcuts."

"Got it."

Cornelius started up.

The stone was cold. Slick with spray. His claws found the first handhold and pulled.

Behind him, Zeph followed.

Twenty feet.

Cornelius's wings wanted to spread. Wanted to catch air and glide. But the wind was wrong. The angle was wrong. Spreading his wings here would just make him a sail for the gale to rip off the cliff face.

So he climbed.

Forty feet.

Zeph was still behind him. His breathing was controlled. Steady. The same rhythm he had used on the rooftops.

Sixty feet.

Halfway.

Cornelius's claws burned. His tail was cramping from constant counterbalance work.

Library work did not prepare a dragon for this.

Cataloging did not build the muscles needed to climb vertical cliffs in darkness while racing a perfumer to an extinct flower.

But he climbed anyway.

Eighty feet.

Above, the lantern light still moved. Kyriakos was nearing the summit. They were gaining. Not enough. But gaining.

One hundred feet.

Zeph's hand slipped.

Cornelius heard it. The scrape of palm against stone. The sharp intake of breath.

He looked down.

Zeph had caught himself. Three contact points still solid. But his hand was bleeding. Cornelius could see the thermal bloom of fresh blood against cold stone.

"Keep climbing," Cornelius said.

"I am fine."

"I did not ask if you were fine. I said keep climbing."

Zeph kept climbing.

One hundred twenty feet.

The alcove was close now. The same alcove where Orestes had been drugged. Where Sophia had waited. Where Cornelius had prepared to dive toward the pools.

One hundred forty feet.

Cornelius's claw found the alcove edge. He pulled himself up. Rolled onto flat stone.

Zeph appeared behind him. His hands were definitely bleeding. His breathing was labored.

But he was here.

They were here.

Both of them.

Cornelius moved to the alcove edge. His heat-sense swept the tide pools below.

No thermal signature by the pools.

Kyriakos was not there yet.

But the baked soil was visible even from this height. A circle of hardened earth where Cornelius's fire had fused the substrate.

The Orchid was still there.

Still protected.

Still alive.

For now.

Movement on the path below caught his attention. Two figures climbing. Moving faster now. No longer constrained by crowds or rooftops.

Sophia and Orestes.

Maybe five minutes behind Kyriakos.

Maybe seven minutes behind Cornelius and Zeph.

The team was converging on the summit.

All routes leading to the same tiny flower growing from a crack in submerged limestone.

Cornelius's breath weapon flickered ready.

His claws gripped stone.

"How much time?" Zeph asked between breaths.

Cornelius checked the moon's position. Did the mental calculation.

"Twenty minutes until midnight," he said. "Perhaps less."

"And Kyriakos?"

The lantern was directly above them now. Almost at the summit. Almost at the path that led down to the pools.

Almost at the Orchid.

"Close," Cornelius said.

Very close.

Too close.

"Then we go faster." Zeph was already moving toward the next section of cliff. The final vertical stretch to the summit.

The

 most dangerous part.

The part where one wrong grip meant a two-hundred-foot fall to the rocks below.

Cornelius spread his wings slightly. Not for flight. For balance.

"Stay close," he said. "We finish this together."

Together.

Not alone.

Not isolated.

Together.

They started climbing.

The summit waited above.

The Orchid waited below.

And somewhere between the two, a perfumer with stolen knowledge and alchemical tools prepared to commit botanical murder for profit.

Twenty minutes until midnight.

The race was almost over.

One way or another, it would end at the top.
