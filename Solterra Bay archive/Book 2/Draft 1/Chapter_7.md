# Chapter 7

The roof tiles were cold. Also uneven. Also covered in a fine layer of salt residue that left grit under Cornelius's claws.

He had been crouched behind the decorative cornice of the Harbor Master's building for approximately twenty-three minutes, watching the Festival Market below with the patient stillness of a gargoyle. A very uncomfortable, very annoyed gargoyle who had better things to do with his evening than supervise a sixteen-year-old's romantic endeavors.

But here he was.

Zeph stood near the fountain—the same fountain where Sophia had apparently waited in vain the previous night—shifting his weight from foot to foot. He had changed clothes again. The cream shirt from this morning was gone, replaced by something dark blue that did not bear any visible stains. His hair had been wrestled into submission with what looked like excessive amounts of pomade. He kept touching it. Then stopping himself. Then touching it again.

Cornelius's tail twitched in sympathetic exasperation.

The boy was a disaster.

Below, the Festival Market sprawled across Harbor Square in its full evening glory. Lanterns hung from every stall and awning, their warm light competing with the temporary enchantments that made certain vendor displays glow with soft colors. Music drifted from three different directions at once—a flute, a stringed instrument Cornelius could not identify, and someone attempting to sing while extremely drunk. The crowd moved in chaotic currents between the stalls, laughing and haggling and consuming an alarming quantity of fried food.

Cornelius had positioned himself with a clear view of the central fountain and the tile artist's stall on the market's western edge. From this elevation, he could observe without being observed. Track movement. Note behavioral patterns.

And, if necessary, intervene if Zeph did something catastrophically stupid.

He told himself this was purely investigative. Sophia Doukas was the last name on his revised suspect list. Daughter of the Doukas tile guild. An artist with access to expensive materials and wealthy clients. She had been near the Sea View Guest House the morning after the theft—sketching on that terrace, close enough to have heard or seen something relevant.

She required elimination from the investigation.

That was the official justification.

The unofficial truth, which Cornelius would not acknowledge even to himself, was that Zeph had looked genuinely anxious when he left the library earlier. Not his usual casual nervousness. Something deeper. More fragile.

And Cornelius had already cost him one meeting with this girl.

So. Here he was. On a roof. Freezing his scales off. Watching a date.

For investigative purposes.

Obviously.

Movement near the fountain. A young woman approached, her silhouette resolving into familiar features as she stepped into a pool of lantern light.

Sophia Doukas.

Cornelius's vision sharpened. She was shorter than Zeph by several inches, with dark hair pulled back in a practical braid. She wore an artist's apron over her dress—canvas, stained with what looked like tile glaze and ground pigment. Her hands moved constantly, either adjusting the strap of the leather satchel across her shoulder or gesturing as she spoke.

Zeph straightened when he saw her. Then slouched. Then straightened again, as if he could not decide which posture conveyed the appropriate level of casual confidence.

Cornelius resisted the urge to put his face in his claws.

"You came," Zeph said. His voice carried clearly in the evening air.

"I said I would." Sophia stopped a polite distance away. Not cold. Not warm. Evaluating. "Callista said you were looking for me earlier."

"Yeah. I mean, yes. I wanted to—about last night—I am sorry. I did not mean to—" Zeph stopped, took a breath, tried again. "There was an emergency at the library. My boss triggered a lockdown. I got trapped inside."

"A lockdown." Sophia's tone suggested skepticism.

"Code Obsidian. Full magical seal. No one in or out." Zeph gestured vaguely toward the library district. "Ask anyone at the Watch. Captain Theo had to respond personally. It was a whole thing."

Sophia studied him for a moment. Then her expression softened slightly. "That sounds... complicated."

"It was." Zeph's shoulders relaxed a fraction. "But it is over now. And I am here. Now. On time."

"You are."

"So. Um." Zeph gestured toward the market. "Do you want to... I mean, we could look at the stalls? Or get something to eat? There is a vendor selling those honey cakes you mentioned—"

"Actually," Sophia said, "I wanted to show you something. If you are interested."

"Yes. Absolutely. Whatever you want."

She smiled then. Small but genuine. "Come on."

They moved into the market together, navigating between stalls with the ease of locals who knew how to avoid the worst of the crush. Cornelius tracked their progress from above, moving along the roofline with the silent precision of a hunting cat.

His investigative instincts catalogued details automatically. Sophia carried herself with confidence. No furtive glances. No nervous energy. Her satchel hung loose at her side, bulging with what looked like sketchbooks and tools but not obviously concealing anything journal-sized.

She led Zeph to a stall near the market's edge, away from the densest foot traffic. The display table held samples of decorative tiles arranged in careful patterns. Each piece caught the lantern light differently—some with glossy glazes, others with matte finishes that seemed to absorb illumination entirely.

"This is my guild's stall," Sophia said. "Well. My family's part of the guild. We specialize in light-reactive glazes."

Zeph leaned closer, examining the tiles. "They change color?"

"Not exactly. They interact with different wavelengths of light. See this one?" She picked up a tile with a pale blue glaze. "In direct flame-light, it looks almost white. But under moon-glow or enchantment-light, the blues intensify. It is about understanding refraction. Particle suspension in the glaze matrix."

"That is..." Zeph touched the tile's edge carefully. "That is really complicated."

"It is science pretending to be art." Sophia set the tile down and selected another—this one a deep amber that seemed to glow from within. "Or art pretending to be science. I am not sure which."

"Can you do both?"

She looked at him. Something shifted in her expression. "Most people do not ask that."

"Why not?"

"Because they assume art and science are opposites. That you have to choose." She returned the amber tile to its place. "But my guild has been making light-reactive glazes for three generations. The chemistry is what makes the beauty possible. You cannot separate them."

"Like books," Zeph said.

Sophia tilted her head. "How?"

"The library. Boss—my boss, Cornelius—he is always going on about how the binding affects the longevity of the text. And the paper chemistry. And the ink composition. All this science stuff that makes the words last." Zeph gestured vaguely. "I used to think he was just being difficult. But then I saw him restore a water-damaged manuscript. And the way he talks about it... it is not just fixing a book. It is understanding how all the pieces work together. Paper and thread and glue and magic."

Up on the roof, Cornelius went very still.

The boy had been listening.

Sophia smiled. A real smile this time, reaching her eyes. "Chaos and glass."

"What?"

"Something my mother says. The art is in balancing chaos and glass. The chaos of the kiln—heat and time and chemical reactions you can only partially control. And the glass itself, which wants to be ordered. Stable. Clear." She picked up another tile, running her thumb along its edge. "You have to respect both."

"I like that," Zeph said quietly.

They stood together in comfortable silence for a moment, examining tiles. The market noise continued around them—haggling and laughter and music—but the space between Sophia and Zeph had developed its own quieter atmosphere.

Cornelius observed from above, his analytical mind processing the interaction. This was not the behavior of a criminal. Sophia's body language was open. Her conversation genuine. She showed no signs of deception or evasion.

But patterns could be misleading. He had learned that lesson recently.

Facts. He needed facts.

"Can I ask you something?" Zeph said.

"Of course."

"The perfumer. Kyriakos Vlahos. Do you know him?"

Sophia's expression changed immediately. The warmth drained from her face, replaced by something sharper. "Everyone knows him. Why?"

"He came to the library this morning. Had a conversation with Cornelius. It was... weird."

"Weird how?"

"He offered money. For access to rare books. Like he wanted to buy them. Or borrow them privately." Zeph's hands moved through his hair, disrupting the pomade's work. "Cornelius refused. Obviously. But the whole thing felt wrong. Like Kyriakos was used to people saying yes."

"He is." Sophia set down the tile with deliberate care. "My family has dealt with him before. Three years ago, my uncle developed a new iridescent glaze formula. Something no one else had managed—a finish that shifts through seven different colors depending on viewing angle. Completely revolutionary."

"What happened?"

"Kyriakos commissioned a private batch. Paid well. Signed a contract agreeing the formula would remain proprietary to our guild." Sophia's jaw tightened. "Six months later, a competitor in Khariton started producing tiles with an almost identical finish. Turns out Kyriakos had sketched the process while visiting our workshop. Took notes on the materials and firing temperatures. Then sold the information to the highest bidder."

"That is—he cannot do that. That is theft."

"It is. But proving it legally is complicated. Trade secrets. Intellectual property. He claimed he was simply 'inspired' by our work." Sophia's fingers drummed against the table edge. "My uncle tried to take him to the guild arbitrators. But Kyriakos has more money than we do. Better lawyers. The case went nowhere."

"That is horrible."

"It is business." Sophia's voice carried a bitterness that aged her. "He collects beautiful things. And he does not care who he hurts to get them."

Up on the roof, Cornelius's claws scraped against the tiles.

Kyriakos Vlahos. Thief of intellectual property. Seller of proprietary information to competitors.

A collector who did not care about consequences.

The perfumer had an alibi for the morning of the theft. His timeline had checked out. But what if he had not acted personally? What if he had commissioned someone else to acquire Dr. Floros's research? Hired a proxy to steal knowledge he could then sell to interested parties?

It was possible.

But it was also speculation. Pattern-building without evidence. Exactly the mistake Cornelius had made with Brother Demos.

He forced himself to remain still. To observe. To gather facts.

Below, Zeph and Sophia had moved away from the tile stall. They walked together through the market, stopping occasionally to examine vendor displays. Zeph bought two skewers of roasted vegetables from a cart. They ate while walking, the conversation continuing in fragments Cornelius could not quite hear over the ambient noise.

He followed from above, moving along the roofline with practiced silence. His wings remained folded tight against his sides—not for flight, but for balance as he navigated the uneven surfaces.

The couple turned down a quieter side street, away from the thickest market crowds. Sophia led them to a bench near a small plaza where someone had hung paper lanterns from the surrounding balconies.

"I was painting when it happened," Sophia said, picking up a conversation thread Cornelius had missed. "At the Widow's Perch. That cliff overlook on the southern point."

"When what happened?" Zeph asked.

"The theft you mentioned. Dr. Floros's journal." Sophia settled onto the bench, pulling her sketchbook from her satchel. "Everyone is talking about it. A visiting scholar, robbed during Festival. Poor woman."

Cornelius went absolutely still.

"You heard about that?" Zeph's voice had gone carefully neutral.

"My mother mentioned it. She knows someone at the Sea View Guest House." Sophia opened the sketchbook, flipping through pages. "It happened the morning after Festival Eve, right? I was at the cliffs from sunrise until almost noon. Trying to capture the way the light hits the rock face during morning hours. I am working on a series of tiles inspired by coastal geology."

An alibi.

Unprompted. Casual. Verifiable.

"Did you see anyone else there?" Zeph asked. "At the cliffs?"

"The hermit. Orestes. He yelled at me for getting too close to some tide pool." Sophia did not look up from her sketches. "Charming man. Very welcoming."

"He lives out there?"

"Apparently. In a cave or a shack or something equally uncomfortable." She found the page she wanted and turned the sketchbook toward Zeph. "Here. This is what I was working on."

Cornelius could not see the sketch from his position. But he could see Zeph's face as he examined it. The boy's expression shifted—surprise, then something like awe.

"This is really good," Zeph said quietly.

"Thank you."

"No, I mean—this is *really* good. The detail. The way you captured the texture of the stone." He traced a finger near the page's edge, careful not to touch the drawing itself. "It looks real. Like I could reach in and feel the rock."

"That is the goal." Sophia's voice had gone soft. "To translate the physical world into something two-dimensional but still... true."

"Like preserving it," Zeph said. "Keeping something that would otherwise be lost."

She looked at him then. Really looked, as if seeing him properly for the first time. "Yes. Exactly like that."

They sat together in the lantern-light, passing the sketchbook back and forth. Sophia explained her process. Zeph asked questions that were, Cornelius grudgingly admitted, actually intelligent. The conversation flowed naturally now, the earlier awkwardness dissolved.

On the roof above, Cornelius made his calculations.

Sophia Doukas had been at the Widow's Perch cliffs during the theft. Far from the Sea View Guest House. Witnessed by Orestes the hermit—admittedly not the most reliable source, but a witness nonetheless.

Her satchel contained sketchbooks and drawing tools. Pencils. Charcoal sticks. A small ruler. No brown leather journal with pressed flowers on the cover.

Cornelius's heat-sense confirmed it. He could detect the thermal signatures of everything in that bag from here. Paper gave off a distinctive pattern—cool and flat. Large volumes had more mass. More density.

No journal.

And her behavior displayed none of the markers he associated with deception. No evasiveness. No calculated misdirection. She had mentioned the theft casually, in the context of local gossip. She had provided an alibi without being asked.

She was innocent.

Pattern confirmed by evidence.

Dr. Floros's journal had been stolen between seven and nine bells on Festival morning. Sophia had been painting at the cliffs—a location that required at least an hour's walk from the harbor district. Even if she had somehow learned about the journal's existence and value, she could not have physically committed the theft.

Cornelius felt something unknot in his chest.

One more name crossed off the list.

Which left...

Brother Demos. Temple scholar with proven interest in botanical texts. Caught in the library after hours. Still the most logical suspect despite Captain Theo's skepticism.

And now, unexpectedly: Orestes. The hermit who lived at the cliffs. Who had been present near Sophia that morning. Who had access to tide pools and coastal plants. Who might have knowledge of rare botanical specimens.

A man who lived outside society's normal structures. Who operated without oversight.

Cornelius's mind began constructing a new pattern. Orestes could have learned about the Moon-Scented Orchid through his own observations of coastal flora. He might have known Dr. Floros was in town and targeted her specifically for the journal. A hermit would have climbing skills. Knowledge of back alleys and service routes.

It fit.

Almost.

But Cornelius had learned caution. Patterns were not evidence. Logic was not proof.

He would need to investigate Orestes properly. Gather facts. Verify the timeline.

Tomorrow.

Below, Zeph and Sophia had stood. They walked back toward the main market, still talking. The ease between them had solidified into something that looked almost like friendship. Perhaps more than friendship, based on the way Sophia's hand brushed Zeph's arm when she laughed.

Cornelius watched them disappear into the Festival crowds.

His work here was done.

Sophia: eliminated.

The suspect list: reduced to two.

He stood carefully on the roof tiles, shaking salt grit from his claws. His wings ached from being folded so long. His scales felt grimy. He wanted tea. And his desk. And the familiar comfort of his organized investigation notes.

But first, he needed to return to the library and update his records.

Facts, not patterns.

Evidence, not assumptions.

He would solve this properly.

Starting with Orestes the hermit.

Tomorrow.

Cornelius spread his wings and glided down from the roof, landing in a shadowed alley with practiced silence. The Festival noise covered any sound. No one saw a small bronze dragon slip through the back streets toward the library district.

Inside his mind, the investigation reshuffled itself. New priority. New focus.

A hermit who yelled at artists for approaching tide pools. Who lived alone at the cliffs. Who might know more about coastal plants than any temple scholar.

Cornelius's claws clicked against the cobblestones as he walked.

The Hunt had narrowed.

And he knew exactly where to look next.
