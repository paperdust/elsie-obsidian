# Chapter 8

The wind tried to murder him.

Cornelius clung to the limestone outcropping with all four sets of claws, wings folded tight against the gusts that wanted to peel him from the cliff face like old parchment. Salt spray coated his scales. His spectacles had fogged twice already. His tail wrapped around a twisted root for additional purchase.

This was undignified.

Also dangerous.

Also completely necessary, because Orestes the hermit lived at the very top of the Widow's Perch, apparently as a personal challenge to anyone foolish enough to seek him out.

Cornelius's wings ached. He had glided most of the distance from the library district, using the thermal currents that rose from the harbor. But the final approach required actual climbing. The cliff face was nearly vertical here, pocked with handholds that crumbled under pressure and slick with moisture from the constant spray.

He had not climbed like this in decades.

His shoulders would punish him for it later.

One more ledge. The summit was visible above—a flat expanse of weathered stone dotted with hardy scrub grass and twisted trees that had learned to grow sideways under the relentless coastal wind.

Cornelius dug his claws into a crack, tested his weight, and hauled himself upward.

His back leg slipped.

For one heart-stopping moment, he dangled by three limbs over a drop that would very definitely kill him. Library Dragons were many things. Durable against falls from great heights was not among them.

He scrabbled, found purchase, and pulled himself onto the ledge with a grunt of effort that no one—absolutely no one—could ever learn about.

The summit spread before him.

It was worse than he had imagined.

The Widow's Perch deserved its name. The promontory jutted out over empty air like an accusing finger, surrounded on three sides by sheer drops to the rocks and tide pools below. The stone here was pale gray, scoured smooth by centuries of wind. Patches of lichen clung to the surface in rust-colored smears. The scrub grass grew in defiant clumps, roots anchored in cracks barely wider than Cornelius's claws.

And at the far end, where the cliff face met a tumble of boulders, stood a structure that might generously be called a shelter.

It was made of driftwood. And stones. And what looked like dried kelp woven into some approximation of a roof. The whole thing leaned at an angle that suggested either architectural incompetence or a complete disregard for basic engineering principles.

Possibly both.

Cornelius approached cautiously, his scales prickling with awareness. The wind made it impossible to hear properly. Every sound was distorted, filtered through the constant rush of air and the distant crash of waves against stone far below.

"Orestes," he called. His voice barely carried. "I am Cornelius Drake, Head Librarian of Solterra Bay. I require a moment of your time."

No response.

The shelter remained silent.

Cornelius's ear-frills swiveled, tracking for movement. Nothing. Just wind and stone and the skeletal trees bending under the gusts.

He took another step forward.

"I am investigating a theft. You were present at this location two mornings past when—"

"I know why you are here, Lizard."

The voice came from behind him.

Cornelius spun, claws scraping stone.

A figure stood near the cliff edge. Exactly where there had been empty space a moment before.

Orestes.

The hermit was... difficult to describe. Human-shaped, certainly. But the edges blurred. His skin had the texture of bark—rough and ridged, with patterns that looked less like wrinkles and more like growth rings. His hair was not hair at all, but a tangle of thin branches and dried leaves that moved independently of the wind. His eyes were the color of deep moss, with no visible whites.

Dryad-touched, Cornelius's analytical mind catalogued. Significant integration. Possibly seventy percent plant matter.

The hermit wore robes that might once have been gray but had faded to the same color as the lichen on the stones. His feet were bare. His toes had roots.

Actual roots.

They extended into the stone itself, anchored in cracks Cornelius had not noticed before.

"You are Orestes," Cornelius said. It was not a question.

"I am the Thorn. The Watcher. The one who tends what should not be tended and guards what should not need guarding." The hermit's voice had layers—human speech overlaid with something that sounded like wind through leaves. "You are the Hoarder of Dead Words. The Keeper of Pressed Truths. The one who thinks knowledge lives in cages."

Cornelius's tail lashed. "I prefer 'librarian.'"

"Of course you do." Orestes moved closer. His roots withdrew from the stone with a sound like tearing fabric, then extended again with each step, re-anchoring. "The girl told me you would come. The one who paints stones. She said the Lizard was asking questions about thieves and scholars and stolen things."

"Sophia Doukas spoke to you?"

"She shouted at me after I shouted at her. A fair exchange." The hermit stopped three paces away, his moss-eyes fixed on Cornelius with unsettling intensity. "She was standing too close to the eastern pools. Disturbing the anemones. I informed her she was unwelcome."

"She mentioned that."

"Did she mention what I told her about the False Gardener?"

Cornelius went still. "No. She did not."

Orestes smiled. It was not a comforting expression. His teeth were wooden.

"Then you are here for answers you do not yet know to ask." The hermit turned and moved toward the cliff edge, roots sliding across stone. "Come, Lizard. See what has been violated."

Every instinct Cornelius possessed screamed that following a territorial hermit to the edge of a deadly precipice was a poor life choice.

But he had come here for information.

Facts, not patterns. Evidence, not assumptions.

He followed.

Orestes led him to a spot where the summit's edge curved inward, creating a small alcove sheltered from the worst of the wind. Below, tide pools spread across the exposed rock shelf, their surfaces reflecting the sky in broken fragments. Seaweed draped over boulders in dark ribbons. Small creatures moved in the shallow water—crabs and snails and things Cornelius could not identify from this height.

"There," Orestes said, pointing downward.

Cornelius peered over the edge, his claws digging into stone for stability.

At first, he saw nothing unusual. Just tide pools. Stone. The eternal cycle of water and rock.

Then he noticed the disturbance.

One of the larger pools—near the base of the cliff, accessible only at low tide—had been disturbed recently. The seaweed around its edges was torn. Rocks had been moved, creating a small cleared area. And in the center, barely visible from this angle, something had been scraped into the stone itself.

Measurement marks.

Someone had been documenting the pool's dimensions.

"When?" Cornelius asked.

"Three days past. In the hour before dawn." Orestes's branches rustled despite the relative calm of the alcove. "I heard the scraping. Came down to investigate. Found a man with tools. Measuring. Recording. Violating."

"Did you speak to him?"

"I told him to leave. He ignored me. Told me he was engaged in 'important scientific work' and that I should mind my own affairs." The hermit's voice had gone cold. Wooden. "I was going to throw him from the cliff. But he climbed away quickly. Like a spider. Unnatural."

Cornelius's mind raced. Someone measuring tide pools. Three days ago—the same timeframe as the theft. Someone with climbing skills and scientific interests.

Brother Demos?

"Describe him," Cornelius said.

"Human. Male. Wearing robes. Gray, like temple cloth. He smelled wrong."

"Wrong how?"

"Sweet. False-sweet. Like crushed flowers left to rot in sugar." Orestes turned his moss-eyes to Cornelius. "Like something beautiful turned poison."

Synthetic musk.

The perfume.

Kyriakos No. 5.

Cornelius's scales prickled. "You are certain about the scent?"

"I am of the earth, Lizard. I know every smell that belongs here and every smell that does not. That smell does not belong anywhere living things grow." The hermit's roots dug deeper into the stone. "It clings to death. To preservation. To things kept past their time."

The pieces clicked together in Cornelius's mind.

Brother Demos. Temple robes. Scientific interests. Present at the cliffs before dawn, measuring tide pools—exactly the kind of preparation someone would need to locate the Moon-Scented Orchid.

And wearing Kyriakos No. 5.

The same scent detected at Dr. Floros's room.

Pattern confirmed by evidence.

"Did he carry anything?" Cornelius asked. "A bag? A journal?"

"A satchel. Brown leather. He clutched it like a child clutches a stolen sweet." Orestes's branches stirred. "I assumed it held his measuring tools. His instruments of violation."

A brown leather satchel.

The journal.

Cornelius's certainty solidified. Brother Demos had been here, at the cliffs, with Dr. Floros's stolen research. The monk had taken the journal, learned about the Orchid's location, and come to survey the site himself. All the evidence pointed to—

"But he did not steal words, Lizard."

Cornelius blinked. "What?"

"The man you seek. The one who violated the pools." Orestes turned fully to face him, roots and all. "He did not steal pressed words. He did not take knowledge bound in dead tree flesh. He could not have."

"How do you know?"

"Because I know what he seeks. And it is not your hoard of dried truths." The hermit's wooden teeth showed again. "He seeks the living truth. The one that blooms once in fifty years. The Moon-Scented Orchid."

Cornelius went very still.

Orestes knew about the Orchid.

"You are aware of its existence," Cornelius said carefully.

"I am its Watcher. As my mother before me. As her mother before her." The hermit's voice carried the weight of roots going deep. "The Orchid is not for cages, Lizard. Not for books. Not for bottles or vials or any container made by hands that think beauty can be owned."

"Someone stole Dr. Floros's research journal. It contained maps to the Orchid's location."

"Then they sought to bottle truth. To cage beauty. To claim what cannot be claimed." Orestes's branches rattled like dry bones. "The False Gardener comes. I have seen the signs. Smelled his poisoned sweetness on the wind. He will try to take the bloom. To preserve it. To keep it past its time."

"Who is the False Gardener?"

"The one who wears death as decoration. Who collects beauty like your kind collects words. Who thinks rarity increases worth." The hermit leaned closer. "He smells of musk and lies, Lizard. And he will come when the moon is full and the tide is low and the Orchid opens its throat to sing."

Kyriakos.

The perfumer was the False Gardener.

The pattern had always been there. The collector who stole proprietary formulas. Who valued beauty only when it could be possessed. Who had the wealth to hire proxies, to commission theft, to—

"But this does not concern your investigation," Orestes said, interrupting Cornelius's racing thoughts. "You seek a thief of paper. I cannot help you with that. I do not read. I do not write. I would sooner burn pressed words than keep them."

Cornelius forced himself to focus. "The man at the tide pools. Are you certain he wore temple robes?"

"Gray cloth. Simple cut. Like monks wear."

"And the brown leather satchel—"

"—held his tools. His measuring devices. Not your stolen truth." Orestes's roots began withdrawing from the stone. "I am done with questions, Lizard. The wind grows restless. You should leave before it decides you are light enough to carry."

"Wait. The Orchid—when does it bloom?"

"Tomorrow night. When the moon is full and the tide retreats." The hermit was already moving away, back toward his impossible shelter. "The False Gardener will come then. If you wish to stop him, you must move quickly."

"How do you know he will come?"

Orestes paused. Looked back.

"Because he already has the map."

The words hung in the wind.

Cornelius's mind reeled.

Kyriakos had the journal. Or someone working for him did. The perfumer had commissioned the theft, hired Brother Demos—or someone dressed as a monk—to steal Dr. Floros's research and survey the cliffs.

Tomorrow night, Kyriakos would come to harvest the Orchid.

To bottle something that bloomed once every fifty years.

To own it. Possess it. Turn it into expensive perfume for people who would never understand its true value.

The same way he had stolen the Doukas guild's glaze formula. The same way he had tried to buy access to the library's rare texts.

A collector who saw beauty only as property.

Cornelius's claws scraped stone.

"You must tell Dr. Floros," Orestes called from near his shelter. "Tell her the Watcher keeps faith. Tell her the Orchid will bloom as it has always bloomed. But tell her to come quickly, if she wishes to witness it. Before the False Gardener bottles its soul."

Then the hermit stepped into his driftwood structure and seemed to merge with it entirely. Cornelius could no longer distinguish where plant ended and person began.

He was alone on the Widow's Perch.

The wind howled.

Cornelius turned and made his way back across the summit, his mind processing everything he had learned.

Facts:

Brother Demos—or someone wearing temple robes—had been at the tide pools three days ago, measuring and documenting. Wearing Kyriakos No. 5 perfume. Carrying a brown leather satchel.

The same perfume detected at Dr. Floros's room.

The same type of satchel Demos carried in the library.

But Orestes insisted the man at the cliffs was not stealing books. Could not have stolen books, because he sought the living Orchid, not pressed knowledge.

Which meant...

Cornelius stopped at the edge of the summit, where the climb down would begin.

Which meant the pattern was incomplete.

Again.

Brother Demos could have stolen the journal. He had the opportunity. The interest in botanical texts. The presence in the library after hours with a brown leather bag.

But the evidence was circumstantial. No proof. No direct observation. Just patterns that seemed to fit.

Patterns were not facts.

And Cornelius had already been wrong once.

Spectacularly, humiliatingly wrong.

His claws flexed against the stone.

The truth was maddeningly close. He could feel it. Someone had stolen Dr. Floros's journal. Someone with access to expensive perfume, climbing skills, and knowledge of coastal plants. Someone who had surveyed the cliffs and now planned to harvest the Orchid.

Kyriakos had motive. Wealth. A documented history of stealing intellectual property and rare materials.

But he had an alibi for the morning of the theft.

Brother Demos had opportunity. Interest. Suspicious behavior.

But no proven connection to Kyriakos or the Orchid harvest.

Unless...

Unless Demos was working for Kyriakos.

A hired agent. A proxy thief. Someone paid to steal the journal, scout the location, and report back to the perfumer.

It fit.

It fit perfectly.

But Cornelius had thought that before. About other suspects. Other patterns.

Facts, not patterns.

Evidence, not assumptions.

He needed proof.

He needed to search Brother Demos's quarters at the temple. To find the journal. Or correspondence with Kyriakos. Or anything that would transform suspicion into certainty.

But temple law protected monks' privacy. The head priest had refused Cornelius's earlier request for access. Captain Theo would never approve a search without concrete evidence—which Cornelius did not have.

Official channels had failed.

Which left unofficial channels.

Cornelius stood on the cliff edge, wings catching the wind, and made his decision.

He would break temple law.

Tonight, while the monks were at evening prayers, he would enter Brother Demos's quarters. He would search methodically. Document everything. Find the evidence that would prove the connection between Demos and Kyriakos.

It was illegal.

It was everything Captain Theo had warned him against.

It was the only way forward.

The wind gusted, nearly pushing Cornelius over the edge. He spread his wings and let it carry him into the air, gliding down from the Widow's Perch in a controlled descent that used the cliff's thermal currents.

His wings ached.

His scales were crusted with salt.

His mind was already planning the intrusion.

Tomorrow night, the Orchid would bloom.

Tomorrow night, Kyriakos would come to steal it.

But tonight, Cornelius would find proof.

And he would stop this. All of it.

Order would be restored.

Even if he had to break every rule he believed in to achieve it.

The library appeared below, its honey-colored stone a welcome sight after the hostile gray of the Perch. Cornelius angled toward it, adjusting his wings for landing.

He had a case to solve.

And less than two days to solve it.

The Hunt continued.
