# Chapter 1

"Seventeen," Cornelius muttered, adjusting his spectacles with one bronze claw. "Eighteen. Nineteen."

The books stood in their proper formation along the shelf, spines aligned with mathematical precision. He tilted his head, peering through the gold-rimmed lenses at the embossed titles. Each volume was exactly where it belonged, sorted by author, then subject, then acquisition date. The system was flawless. The system was *his*.

He extended one wing for balance and reached for the twentieth spine. His talons closed around the leather binding with the careful grip of long practice. One advantage of being a Library Dragon rather than the traditional gold-hoarding variety: books did not require the same delicate touch as ancient coins. They were sturdy. Reliable. They stayed where one put them.

"Twenty," he said, and made a neat tick mark in his ledger.

The afternoon inventory proceeded exactly as it should. The Festival of Twinkle Nights roared somewhere beyond the library's thick stone walls—a cacophony of drums, flutes, and entirely too many humans shouting about beetle migrations—but here, in the cool dimness of the Reference Collection, order prevailed. Dust motes hung motionless in the air. The marble floor gleamed, recently polished. Every shelf label faced outward at the regulation angle.

Cornelius permitted himself a small curl of satisfaction in his chest, the draconic equivalent of a purr. This was as it should be. This was *correct*.

He moved to the next shelf and began again. "One. Two. Three."

The library had been his life's work for the better part of a century. Other dragons hoarded gold, or gems, or the bones of their enemies. Cornelius had always found such pursuits tedious. Gold simply sat there, glittering stupidly. It did not organize itself. It did not require cataloging, or preservation, or careful climate control. It was, in his professional opinion, terribly boring.

But books. Books were a hoard worthy of intelligence.

"Four. Five. Six."

The Collection of Botanical Texts occupied the third tier of shelving in the western gallery, accessible only by ladder or flight. Cornelius preferred flight. Ladders were designed for beings with legs of equal length, and his hind legs were notably shorter than his forelegs. The resulting wobble was simply unacceptable.

He spread his wings and glided up to the seventh shelf with barely a whisper of displaced air. His claws clicked softly against the stone ledge as he landed. Excellent. Shelf Seven, Row B: Agricultural Practices and Permaculture. Twelve volumes, if memory served.

"One. Two. Three. Four."

A door slammed somewhere in the depths of the building. Cornelius's ear-frills twitched in irritation. That would be the Intern, returning from his lunch break. Late, no doubt. The boy had been increasingly distracted this week, forever smoothing his hair or checking his reflection in the brass door plates. It was deeply inefficient.

Footsteps echoed up from the main hall—rapid, uneven, and accompanied by the unmistakable sound of someone eating something flaky. Cornelius closed his eyes and counted silently to ten. He would not lose his temper. He would not incinerate the phyllo pastry. He would maintain his composure and simply remind the boy, yet again, that food was not permitted within five meters of the archival materials.

"Five. Six. Seven."

"Hey, Boss!"

Cornelius's talons clenched reflexively around the spine of *Agricultural Wisdom of the Northern Plains*. He took a slow breath and turned his head to peer down at the main floor. 

The Intern stood at the base of the ladder, one hand cupped beneath a spanakopita that was shedding its outer layers with the enthusiasm of a molting griffin. Phyllo flakes drifted downward in a lazy spiral, glinting as they fell. Three of them landed on the polished marble. One landed on the circulation desk. Another appeared to be lodged in the boy's hair.

"Zephyr," Cornelius said, keeping his voice perfectly level. "If a single crumb of that monstrosity touches the First Edition Compendium, I shall feel compelled to file you under Hazardous Waste."

Zeph looked down at his pastry, then at the crumbs, then back up at Cornelius. His expression suggested he had only just now considered the possibility that food might shed. "Uh. Want me to—"

"Eat. Outside."

"But I just—"

"*Outside*."

The boy's shoulders slumped. He turned and slouched toward the door, trailing phyllo like a particularly inefficient refugee from a bakery explosion. Cornelius waited until the door clicked shut before returning to his count.

"Seven," he repeated. "Eight. Nine."

The interruption had disrupted his rhythm. He paused, closed his eyes, and reconstructed the mental image of the shelf. Row B. Agricultural Practices. He had counted nine, which meant three remained. He opened his eyes and continued.

"Ten. Eleven."

His claw reached for the twelfth volume.

The space was empty.

Cornelius blinked. He adjusted his spectacles. The space remained empty.

He leaned closer, bringing his snout within an inch of the gap. The dust pattern on the shelf showed a clear rectangular outline where a book had rested for years. The volumes on either side leaned inward slightly, as though their missing neighbor had only recently departed. He sniffed cautiously. No scent of mold or decay. The book had not crumbled. It had been removed.

A cold prickle of wrongness ran down his spine.

Books did not simply vanish. Not in his library. Not under his watch.

He pulled back and consulted his ledger, flipping to the inventory master list with quick, precise movements. His claw traced down the entries for Shelf Seven, Row B.

*Position Twelve: "Secret Wonders: Field notes on medicinal herbs of the coastal regions," Author: Anonymous. Leather binding, brown. Acquired Year 384. Last verified: Spring Inventory, Day Fifteen.*

His eyes narrowed. Spring Inventory had been six weeks ago. The book had been *here*. He distinctly remembered checking it. He remembered the scuffed corner of the binding and the faint water stain on the bottom edge. He remembered everything about his hoard.

And now it was gone.

Cornelius descended from the shelf in a controlled glide, landing on the circulation desk with barely a sound. His mind spun through possibilities. Mis-shelved? Unlikely. He had personally organized this section. Borrowed and not returned? Impossible. He tracked every loan with obsessive precision. Stolen?

His chest went cold.

No. Not stolen. That was absurd. Who would steal a book from *his* library? Everyone knew that crossing a Library Dragon was an excellent way to spend the rest of one's natural life banned from all written materials within a fifty-mile radius. He had a reputation. He had *standards*.

The book had to be somewhere. Mis-filed, perhaps, by the Intern during one of his rare attempts at helpfulness. The boy meant well, but his organizational skills were catastrophically human.

The front door opened. Zeph returned, pointedly empty-handed, and made a show of brushing crumbs off his tunic. "All clean, Boss. Can I come back in now, or do I need to pass a phyllo inspection?"

Cornelius ignored the sarcasm. "Zephyr. The volume *Secret Wonders*. Brown leather, botanical field notes. Have you re-shelved it recently?"

The boy blinked. "Uh. Which one is that?"

"Shelf Seven, Row B, Position Twelve."

"Man, I don't know the position numbers. You know I don't know the position numbers." Zeph wandered over to the returns cart and poked at the stack of books waiting to be processed. "What's it look like?"

"Brown. Leather. Approximately twenty centimeters tall. Water stain on the bottom edge."

"Doesn't ring a bell." Zeph picked up a book from the cart, squinted at it, then set it down in a slightly different position. Cornelius felt his left eye twitch. "Is it important?"

"Every book in this collection is important."

"Yeah, but like, *important* important? Or just regular important?"

Cornelius opened his mouth to deliver a lecture on the equal value of all knowledge, then stopped. The boy was watching him with an odd expression—half curious, half distracted. There was a faint bronze sheen to his dark hair where it caught the light from the reading lamps. Lamassu ancestry, if Cornelius's memory of bloodlines served. The boy probably didn't even know. Most mixed-heritage humans didn't, these days.

And at this particular moment, the boy clearly did not care about missing books.

"Regular important," Cornelius said finally. "Return to your shelving duties."

Zeph nodded and turned back to the cart. Then he paused. His hand went to his hair, smoothing it down. His reflection appeared faintly in the polished brass of the nearest lamp fixture. He adjusted his collar.

Cornelius's eyes narrowed. "What are you doing?"

"Nothing."

"You are preening."

"I'm not—" Zeph's hand dropped. "I'm just, you know. Making sure I look okay."

"For the books?"

"For—" The boy's face flushed. "Never mind."

Ah. Of course. The date. Zeph had mentioned it approximately forty-seven times over the past three days. He was meeting Sophia Doukas, the tile artist's daughter, at the Festival tonight. Cornelius had listened to detailed descriptions of her eyes (brown), her smile (nice), and her skills with decorative glazework (apparently adequate). The boy was besotted.

And therefore useless for serious investigative work.

Cornelius measured his options. He could demand a full inventory of all recent patron activity. He could interview the cleaning staff. He could check the loan records going back six months.

Or he could do all of that tomorrow, after the wretched Festival ended and the town returned to a reasonable volume level.

The missing book bothered him. It bothered him deeply. But calling in Captain Theo and the Town Watch would mean opening the library to a full search. It would mean disrupting the careful order of the stacks. It would mean explaining to Theo—who had never forgiven him for the incident with the overdue municipal charter—that he had somehow *lost track* of one of his books.

The humiliation alone was unthinkable.

No. Better to wait. The book would turn up. It had to. Books did not simply cease to exist.

Cornelius picked up his ledger and made a careful notation: *Secret Wonders - Position Twelve - Status: MISPLACED. Follow up required.*

He underlined "MISPLACED" twice. Not stolen. Not missing. Misplaced.

The distinction mattered.

"Zephyr," he said, closing the ledger with a decisive snap. "I am going to complete the inventory of the Historical Documents section. You will continue processing returns. Do try not to destroy anything."

"Sure thing, Boss." Zeph was back to fussing with his hair. He had produced a small comb from somewhere and was attempting to tame a cowlick. "Hey, uh. Do you think this shirt is okay? Or should I change before I go?"

Cornelius looked at the shirt. It was blue. It had sleeves. It appeared to be free of phyllo.

"It is acceptable."

"Just acceptable?"

"It is a shirt, Zephyr. It performs its function adequately. I fail to see what more one could ask of it."

The boy sighed. "You're no help."

"I am a librarian, not a fashion consultant." Cornelius spread his wings and lifted off, gliding toward the Historical Documents alcove. Behind him, he heard Zeph mutter something that sounded suspiciously like "Yeah, no kidding."

He let it pass. The boy was nervous about his date. Nervous humans said inadvisable things. It was simply their nature.

The Historical Documents section occupied a climate-controlled alcove behind the main stacks. Cornelius had installed the enchantments himself—humidity regulation, pest wards, and a subtle preservation spell that kept the ink from fading. The oldest documents dated back four hundred years, to the founding of Solterra Bay itself. They were priceless. Irreplaceable.

And, he confirmed after a careful count, all present and accounted for.

"Forty-eight," he murmured, making the final tick mark. "Complete."

The relief was immediate. Whatever had happened to *Secret Wonders*, it was an isolated incident. Not an invasion. Not a systematic theft. Just one book, temporarily misplaced.

He could live with that.

For now.

Cornelius glided back to his office—a small room behind the circulation desk, cluttered with the comfortable debris of scholarship. His favorite reading chair sat in the corner, worn smooth by decades of use. His desk occupied the center of the room, covered in neat stacks of correspondence, acquisition requests, and catalog updates. And on the shelf above the desk, his personal collection gleamed: rare first editions, signed manuscripts, and one extremely illegal copy of *The Compleat Anatomy of Civic Government* that he had won in a card game.

He settled into his chair and reached for the teapot. Still warm. He poured himself a cup of mint tea, breathing in the sharp, clean scent.

Outside, the Festival grew louder. Drums thundered. Someone was singing off-key. Children shrieked with what he could only assume was delight. The entire town had lost its collective mind over a swarm of bioluminescent beetles that happened to migrate through the bay once a year. It was, in Cornelius's opinion, an excessive reaction to a minor entomological phenomenon.

But it kept the chaos *outside*, where it belonged.

He sipped his tea and opened the latest acquisition catalog. Three new collections had become available this month. One was promising—a set of natural philosophy texts from the University of Khariton. The other two were overpriced nonsense. He made notes in the margins with his smallest claw, marking items of interest.

Peaceful. Orderly. Exactly as an afternoon should be.

The door to the library rattled.

Cornelius looked up, ear-frills pricking forward. The rattling continued—not the gentle push of a patron trying the handle, but a frantic, uneven banging.

He set down his teacup.

The banging intensified. Someone was pounding on the door with both fists, hard enough that the frame shook. Between impacts, he heard a voice—female, breathless, and rising toward panic.

"Please! Is anyone there? *Please!*"

Zeph appeared in the doorway of the office, eyes wide. "Should I—"

"Yes." Cornelius was already moving, launching himself from the chair and gliding toward the main hall. "Open it."

The boy ran ahead and threw the bolt. The door swung inward.

A woman stumbled through, wild-eyed and gasping. Her gray hair had escaped its pins and hung in tangled wisps around her face. Her traveling cloak was askew, the hem dark with something that might have been mud or worse. She clutched at the doorframe, fighting for breath.

"The library," she panted. "Is this—I need—oh thank the gods."

Cornelius landed on the circulation desk and drew himself up to his full height. Which was, admittedly, not particularly impressive—he was roughly the size of a large cat—but he had learned that posture and authority could compensate for physical stature.

"Madam," he said crisply. "The library is closed for inventory. If you require—"

"No!" She lurched forward, reaching out as though to grab him, then seemed to remember herself. "No, please, you don't understand. I need your help. Someone has—they've taken—I don't know what to do."

Her voice cracked on the last word. Cornelius saw, with some alarm, that her hands were shaking.

Zeph stepped forward. "Hey, it's okay. Just take a breath. What happened?"

But Cornelius had already identified the woman. The silver hair, the ink-stained fingers, the leather satchel embroidered with botanical diagrams. He had seen her portrait in the University press, years ago, when she published her groundbreaking work on cliff-dwelling flora.

"Dr. Floros," he said.

She looked up at him, eyes bright with unshed tears. "You know me?"

"I know your work. *The Hidden Gardens of the Coastal Reach*. An excellent monograph." He paused. "You are a friend of Imelda's."

"Yes." She gripped the edge of the desk as though it were the only solid thing in the world. "Yes. Imelda Kassiani. She said—she told me if I ever needed help in Solterra Bay, I should come here. To the library. To you."

Cornelius felt something cold settle in his stomach. Imelda did not give that advice lightly. She was the Head Librarian, his colleague and—though he would never say it aloud—his closest friend. If she had sent someone to him, it was serious.

"Very well," he said. "Zephyr, fetch her a chair. And water. Dr. Floros, please sit."

She shook her head violently. "There's no time. It's gone. Someone's taken it, and if I don't get it back—" Her voice rose. "The Orchid blooms in three days. Three days! And without the journal, I can't—"

"Dr. Floros." Cornelius let a thread of command enter his voice. Not unkind, but firm. "Sit. Breathe. Then tell me, slowly and clearly, exactly what has been taken."

She stared at him. Then, slowly, she sank into the chair Zeph had pulled forward. The boy offered her a cup of water. She took it with trembling hands and drank.

When she spoke again, her voice was steadier. But the fear remained.

"My field journal," she said. "Someone has stolen my field journal."

Cornelius went very still.

"And in that journal," she continued, "is the only map to the Moon-Scented Orchid. The bloom happens once every fifty years. If I can't document it—if someone else finds it first—"

She didn't finish. She didn't need to.

Cornelius's mind was already racing, categorizing, analyzing. A theft. In his town. During the chaos of the Festival. A valuable document, containing irreplaceable data.

Someone had stolen a book.

His book sense tingled with outrage. His organizational instincts screamed for order to be restored. And beneath both, something else stirred—something predatory and sharp.

He had a case.

"Tell me everything," he said.
