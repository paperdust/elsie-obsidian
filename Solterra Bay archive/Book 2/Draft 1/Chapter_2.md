# Chapter 2

Dr. Floros gripped the cup of water with both hands, knuckles pale against the ceramic. A drop splashed onto her sleeve. She did not seem to notice.

Cornelius adjusted his spectacles and settled into a more comfortable position on the circulation desk, tail curled neatly around his haunches. He had asked her to tell him everything. Now he would listen, catalog, and determine whether this constituted an actual emergency or simply the sort of scholarly panic that erupted when humans misplaced their notes.

He suspected the latter. Dr. Floros had an excellent reputation for fieldwork, but her monograph on coastal flora had included three separate appendices correcting earlier chapters. The woman was brilliant but disorganized. The muddy hem of her cloak and the wild tangle of her hair suggested she had not improved with age.

"Start at the beginning," he said. "When did you last see the journal?"

"This morning." She set the cup down with a trembling hand. "I was reviewing my field notes at the Sea View Guest House. I had the journal on the writing desk. All my observations, all my maps—fifty years of research, consolidated and cross-referenced." Her voice cracked. "I went down to breakfast at eight bells. When I returned, the window was open and the journal was gone."

Cornelius's ear-frills pricked forward. "The window was closed when you left?"

"Yes. Latched. I'm certain of it."

"What floor?"

"Second."

He considered this. The Sea View Guest House backed onto a network of narrow service alleys. A reasonably fit human could scale to a second-floor window without much difficulty, particularly during Festival chaos when half the town was drunk on honey wine and the other half was attempting to herd bioluminescent beetles.

"Did you see anyone in the corridor? Hear anything unusual?"

"No. Nothing." Dr. Floros leaned forward. "But the journal is extremely valuable, Master Drake. Not just to me. The Moon-Scented Orchid blooms once every fifty years. *Once*. And it blooms for only three days before the petals close and the plant goes dormant again. If I cannot locate it—if someone else finds it first—"

"Yes, you mentioned." Cornelius kept his tone level. "The Orchid. Three days. I understand the urgency."

Though privately, he found the entire situation deeply inefficient. Why would anyone consolidate fifty years of irreplaceable research into a single physical journal? Any competent scholar would maintain duplicate records. Preferably in triplicate, stored in separate locations, with a master index cross-referencing all entries by subject, date, and geographical coordinates.

But he did not say this aloud. Dr. Floros looked approximately two minutes away from complete breakdown, and hysterical humans were notably difficult to interview.

"Describe the journal," he said instead. "Size, color, distinguishing features."

She blinked, as though surprised by the practicality of the question. "Leather-bound. Brown. Approximately this large." She held her hands apart to indicate a book perhaps twenty centimeters tall and fifteen wide. "The cover has a pressed flower design—a four-petaled blossom, gilded. The pages are handmade linen paper. My name is embossed on the inside cover in silver ink."

Cornelius went very still.

Twenty centimeters tall. Brown leather. 

Exactly the size and color of *Secret Wonders: Field notes on medicinal herbs of the coastal regions*.

The missing book from Shelf Seven, Row B, Position Twelve.

A cold, prickling sensation crawled down his spine. He forced himself to remain outwardly calm, tail still, wings folded. Two missing botanical texts. Both brown leather. Both containing field research on rare plants. Both vanishing during the chaos of the Festival.

That was not coincidence. That was pattern.

"When did you arrive in Solterra Bay?" he asked.

"Two days ago. I needed to resupply before the expedition into the highlands. The Orchid grows in a very specific microclimate—limestone cliffs with southern exposure, within audible range of the sea, sheltered from the prevailing winds..." She trailed off, shaking her head. "But that doesn't matter now. Without the map, I'll never find it in time. The highlands are vast. I could search for weeks and never—"

"Dr. Floros." Cornelius let a thread of command enter his voice. "Focus, please. Have you told anyone else about the theft?"

"I went to the Town Watch first. That dreadful man—Captain Theo—he barely listened. Said half the town reports something stolen during Festival, and most of it turns up in a tavern the next morning. He told me to come back tomorrow if it didn't 'magically reappear.'" Her hands clenched into fists. "As though my life's work is equivalent to a misplaced coin purse."

Cornelius felt a sharp flicker of indignation on her behalf. Typical Theo. The man had all the intellectual curiosity of a brick and the investigative instincts to match. No wonder he had never solved the mystery of the overdue municipal charter. He had probably filed it under "Misplaced" and moved on.

Not that Cornelius had done anything different with *Secret Wonders*.

He pushed the thought aside.

"So you came here," he said. "On Imelda's recommendation."

"Yes." Dr. Floros looked up at him, and for the first time, something other than panic showed in her eyes. "She said you were the most meticulous mind she had ever encountered. That if anyone could find a missing book, it was you." She hesitated. "She also said you were insufferably pedantic and would probably lecture me about proper archival practices."

Despite himself, Cornelius felt his spine straighten slightly. "Imelda is an excellent judge of character."

Behind him, Zeph made a strangled sound that might have been a suppressed laugh. Cornelius ignored him.

"Very well," he said. "I will take your case. But I require complete honesty and cooperation. No omissions. No assumptions. You will tell me everything you know, everything you saw, and everything you did today, in precise chronological order."

Dr. Floros nodded so hard her hair came loose from another pin. "Yes. Of course. Anything."

Cornelius flicked his tail in satisfaction. This was better. Order could be imposed on chaos, as long as one had accurate data.

"Begin with your morning routine," he said. "You woke at what time?"

"Seven bells. I ate breakfast in my room—tea and bread. I worked on my notes until—"

A scent cut through her words.

Cornelius's nostrils flared. It was faint, clinging to Dr. Floros's cloak and skin beneath the more obvious smells of road dust and fear-sweat. Sharp. Chemical. Artificial.

Synthetic musk.

He knew that smell. He had encountered it before, in books returned by patrons who shopped at the expensive perfumeries near the harbor. It was the olfactory equivalent of wearing a sign that read "I Have Disposable Income."

Dr. Floros did not strike him as the perfume type. She wore practical traveling clothes, sturdy boots, and no jewelry except a single wooden pendant carved in the shape of an oak leaf. Nothing about her suggested she dabbled in expensive fragrances.

So where had the scent come from?

Cornelius opened his mouth to ask, then stopped.

Dr. Floros was still talking, describing her breakfast in earnest detail. Zeph had fetched her a second cup of water and was hovering nearby with the awkward concern of someone who did not quite know what to do with a distressed middle-aged woman. The library was quiet except for the distant thrum of Festival drums.

And the scent was faint. Very faint. She could have brushed past someone wearing perfume in the corridor of the guest house, or in the crowded streets. Or the previous occupant of her room might have worn it, and the scent had lingered on the furniture.

It was a detail. Possibly irrelevant.

Cornelius filed it away and returned his attention to Dr. Floros's account.

"—and then I went downstairs," she was saying. "The common room was full. Half the town seemed to be eating breakfast there. I didn't recognize most of them, but the innkeeper's wife said something about Festival guests taking all the usual tables. I sat by the window and had more tea."

"How long were you downstairs?"

"Perhaps half an hour? The service was slow. Everyone was talking about the beetles and whether the migration would peak tonight or tomorrow. I was not paying close attention."

"And when you returned to your room?"

"The door was still locked. I used my key. But the window—" She gestured sharply. "Wide open. The curtains were flapping. And the journal was gone."

Cornelius's eyes narrowed. "The door was locked, but the window was open."

"Yes."

"Which suggests the thief entered and exited via the window, not the corridor."

"That's what I thought." Dr. Floros leaned forward. "Someone must have climbed up from the alley. But I searched the ground below. There were no footprints, no scuff marks on the wall. Nothing."

Interesting. Either the thief was exceptionally careful, or the alley had been too trafficked to preserve useful evidence. During Festival, both were equally plausible.

"Did you notice anyone watching you?" Cornelius asked. "Either yesterday or this morning. Someone taking unusual interest in your work."

Dr. Floros hesitated. "There was... a monk. Brother Demos, I think his name was. He approached me yesterday in the market. Said he had read my monograph and wanted to discuss the theological implications of cyclical plant life. Something about divine patterns in botanical growth cycles." She waved a hand dismissively. "I was polite but brief. I had supplies to purchase."

Cornelius's ear-frills pricked sharply forward. "Did you mention the Orchid to him?"

"No. Absolutely not. I've told no one except Imelda, and that was weeks ago in a sealed letter."

"Describe this Brother Demos."

"Tall. Thin. Very pale. He wore the gray robes of the temple scholars—the ones who study in the archives all day and never see sunlight." She frowned. "He seemed earnest. A little intense, perhaps. But not... I mean, I didn't think..."

She trailed off, looking miserable.

Cornelius felt a flicker of sympathy. Scholars were trusting by nature. They assumed others shared their reverence for knowledge. It made them excellent colleagues and terrible judges of character.

"Zephyr," he said, without turning his head. "Do you know Brother Demos?"

"Uh. Yeah." Zeph shifted his weight. "I mean, I know *of* him. He comes into the library sometimes. Reads the old theology texts. Keeps to himself."

"Has he requested access to the Botanical Collection?"

Zeph blinked. "I don't think so? I can check the logs."

"Do so. Now."

The boy nodded and hurried toward the filing cabinet where Cornelius kept meticulous records of every patron request, cross-referenced by name, date, and subject matter.

Dr. Floros watched him go, then looked back at Cornelius. "You think Brother Demos took my journal?"

"I think," Cornelius said carefully, "that a monk who expresses sudden interest in a visiting botanist, mere days before a once-in-fifty-years bloom, bears investigation."

He did not mention the missing volume from his own collection. Not yet. If Brother Demos had stolen *Secret Wonders* six weeks ago, he might have been planning this theft for some time. Researching. Learning the patterns of the library, the guest house, the town.

But why? What did a temple scholar want with medicinal herbs and rare orchids?

The answer rose immediately: Money. Rare plants could be sold to collectors, apothecaries, perfumers. A single Moon-Scented Orchid, documented and harvested at peak bloom, could fetch a small fortune.

Cornelius felt his talons flex against the polished wood of the desk. Book thieves were bad enough. But book thieves who stole for *profit* rather than love of knowledge—

"Boss." Zeph had returned, holding the log book. "Brother Demos requested access to the Herbaria Medica section three times in the past two months. Last request was..." He squinted at the page. "Four weeks ago."

Four weeks. Two weeks before Cornelius's Spring Inventory, when *Secret Wonders* was confirmed present.

And two weeks after, the book was gone.

The pattern sharpened into focus.

"What did he request specifically?" Cornelius asked.

"Uh, looks like he wanted anything on rare coastal plants. Medicinal properties. Cultivation cycles." Zeph looked up. "He seemed really interested in the bloom schedules."

Dr. Floros made a small, distressed sound. "He was researching. Learning enough to know the journal's value."

"So it would appear." Cornelius stood, stretching his wings briefly before folding them tight again. His mind was already racing ahead, cataloging next steps.

He needed to locate Brother Demos. Question him. Search his quarters if necessary. If the monk had both *Secret Wonders* and Dr. Floros's journal, they would be hidden somewhere he felt secure. The temple archives, perhaps. Or a private room.

But first, he needed to confirm the monk was actually in town. The Festival drew travelers from across the region, but the temple scholars typically avoided the chaos. They preferred their quiet archives and—

A flicker of movement outside the window caught his eye.

Cornelius went still, every predatory instinct suddenly alert.

There. In the alley behind the library. A figure in gray robes, moving fast, head down. The hem of the robe flapped as the figure ran, revealing muddy boots.

And in the figure's arms, clutched tight against his chest: a brown leather book.

Twenty centimeters tall. Distinctive pressed-flower design just visible on the cover, catching the light.

Brother Demos.

Running.

With a book.

The fury that rose in Cornelius's chest was cold and sharp and absolutely certain. That was *his* thief. The thief who had violated the sanctity of his library, stolen from his collection, and then had the audacity to steal from a visiting scholar.

"There," he hissed, launching himself from the desk.

He hit the window ledge at full speed, talons scrabbling for purchase on the stone sill. His wings flared for balance. Below, Brother Demos glanced up at the sound, face pale and startled in the late afternoon light.

Their eyes met for a single, frozen instant.

Then the monk turned and ran.

Cornelius's vision narrowed to a predatory focus. The synthetic musk scent, the timeline inconsistencies, the question of why a temple scholar would need rare botanical texts—all of it faded into background noise.

The facts were simple:

Missing library book. Brown leather. Botanical content.

Missing field journal. Brown leather. Botanical content.

Monk with known interest in medicinal plants, fleeing the scene, clutching a brown leather book.

It was not subtle. It was not clever.

It was *obvious*.

And Cornelius had spent a century cataloging, organizing, and solving puzzles. He knew how to recognize a pattern when it ran directly past his window.

"Zephyr," he said, very calmly. "Fetch my investigation satchel from the office. The brown leather one. Second shelf, left side."

"Uh, Boss? What are you—"

"*Now*, Zephyr."

The boy scrambled to obey.

Cornelius turned to Dr. Floros, who had risen from her chair and was staring out the window with wide eyes. "Your thief," he said, "is Brother Demos. I have just seen him. He is currently fleeing east through the service alleys with what I believe to be your journal."

She pressed a hand to her mouth. "You're certain?"

"I am certain he is running, in broad daylight, with a leather book clutched to his chest like a guilty child stealing sweets." Cornelius felt his tail lash once, a sharp flick of satisfaction. "Innocent men do not run. Particularly not when they have been observed."

"Then we have to go after him!" Dr. Floros started toward the door. "If he reaches the temple—"

"Dr. Floros." Cornelius fixed her with a steady look. "I appreciate your urgency. But chasing him through the Festival crowds in your current state will accomplish nothing except exhausting yourself and alerting him that he is being pursued. Better to approach this intelligently."

She stopped, visibly forcing herself to calm. "What do you propose?"

"I propose," Cornelius said, as Zeph returned with the satchel, "that we visit the temple. Quietly. We will speak to the head priest, review Brother Demos's quarters, and recover your journal through official channels. If he has fled there seeking sanctuary, we will have him cornered. If he has fled elsewhere, the temple records will tell us where he might go."

It was logical. Methodical. Properly procedural.

It was also deeply, personally satisfying.

No one stole books in his town. Not from his library. Not from visiting scholars under his protection.

And certainly not from Imelda's friends.

Cornelius felt the familiar, comfortable weight of a case settling over him like a well-worn cloak. The wrongness of the missing volume, the anxiety of the disrupted inventory—all of it crystallized into purpose.

He would find Brother Demos.

He would recover the stolen books.

And he would restore order.

"Zephyr," he said. "Lock the library. We are going out."

The boy's eyes went wide. "But—my date—Sophia's expecting me at—"

"This will take one hour. Perhaps less, if Brother Demos proves cooperative." Cornelius spread his wings and glided to the floor, landing beside his satchel. "You may still make your Festival appointment. But first, we have a thief to apprehend."

Zeph looked torn. Then he sighed and reached for his coat. "Fine. But if I miss the beetle lighting, you're explaining it to Sophia."

"Noted." Cornelius nosed open the satchel and did a quick inventory: notebook, three pencils, a measuring tape, a magnifying lens, and a small vial of ink for taking notes in the field. Everything in order. Everything in its place.

He looked up at Dr. Floros. "I will recover your journal, Doctor. You have my word."

She stared at him for a long moment. Then, slowly, she nodded. 

"Thank you," she whispered.

Cornelius inclined his head in acknowledgment, already calculating routes and approach strategies.

The Hunt had begun.
