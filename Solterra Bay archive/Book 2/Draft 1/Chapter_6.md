# Chapter 6

"You look terrible," Cornelius said.

Zeph made a sound that was half groan, half whimper. He had shown up at the library precisely on time—a minor miracle—but appeared to have slept in his Festival clothes. The cream linen shirt bore suspicious wrinkles. His hair stuck up at angles that defied both gravity and sanity. Dark smudges shadowed his eyes.

"Thank you, Boss. That's very encouraging."

"I am merely observing fact." Cornelius adjusted his spectacles and studied his assistant with clinical detachment. "Did you locate Sophia after the... incident?"

"No." Zeph's hands moved through his hair, making the situation worse. "She waited at the fountain for half an hour. Then she left. Her friend Callista told me. In great detail. About how disappointed Sophia was. And how I'm 'unreliable.' Which is rich, coming from someone who—" He stopped, shook his head. "Never mind. Where are we going?"

"The Festival Pavilion."

Zeph stopped walking. "The what?"

"The temporary structure erected in Harbor Square for visiting merchants and artists during Festival season." Cornelius continued down the library steps without breaking stride. "I require access to Kyriakos Vlahos. According to Nephele, he is staying at the Seacliff Villa, but my inquiries this morning revealed he has established a commercial presence at the Pavilion. We will find him there."

"We're investigating Kyriakos?" Zeph hurried to catch up. "I thought you said he was irrelevant. A coincidence."

Cornelius's tail twitched. He had spent most of the night reassessing his notes. The word *WRONG* still sat at the top of his desk blotter, accusatory in its simplicity.

Captain Theo had demanded evidence. Facts, not patterns.

Very well. Cornelius would provide facts. He would interview every possible suspect with methodical thoroughness. He would eliminate variables until only the truth remained.

He would *not* make assumptions.

Even if it meant wasting time on a pompous celebrity perfumer who almost certainly had nothing to do with the theft.

"I am clearing the board," Cornelius said. "Brother Demos remains the most logical suspect, but I failed to verify certain details before taking action. I will not repeat that mistake. Therefore, I am conducting formal interviews with all individuals who had proximity to the crime scene or motive to acquire rare botanical knowledge."

"So... everyone?"

"Everyone relevant."

Zeph rubbed his face. "This is because Theo yelled at you, isn't it?"

"Captain Theo did not yell. He delivered a professional reprimand regarding procedural overreach." The words tasted like ash. "Which was, technically, warranted."

"You're actually admitting you were wrong?"

"I am admitting I was *incomplete*." Cornelius kept his gaze fixed forward. "There is a difference."

They walked in silence for a block. The morning streets were already crowded with Festival activity. Vendors arranged displays of honey cakes and candied nuts. Musicians tuned instruments in doorways. Someone had strung paper beetles from the awnings, their wings catching the breeze.

Cornelius ignored all of it. His mind was occupied with the problem at hand.

Kyriakos Vlahos. Celebrity perfumer. Present at the Seacliff Villa during the relevant timeframe. Connected to the synthetic musk scent detected at the crime scene.

But also: wealthy, famous, and completely visible. Would such a person risk personal involvement in petty theft?

Unlikely.

Still. Facts, not patterns. He would verify the man's alibi and eliminate him properly.

The Festival Pavilion came into view as they rounded the corner into Harbor Square.

Cornelius stopped.

"Oh," Zeph said. "That's... new."

The Pavilion dominated the square. It was a temporary structure—ostensibly—but clearly built by people with more money than aesthetic sense. Wooden posts supported a peaked canvas roof dyed in garish stripes of purple and gold. Lanterns hung from every beam, unlit now but clearly intended for dramatic evening effect. The entire thing sprawled across what had been open plaza, transforming public space into a maze of vendor stalls and display tables.

Noise poured from the interior. Voices haggling, laughing, calling out prices. The clatter of wooden crates being moved. Music from somewhere deep inside—a flute attempting to compete with the general chaos and losing badly.

Cornelius's scales prickled with distaste.

"Come on," he said.

They entered the Pavilion.

The interior was worse. Stalls crammed together in uneven rows, their wares spilling onto shared tables. Silks here, ceramics there, jewelry displayed on velvet cloths beside baskets of dried figs. The air smelled of roasted nuts and woodsmoke and something sharp that made Cornelius's nostrils flare.

Oil. Perfume oil.

He followed the scent deeper into the Pavilion, weaving between customers and stepping over crates. Zeph trailed behind, looking increasingly miserable.

"Boss, if this takes too long, I need to—I promised I'd try to find Sophia at the tile workshop later, and if I'm late again—"

"Then do not be late." Cornelius spotted a stall ahead draped in cream-colored silk. Glass bottles gleamed on tiered shelves. "We are here."

The stall was larger than the others, positioned in a prime corner location with space for customers to browse comfortably. The display was artful: bottles arranged by color, from pale amber to deep violet. Small brass plaques identified each scent. Labels written in elegant script.

And standing behind the central table, speaking to a well-dressed customer, was Kyriakos Vlahos.

He was exactly what Cornelius had expected. Satyr-kin, with the characteristic elegance of that bloodline. Tall and lean, with dark hair swept back from a high forehead. His clothes were expensive—tailored silk the color of slate, with subtle embroidery at the cuffs. Small horns curved back from his temples, polished to a gleam.

Handsome, if one liked that sort of thing.

Cornelius did not.

The perfumer finished his conversation with the customer—a transaction involving a small crystal bottle and an obscene amount of coin—and looked up as Cornelius approached.

His expression shifted. Surprise, then recognition, then something that looked like amusement.

"Well," Kyriakos said. His voice was smooth. Cultured. The kind of voice that had never needed to shout to be heard. "A Library Dragon. In my humble stall. To what do I owe this unexpected honor?"

Cornelius sat back on his haunches and fixed the perfumer with a level stare. "I am Cornelius Drake, Head Librarian of Solterra Bay. I have questions regarding your presence in the harbor district two evenings ago."

"Questions." Kyriakos's smile did not quite reach his eyes. "How delightfully official." He gestured to the stall around them. "As you can see, I am engaged in commerce at the moment. Perhaps you could return during a less busy time?"

"This will not take long."

"I am quite certain it will not." The perfumer leaned against his display table, casual and unthreatened. "Very well. Ask your questions, Master Drake. I have nothing to hide."

Cornelius's ear-frills pricked forward. "You placed an order with Nephele of Nephele's Catch for fresh oysters, to be delivered to the Seacliff Villa on the evening of the Festival Eve. Correct?"

"I did. The oysters were excellent."

"What time did you receive the delivery?"

"Around seven bells, I believe. Perhaps slightly after. I did not check my timepiece."

"And your location prior to that delivery?"

Kyriakos raised one elegant eyebrow. "Am I a suspect in something, Master Drake?"

"I am conducting an investigation into a theft. I require alibis from all individuals with proximity to the crime scene."

"How thrilling. Very well." The perfumer straightened and brushed an invisible speck from his sleeve. "I spent the afternoon at the Harbor Master's office, arranging import permits for my materials. Thrilling bureaucracy, as I'm sure you can imagine. Then I returned to the Villa around six bells, bathed, changed, and received a delivery of oysters from a rather efficient fisherwoman. After that, I had dinner. Alone. With an excellent wine. I retired early, as I had business to attend to the following morning."

"What sort of business?"

"The acquisition of rare materials for my craft." Kyriakos gestured to the bottles behind him. "I am a perfumer, Master Drake. My work requires access to unusual substances. Festival season provides opportunities to meet with specialized traders who do not typically visit Solterra Bay."

"What sort of substances?"

The perfumer's smile sharpened. "Are you interested in the art of perfumery? How unexpected."

"I am interested in facts."

"Facts. Of course." Kyriakos moved along his display, trailing one finger across the glass bottles. "Yesterday morning, I met with a trader from the southern isles who specializes in ambergris. A rare material, essential for certain high-end formulations. The transaction took place at the docks, around eight bells. Quite early, but he was departing on the morning tide."

Eight bells. Dr. Floros had returned to her room and discovered the theft around the same time.

Which meant Kyriakos had been at the docks. The opposite end of town from the Sea View Guest House.

An alibi. Easily verified.

Cornelius made a mental note to confirm the details with the Harbor Master later. But the timeline fit. Nephele had delivered oysters at seven bells. Kyriakos claimed to have been at the Villa that evening. And the following morning, he had been conducting business elsewhere.

It was thin. But it held together.

"Did you leave the Seacliff Villa at any point during the night?" Cornelius asked.

"No. Why would I?"

"The Sea View Guest House is accessible from the Villa via the service alley behind the harbor buildings."

Kyriakos laughed. It was a light, musical sound. Utterly genuine. "Are you suggesting I climbed through alleyways to burglarize a guest house? Master Drake, I am a perfumer, not a thief. If I required something from a scholar staying at a modest establishment, I would simply purchase it. Legally. Like a civilized person."

The disdain in his voice was palpable.

Cornelius's claws scraped against the wooden floorboards. "What do you know about Dr. Anthea Floros?"

"Who?"

"A botanist. Currently staying at the Sea View Guest House."

"I have never heard of her."

"She is a leading expert on rare coastal plants."

"How nice for her." Kyriakos returned to his position behind the table. "I am afraid botany is not my area of expertise. I purchase my materials from specialized suppliers. I do not harvest them myself."

"But you have an interest in rare plants. For your perfumes."

"I have an interest in the *essences* derived from plants. There is a difference. I do not need to understand photosynthesis to appreciate the scent of jasmine." He picked up one of the bottles and held it to the light. The liquid inside gleamed pale gold. "My craft is art, Master Drake. Not science."

There was something about the way he said it. A casual dismissal of scholarship. Of knowledge for its own sake.

It rankled.

Cornelius's tail lashed once. "Have you visited the Solterra Bay Library during your stay in town?"

"No. I have no need of libraries."

"No interest in botanical texts? Field guides? Historical records of plant cultivation?"

"None whatsoever. I leave such things to scholars." Kyriakos set the bottle down with deliberate care. "I create beauty, Master Drake. I do not catalog it."

The scent hit Cornelius then. Properly, fully, now that he was paying attention.

It rolled off Kyriakos in waves. Synthetic musk. Heavy and sweet, with undertones of amber and something darker. Expensive. Overwhelming.

The exact scent from Dr. Floros's room.

Cornelius went very still.

The perfume. Kyriakos No. 5. The signature fragrance.

Of course Kyriakos Vlahos smelled like his own creation. He was wearing it. Advertising it. The man was a walking advertisement for his brand.

The scent at the crime scene meant nothing. It only confirmed that Kyriakos's perfume was popular. Prevalent. Exactly as Cornelius had theorized before.

Someone at the guest house wore it. Or had encountered someone who wore it. Or purchased a bottle from a merchant. Or passed Kyriakos himself in the street during Festival.

The scent was ubiquitous. It proved nothing.

Cornelius forced his scales to settle. "One final question. Did you approach Dr. Floros at any point during the Festival? In the market, perhaps? Or near the harbor?"

"I have already told you I do not know who she is."

"You are quite certain."

"Master Drake." Kyriakos's patience appeared to be wearing thin. "I have answered your questions with remarkable tolerance, given that you have provided no legal justification for this interrogation. I have an alibi for the time in question. I have no knowledge of your missing botanist or her work. I have no connection to your library. Is there anything else, or may I return to my actual business?"

Cornelius studied him. The polished horns. The expensive clothes. The casual arrogance of someone who had never needed to justify his existence to anyone.

This was not a thief.

This was a wealthy fool who sold overpriced perfume to people with more money than sense.

The pattern did not fit. The motive was absent. The alibi held.

"That will be all," Cornelius said.

"How relieved I am." Kyriakos turned away, already dismissing him.

But then he paused. Looked back. Smiled.

"Although, while you are here, Master Drake, I do have a proposition for you."

Cornelius's ear-frills flattened. "I am not interested in purchasing perfume."

"Not perfume. Books." Kyriakos leaned against the table again, his expression shifting to something that looked almost... calculating. "I have heard certain things about the Solterra Bay Library. Rare texts. Unusual collections. Items not found in larger institutions."

"The library's collection is not for sale."

"Everything is for sale, Master Drake. It is simply a matter of price." He gestured to his stall. "I am a collector, you see. Not just of scents, but of beauty in all its forms. First editions. Illuminated manuscripts. Works of botanical art. I would be willing to pay quite generously for access to certain... specialized volumes."

Cornelius's claws dug into the floorboards. "The library is a public institution. Its collection serves scholarly research and community education. It is not a private hoard for wealthy dilettantes."

"Such passion. How quaint." Kyriakos's smile sharpened. "But consider, Master Drake. Libraries require funding, do they not? Maintenance. Acquisitions. Salaries for staff." His gaze flickered to Zeph, who had been standing silent and increasingly uncomfortable throughout the conversation. "I could ensure your institution prospers. All I ask in return is... cooperation."

"The answer is no."

"You have not even heard my offer."

"I do not need to hear it. The library's collection is not for sale. Not to you. Not to anyone." Cornelius turned away, tail lashing. "Come, Zeph. We are leaving."

Behind him, Kyriakos laughed. "A pity. I do so appreciate beautiful things. Even when they smell of old paper and dust."

The words were designed to sting.

They succeeded.

Cornelius did not respond. He walked out of the stall, through the chaos of the Pavilion, and back into the relative sanity of Harbor Square. Zeph followed, silent until they were well clear of the structure.

"Boss," he said carefully. "That scent. The one Kyriakos was wearing. That was—"

"His signature perfume. Yes. I am aware."

"But at the guest house, you said—"

"I said the scent was present at the crime scene. Which it was. Because Kyriakos No. 5 is currently one of the most popular fragrances in Solterra Bay. Its presence proves nothing except that someone in the vicinity wore expensive perfume."

Zeph was quiet for a moment. "He was wearing a lot of it."

"He is a perfumer. Of course he was."

"Right. Yeah. That makes sense."

They walked back toward the library. Cornelius's mind was already moving to the next item on his list. Kyriakos Vlahos: eliminated. Alibi confirmed. Motive absent. Connection to the theft: nonexistent.

Which left Brother Demos.

Again.

The pattern kept returning to the same conclusion. The temple scholar with proven interest in rare plants. The hooded figure in the alley. The brown leather book.

Captain Theo had demanded evidence. Very well. Cornelius would find evidence. He would investigate properly this time. Methodically. Without assumptions.

But the fundamental logic remained unchanged.

Brother Demos was the thief.

Cornelius was certain of it.

Behind him, unnoticed, Zeph glanced back toward the Festival Pavilion. His expression was troubled. But when Cornelius asked if something was wrong, the boy simply shook his head and said he was tired.

They returned to the library in silence.

Cornelius went directly to his desk. He pulled out his investigation notes—the ones marked *WRONG* in large letters—and added a new entry.

*Kyriakos Vlahos: Eliminated. Alibi confirmed (ambergris transaction, 8 bells, docks). No motive. No connection to victim or stolen materials. Scent presence explained by commercial popularity of product. Suspect cleared.*

He underlined the final word twice.

Crossed Kyriakos's name off the list.

And returned his attention to the only suspect who mattered.

The Hunt, despite Captain Theo's skepticism and Cornelius's recent humiliation, was not over.

It was simply more complicated than he had initially believed.

But complexity could be unraveled. Patterns could be verified. Evidence could be found.

Cornelius Drake was a librarian. He specialized in organization, categorization, and the systematic arrangement of information.

He would solve this case.

Properly this time.

He picked up his pencil and began drafting questions for his next interview. Brother Demos might be protected by temple law, but there were other ways to gather information. Other sources. Other patterns to explore.

The journal was still missing. Dr. Floros's once-in-a-lifetime research opportunity was still at risk. And somewhere in this town, a thief still walked free.

Cornelius would find them.

Even if it meant interviewing every scholar, merchant, and Festival visitor in Solterra Bay.

Order would be restored.

He was certain of it.
