**pov_details:** Cornelius Drake, Third Person Limited, Past Tense

**setting_and_timeline:** Solterra Bay Rooftops & Cliff Base. Night (11:30 PM).

**emotional_shift:** From **Panic** (The Crowd) to **Focus** (The Climb).

**authorial_intent_and_subtext:** This is the physical peak. Show the contrast between the "Soft" librarian life and the "Hard" reality of the chase. Zeph steps up.

**key_information_and_world_building_revealed:**
*   **Character:** Zeph is surprisingly agile (Botanist climbing skills). Cornelius is a reluctant flyer.
*   **Plot/Mystery:** They spot Kyriakos ahead. He is winning.
*   **World-Building:** The architecture of the town (verticality).

**subplot_advancement:** Zeph trusts Cornelius to catch him. "The Leap".

**end_of_chapter_hook:** They see Sophia and Orestes below. The team is converging on the summit.

**chapter_summary_for_writer:** Cornelius and Zeph escape the gridlocked festival crowd by taking to the rooftops. The chase is frantic and physical, forcing Cornelius to embrace his draconic naturte and Zeph to utilize his tree-climbing skills. They navigate narrow drains and steep tiles, culminating in a terrifying leap across a ten-foot gap. From the high tower, they spot Kyriakos's lantern nearing the summit of Widow's Perch. They are behind, but free of the crowd. Seeing Sophia and Orestes starting the climb from the trail below, Cornelius roars a signal. The race becomes a vertical sprint to the top.

### chapter_17

**tentpole_tag:** The Epiphany (The Plan)

**characters_in_this_chapter:** Cornelius Drake, Zeph, Sophia, Orestes

**pov_details:** Cornelius Drake, Third Person Limited, Past Tense

**setting_and_timeline:** The Cliff Switchback (Just below summit). Night (11:45 PM).

**emotional_shift:** From **Desperation** (He will destroy the evidence) to **Ingenuity** (The Weld).

**authorial_intent_and_subtext:** The solution MUST be intellectual/scientific, not just violence. Solving it with "Fire" is too simple; solving it with "Fire + Metallurgy" is Cornelius.

**key_information_and_world_building_revealed:**
*   **Plot/Mystery:** The Plan: Zeph distracts Kyriakos with vanity. Cornelius welds the lead gasket shut to seal the gas.
*   **World-Building:** Melting point of Lead vs. Dragon Breath temp.

**subplot_advancement:** Zeph volunteers to be the "Face". He finds his courage.

**end_of_chapter_hook:** The team moves into position. Midnight is minutes away.

**chapter_summary_for_writer:** The team reunites on the final switchback, exhausted and racing against the clock. Orestes warns that Kyriakos will destroy the evidence if cornered. Sophia explains that the Stasis Jar is reinforced and unbreakble. This sparks an epiphany in Cornelius: he asks about the seal's material (lead) and realizes his dragon fire can melt it, fusing the lid shut and trapping the incriminating gas inside forever. Zeph volunteers to create the necessary opening by distracting Kyriakos with "fanboy" praise for his design. They move into position for the final strike.

### chapter_18

**setting_and_timeline:** The Widow's Perch (Summit). Midnight.

**emotional_shift:** From **Tension** (The approach) to **Triumph** (The Weld).

**authorial_intent_and_subtext:** The defeat of the villain comes from his own ego (answering Zeph) and his own tool (The Jar). It is poetic justice.

**end_of_chapter_hook:** Kyriakos is trapped with the jar. Captain Theo is coming. The flower is safe.

**chapter_summary_for_writer:** At the summit, Kyriakos prepares to harvest the orchid's scent. Zeph interrupts him, feigning admiration for the "Vlahos-1" jar design. Kyriakos's vanity buys Cornelius the split second he needs. Approaching from behind, Cornelius uses a precision burst of fire to melt the jar's lead gasket, welding it shut instantly. Kyriakos drops the jar in pain, and it seals, trapping the illegal gas inside. Sophia and Orestes emerge to surround him. Kyriakos threatens to cut the plant, but Cornelius points out he is already holding sealed evidence of his crime. Defeated by physics and his own design, Kyriakos surrenders as the orchid blooms safely.

**authorial_intent_and_subtext:** Wrap up the "Legal" plot. Validate the "Cozy Justice" (Arrest, not death). Validate the Romance.

**key_information_and_world_building_revealed:**
*   **Character:** Theo respects the "Hard Evidence".
*   **Plot/Mystery:** The Journal is recovered (found near the rocks).
*   **World-Building:** Sophia plans to stay in Solterra Bay.

**subplot_advancement:** Zeph and Sophia confirm a second date.

**end_of_chapter_hook:** The return to the Library. The return to "Normal".

**chapter_summary_for_writer:** Captain Theo arrives and is amused by the "sealed evidence," arresting Kyriakos and seizing his tools. Zeph recovers the stolen Botanist's Journal from the rocks and insists Cornelius be the one to return it. As Sophia packs up, she hints at staying in Solterra Bay to open a glass workshop, much to Zeph's delight. The group descends the trail as the sun rises over a quieted festival. Orestes watches them go from the peak, acknowledging Cornelius with a silent salute. Order is restored.

In his office, Cornelius places the fused glass jar on his shelf—a new addition to his hoard and a memento of the adventure. Zeph invites him to lunch with Sophia, and Cornelius grumpily accepts, marking his acceptance of his "family." He closes the ledger. Case Closed.
