### core_concept

**story_hook:** A curmudgeonly library dragon must recover a stolen field journal to save a rare orchid from a celebrity perfumer who views extinction as the ultimate exclusivity.

**central_conflict:** **Preservation vs. Possession.** External: Cornelius protecting the Orchid from Kyriakos's greed. Internal: Cornelius protecting his orderly life from the chaos of the Festival (and Zeph's investigation).

**high_concept_pitch:** Sherlock Holmes is a dragon who hates noise, investigating a theft during the town's loudest festival, armed only with a nose for clues and a lovesick intern.

**expanded_premise:** When Dr. Anthea Floros loses her journal during Solterra Bay's "Twinkle Nights," Cornelius Drake takes the case to protect his library from chaos. He initially suspects a clumsy monk, Brother Demos, but the clues (synthetic musk, glass shards) lead to Kyriakos Vlahos, a celebrity perfumer. Kyriakos intends to "harvest" the legendary Moon-Scented Orchid, destroying it to create a perfume only he possesses. Cornelius must overcome his own biases and rely on his intern, Zeph, to weld the case shut before the orchid—and the town's peace—is lost for good.

### unique_selling_points

**usp_1:** **The Draconic Sleuth.** The protagonist is a dragon whose "hoard" is knowledge/books. He uses non-human senses (smell/heat/vibration) to solve crimes in a uniquely physical way.

**usp_2:** **Cozy Physics / Restorative Justice.** A mystery where the stakes are high (extinction) but the tone is restorative. The solution comes from community skills (botany, ceramics), and the ending restores the status quo rather than shattering it.

### themes

**primary_theme:** **Preservation vs. Possession.** Is beauty meant to be hoarded (Kyriakos's perfume) or protected in the wild (The Orchid)?

**secondary_theme_1:** **Community as Defense.** The town's "Fishbowl" gossip network acts as an immune system against the villain's secrecy.

**secondary_theme_2:** **The Value of Imperfection.** Cornelius learns to accept Zeph's "messy" human nature (and the chaos of the festival) as a necessary part of life.
