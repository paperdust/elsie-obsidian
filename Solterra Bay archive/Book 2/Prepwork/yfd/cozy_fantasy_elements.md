**cozy_atmosphere:** Solterra Bay is designed for comfort. The primary conflicts are social (gossip) or professional (rivalries), not existential.
*   **The Vibe:** Sun-drenched stone, cool marble, and the smell of baking bread. Even the "Crime Scene" is a luxury guest house.
*   **Comfort Rituals:** Tea (Mint for Cornelius), slow-roasted chickpeas, communally shared meals, and the "Afternoon Nap" (Siesta) which is sacred.

**fantasy_integration:** Magic is utilitarian and domestic, woven into the background.
*   **Domestic Magic:** Cooling boxes keep fish fresh; pest wards keep ants out of sugar; mending spells fix broken teacups.
*   **Species Integration:** Mythological kin (Satyrs, Orcs, Sirens) hold regular jobs. A Satyr isn't a forest spirit; he's the baker who complains about flour prices.
*   **The Protagonist:** Cornelius is a Dragon, but "Dragon-ness" implies hoarding books and being grumpy, not burning villages.

**mystery_mechanics:** The mystery follows strict "Fair Play" rules adapted for fantasy.
*   **Species Traits as Clues:** A clue might be "The thief jumped 10 feet vertically" (pointing to a Satyr) or "The thief held their breath for 10 minutes" (Siren).
*   **Magic Limitation:** Magic cannot solve the crime instantly (no "Truth Spells" allowed in court). Magic leaves traces (Residue) that can be analyzed forensically.
*   **Cornelius's Edge:** His non-human senses (smell/heat detection) allow him to find clues humans miss, essentially acting as a "CSI Lab" on legs.

**low_stakes_physics:** The world is safe for the reader.
*   **Non-Lethal:** Murder is rare; theft/vandalism is preferred. If death occurs, it is bloodless (poison/magic).
*   **Restorative Justice:** The goal is to restore order, not punish. Brother Demos cleans floors as penance; Kyriakos is arrested, not killed.
*   **Community Core:** The town rallies to protect its own. Gossip is a defense mechanism.

**sensory_details:** The narrative prioritizes pleasant sensory experiences even during tension.
*   **Visuals:** Bioluminescent beetles, colored glass, sparkling ocean.
*   **Taste/Smell:** Lemon, oregano, brine, beeswax. (Note: Smell emphasis dialed back per instruction).
*   **Sound:** The distant roar of the ocean vs. the quiet of the library.

**romantic_elements:** (Subplot Only)
*   **Type:** Sweet/Awkward (Zeph & Sophia).
*   **Role:** Adds warmth and stakes (Zeph wants to impress her) without overshadowing the mystery.
