*   **Plot/Mystery:** The case is "closed".

### chapter_15

**key_information_and_world_building_revealed:**
*   **Plot/Mystery:** Kyriakos plans to take the BULB, not just the scent. The Journal contained the fungal symbiosis data needed to keep it alive in a greenhouse.

**subplot_advancement:** Cornelius grabs Zeph to "Fly/Climb". Zeph is terrified.

**end_of_chapter_hook:** They split up. The race to the summit begins.

**chapter_summary_for_writer:** As they prepare to move, the team uncovers the final piece of the puzzle: Kyriakos stole the journal not for the map, but for Anthea's research on the orchid's specific soil and fungal symbiosis. He intends to dig up the entire bulb and transplant it, ensuring he has the only living specimen. Realizing the crowds block the main path, Cornelius decides on a desperate "Dragon's Route" over the rooftops and up the cliff face. He grabs a terrified Zeph to carry him, while Sophia and Orestes take the ground route to cut off retreat. The race is on.
