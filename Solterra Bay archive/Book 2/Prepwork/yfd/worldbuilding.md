**overview_setting_summary:** Solterra Bay is a vertical, sun-drenched coastal town built into limestone cliffs. It is a cosmopolitan mix of Humans (40%), Mythological Kin (35% - Satyrs/Sirens/Gorgons), and Elder Races (Elves/Orcs) living in "Cozy Equilibrium." The aesthetic is Mediterranean Antiquity (stone, terracotta, aqueducts) mixed with domestic magic.

### key_world_details

**key_world_detail_1:** **Demographics:** Integration is total. Mythological Kin (Satyrs/Sirens/Gorgons) hold regular jobs—Satyrs are bakers, Orcs are merchants.

**key_world_detail_2:** **Magic System:** "Domestic Magic." Strictly functional: cooling boxes for food, pest wards for pantries, and mending charms for repairs. No combat magic (fireballs/lightning).

**key_world_detail_3:** **The Tile Families:** Three rival guilds determine the town's aesthetic and economy: **Kallistos** (Traditional/Heavy), **Doukas** (Artistic/The Innovators), and **Veneti** (Merchant/Export).

**key_world_detail_4:** **Dragon Ecology:** Library Dragons (*Draco bibliotheca*) are cat-sized guardians who bond to specific buildings. They hoard knowledge and organized collections, not gold.

**key_world_detail_5:** **Twinkle Nights (The Event):** A bioluminescent beetle migration. The town enforces a strict "Lights Out" policy for three nights, creating a unique visual landscape of deep shadows and blue-green insect glow.

### key_world_rules

**key_world_rule_1:** **The Cozy Physics:** Violence is non-graphic and rare. Conflicts are resolved through social pressure, specific skills (Botany/Ceramics), or non-lethal confrontation.

**key_world_rule_2:** **The Fishbowl Effect:** Privacy is impossible due to the dense, vertical architecture. Neighbors overhear conversations through open windows; gossip spreads instantly.

**key_world_rule_3:** **Mending over Breaking:** The culture values repair (Kintsugi/Healing) over destruction. Broken objects are fixed with gold or magic; relationships are mended rather than severed.

**key_world_rule_4:** **Technological Level:** Antiquity/Medieval mix. Beeswax candles and olive oil lamps provide light (no electricity/gas). Aqueducts provide running water.

**key_world_rule_5:** **Fair Play Biology:** Mystery solutions often hinge on species traits (e.g., a Siren holding their breath, a Satyr's jumping ability) rather than magic.
