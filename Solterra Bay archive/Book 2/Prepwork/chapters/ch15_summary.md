# Chapter 15: The Twist (Summary)

**POV:** Cornelius Drake
**Setting:** The Festival Pavilion (Behind the Cider Tent)

The team is assembled: Cornelius, Zeph, Sophia, and the battered Orestes. The Festival is deafening around them. They have the pieces of the puzzle, but not the picture.

**The Twist (The Logic):**
"Why the Journal?" Cornelius paces. "Kyriakos already knew the specific Orchid species. He knew the location. Why risk stealing Anthea's notes from the Guest House?"
Zeph pushes his glasses up. "The Soil."
Sophia frowns. "What?"
"Anthea's 'Secret Wonder' wasn't just finding the orchid," Zeph explains, voice shaking. "It was the *Nutrient Mix*. She figured out the exact fungal symbiosis needed to make it bloom in captivity."

**The Realization:**
Sophia connects it to her glass design. "He doesn't want to capture the scent in the wild. That's too risky. He wants to dig it up."
"He's taking the bulb," Orestes hisses. "He will sever the roots to steal the mother-plant."
Cornelius feels a chill. "Digging up a *Rex* during bloom shock... it will kill the colony."
It isn't theft. It is extinction.

**The Clock:**
They look at the cliffs. The path is lit by twinkling beetles, but the crowds are thick.
"He has a head start," Cornelius says. "And he is already up there."
"The Festival is between us and the path," Sophia says. "The streets are gridlocked."

**The Decision:**
"We split up," Cornelius commands. "Sophia, Orestes—take the lower road. Zeph, grab the climbing gear. We are going over the roofs."
"The roofs?" Zeph squeaks.
"We are dragons tonight, boy."

End of Chapter 15.
