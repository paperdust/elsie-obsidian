# Chapter 14: The Gathering (Summary)

**POV:** Cornelius Drake
**Setting:** The Festival Pavilion (Behind the Cider Tent)

It is an odd council of war. A dragon, a hermit, a nervous botanist, and a glass-blower in a silk dress.
Cornelius places the **Glass Shard** on the barrel.
"Explain this," he commands Sophia.

**The Expert Witness:**
Sophia picks it up. Her face hardens.
"Protocol 7," she says. "It's fused Borosilicate with a lead lining. I designed this three years ago."
Zeph blinks. "For vases?"
"For *gas capture*," Sophia corrects. "Kyriakos wanted a container that could hold volatile essences without oxidation. He wanted to capture scents that disappear the moment they touch air."
Orestes growls. "The Orchid's breath."

**The Master Plan:**
Cornelius connects the dots.
"The *Cattleyenus Rex* only blooms once every fifty years. For exactly one hour. It releases a pheromone to attract the Twinkle Beetles."
"If he captures that scent," Zeph says, horrified, "Wait... if he puts a jar over the flower... the beetles can't get to it."
"The flower is not pollinated," Orestes finishes. "The species dies. But Kyriakos gets the only bottle of 'Extinction' in the world."

The motive is pure, crystallized Greed. He doesn't want the flower. He wants the *exclusivity* of its death.

**The Plan:**
"He is going back at midnight," Cornelius says. "We cannot call Theo. He won't believe us, and by the time he climbs the cliff, the bloom will be over."
Sophia cracks her knuckles. "I know how to break that glass. It has a resonant frequency."
Zeph adjusts his glasses. "I know the cliff path better than anyone."
Orestes hefts his staff. "I know the roots."
Cornelius smiles, a terrifying draconic grin. "And I have fire."
"We do not go to arrest him," Cornelius declares. "We go to save the flower."

End of Chapter 14.
