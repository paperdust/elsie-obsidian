# Chapter 1: The Count (Summary)

**POV:** Cornelius Drake
**Setting:** The Solterra Bay Library (Afternoon, Pre-Festival)

The story opens with **Cornelius** attempting to maintain order in his sanctuary while the town outside descends into the chaos of "Twinkle Nights." The library windows are blocked by vibrant blue and green banners, creating a gloom that Cornelius actually appreciates, though he despises the noise of hammering and tourist chatter filtering through the stone walls.

Cornelius is performing a **Routine Inventory** of the *Medicinal Herbology* section (Row 4, Shelf B). He prides himself on the library's perfection. He counts the books: *One, two... eleven, twelve.*

He stops. The index card, written in Imelda's precise hand, lists **thirteen** volumes.

He recounts. Still twelve.

He turns to **Zeph**, who is supposed to be shelving returns. Instead, Zeph is staring at his reflection in a brass polished shield, fretting over his cravat. He has a date with **Sophia Doukas** tonight—a "House Doukas" artist—and he is terrified of looking like a "library dusty."

Cornelius interrupts Zeph's panic to report the discrepancy. "We are missing a volume. *Secret Wonders: Field notes on medicinal herbs*. It was here last week."

Zeph is dismissive. "It probably just fell behind the shelf, Cornelius. Or maybe Imelda took it? Can you tell me if this blue matches my eyes, or is it too 'fishmonger chic'?"

Cornelius bristles. The disrespect for the inventory—and the comparison to fishmongers—is grating. He looks at the gap on the shelf. It *bothers* him. His dragon instincts (Hoarding/Counting) itch. But looking at Zeph's desperate face, and hearing the roar of the festival outside, Cornelius makes a choice. If he reports it now, he has to file a theft report with Captain Theo, which means letting the Watch *into* the library during festival week.

"Fine," Cornelius lies to himself. "Clerical error. I will find it tomorrow."

He marks the ledger: *Status: Misplaced.*

Just as he closes the book, a frantic, desperate knocking hammers against the main library door. It is too loud for a patron. It sounds like trouble.

End of Chapter 1.
