# Chapter 18: The Showdown (Summary)

**POV:** Cornelius Drake
**Setting:** The Widow's Perch (Summit)

The scent of the Orchid is intoxicating. It is heavy, sweet, and primal.
**Kyriakos** is hunched over the flower, the heavy glass Bell Jar capturing every wisp of the purple gas. He is muttering to himself about "gold" and "legacy."

**The Distraction:**
"Mr. Vlahos!"
Zeph stumbles out of the brush, adjusting his tie. He looks terrified but determined.
Kyriakos whirls, hand going to his belt (where a silver gardening trowel hangs like a dagger).
"A tourist?" Kyriakos sneers. "Go away, boy. This is private property."
"Is that... is that the *Vlahos-1*?" Zeph asks, stepping closer. "I read about it in *Glass Monthly*! The vacuum seal technique is legendary!"
Kyriakos pauses. The vanity is weaker than the greed, but only barely. "You... know my work?"
"Know it? It's genius! The way you used lead gaskets instead of rubber!"

**The Strike:**
Kyriakos is looking at Zeph. He is not looking at the rock behind him.
Cornelius pulls himself up over the ledge. He is silent. He takes a deep breath, focusing the fire in his second stomach. He needs a laser, not a bomb.
He exhales.
A thin, blue line of fire strikes the metal collar of the jar.
*Sizzle.*

**The Weld:**
Kyriakos screams and drops the jar. "My hand!" (He is singed, not burned).
The jar hits the mossy ground. It rolls. The lead gasket, now molten, cools instantly against the cold glass.
Cornelius lands on top of the jar, claws out. "The Vlahos-1," Cornelius rumbles. "Remarkable design. Completely tamper-proof. Now including the contents."

**The Checkmate:**
Kyriakos lunges for the jar. "Give it back! That is my property!"
Sophia steps out from the trees. "Actually, the design is mine. You stole the patent."
Orestes steps out from the rocks, wielding his staff. "And the flower is mine."
Kyriakos looks around. He grabs his silver trowel. "I'll cut it! I'll cut the whole plant!"
Cornelius taps the welded jar. "Go ahead. But the evidence of your poaching is already sealed in here. And Captain Theo is climbing the path right now."

Kyriakos sags. He looks at the jar—his prize, now his prison.
The Orchid blooms on, undisturbed.

End of Chapter 18.
