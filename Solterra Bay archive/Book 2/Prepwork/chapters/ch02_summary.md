# Chapter 2: The Intrusion (Summary)

**POV:** Cornelius Drake
**Setting:** The Library (Main Hall)

The knocking resolves into **Dr. Anthea Floros** bursting through the heavy oak doors. She is a flurry of frantic energy—vines in her graying hair wilting with distress, her usually impeccable tweed jacket misbuttoned. She bypasses Zeph entirely and collapses into a chair opposite Imelda's desk.

"It's gone," she gasps. "The Journal. The Moon-Scented Orchid data. All of it."

**Imelda** is instantly at her side, offering tea and steel. **Cornelius**, however, remains behind his desk, observing. He notes the mud on Anthea’s hem (red clay from the cliffs) and the faint scent of *synthetic musk* clinging to her (which he files away, but dismisses as irrelevant compared to the mud).

Anthea explains: She left the Journal on her desk at the **Sea View Guest House** while she went for a morning walk. When she returned, the window was unlatched and the book was gone. She insists it was stolen. Cornelius, knowing Anthea's history of absent-mindedness, is skeptical. "Are you sure, Anthea? You didn't perhaps leave it on a rock while admiring a fern?"

Anthea bristles, indignation masking fear. "I am not senile, Cornelius! It was *taken*!"

Cornelius sighs, preparing to decline. He acts as a Librarian, not a Private Investigator. But as he turns to the window to gesture at the festival crowds ("Too busy, impossible to search"), his gaze catches movement in the alleyway below.

**Brother Demos.**

The young monk is sprinting away from the direction of the Guest House. He is sweating. He looks terrified. And clutched tight against his chest, half-hidden under his robes, is a **thick, dark leather-bound book**.

Cornelius freezes. The book is the exact size and color of the *Secret Wonders* volume missing from his shelves. It is also, presumably, the exact size and color of a standard field journal.

The logic snaps into place with satisfying, dangerous certainty.
*   Fact 1: A book is missing.
*   Fact 2: Anthea claims her book was stolen.
*   Fact 3: Demos is running away with a book, looking guilty.

*Conclusion:* Demos stole the Journal.

Cornelius turns back to Imelda and Anthea, a sharp, predatory smile curling his lips. "Very well, Anthea. I will find your book. In fact... I believe the investigation will be quite short."

End of Chapter 2.
