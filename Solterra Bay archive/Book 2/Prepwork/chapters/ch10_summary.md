# Chapter 10: The Midpoint (Summary)

**POV:** Cornelius Drake
**Setting:** The Library (Reading Room)

Cornelius plays his hand. He summons the players. **Anthea** (anxious), **Imelda** (stern), and **Captain Theo** (brought in "on official business" by a triumphant Cornelius, who promised "Hard Evidence"). **Zeph** and **Brother Demos** are present as witnesses.

**The Speech:**
Cornelius paces. He feels like a titan.
"For days, we have assumed a complex conspiracy. But the truth is simple."
He points at Demos.
"We have a suspect who was seen fleeing the scene. A suspect who has been hiding a dark leather volume in his private quarters."

**The Confrontation:**
Demos is trembling. "Master Drake, please..."
Cornelius produces the *Dark Leather Book* from his satchel.
"Denial is useless, Brother Demos. I retrieved this from your carrel last night."
He slams the book onto the table.
"Dr. Floros. Your lost work."

**The Pivot:**
Anthea reaches out. Her hands shake. She opens the cover.
She frowns.
"Cornelius... this is *Secret Wonders*. It's a field guide to medicinal herbs."
She holds it up. Stamped inside is the library seal: *Property of Solterra Bay.*

**The Truth:**
Demos collapses into a chair, burying his face in his hands. "I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Imelda said it was Reference Only, but I needed the section on mosses for my thesis! I was going to bring it back!"

**The Silence:**
Cornelius stares at the book. It is not the *Journal*.
His beautiful, perfect theory disintegrates.
Wait. If Demos stole *this* book...
Then Demos didn't steal the Journal.
And Orestes hates books.
And Sophia was painting.
And Nephele is clumsy.
And Kyriakos has an alibi.

"So," Captain Theo says, his voice dangerously calm. "To clarify. You broke into a private carrel, harassed a student, and wasted the Watch's time... to recover an overdue library book?"

Cornelius opens his mouth. No sound comes out.
He has not only failed to find the thief. He has proven there *is no suspect left*.

End of Chapter 10.
