# Chapter 19: The Resolution (Summary)

**POV:** Cornelius Drake
**Setting:** The Widow's Perch / The Trail Down

**The Arrest:**
Captain Theo is not amused by the climb, but he is very amused by the **Welded Jar**.
"Sealed evidence," Theo says, tapping the glass. "Very diligent, Cornelius. A bit dramatic with the welding, but diligent."
Kyriakos is handcuffed. He is already shouting about lawyers.
"Take him away," Theo commands. "And grab that spade. Evidence of intent to dig."

**The Journal:**
Zeph retrieves the *Botanist's Journal*. He hands it to Cornelius.
"You should be the one to return it to Anthea," Zeph says.
Cornelius tucks it into his vest. "Indeed. It is past due."

**The Subplot:**
Sophia is packing up her gear. Zeph lingers.
"So," Zeph says. "Borosilicate."
"Ideally," Sophia smiles. "I'm thinking of starting a new workshop. Here. The sand quality is excellent."
"I know a lot about sand," Zeph says eagerly.
Cornelius groans. "Do not discuss sediment density on a first date, boy."
Sophia laughs. "Actually, I'm interested."

**The Departure:**
They walk down the trail. The sun is rising over the ocean. The Festival is quiet now.
Orestes stands on the peak, watching them go. He raises his staff.
Cornelius breathes a small ring of smoke in return. The Orchid is safe.

End of Chapter 19.
