# Chapter 13: Pinch Point 2 (Summary)

**POV:** Cornelius Drake
**Setting:** The Widow's Perch (Edge of the Cliff)

Cornelius fights the updraft, his wings aching. He spots the campfire—it has been kicked out.
He lands hard.
"Orestes?"
There is no answer from the wind.
Then he sees him.
**Orestes** is tied to a crag of limestone with thick, yellow nylon rope. His head lolls forward. The scent of chloroform is overpowering, mixing violently with the sea air. And beneath it... *Sandalwood and Artificial Musk*.

**The Crime Scene:**
Cornelius checks Orestes's pulse. Slow, but steady. He uses a claw to slice the ropes.
As he works, he spots something glittering in the moonlight.
Shards of glass. Not a bottle—too thick. It looks like laboratory glass.
He carefully pockets a fragment.

**The Awakening:**
Orestes coughs, waking up swinging. "Get back! You cannot have it!"
"It is me, you old fool," Cornelius grunts, holding him steady.
Orestes blinks, his eyes wide. "The Gardener... the False Gardener. He was here."
"Kyriakos?"
"He wore the face of a shadow. He smelled of death. He found the hidden path. He stood right before the *Rex*."
Cornelius freezes. "Did he take it?"
Orestes shakes his head. "He laughed. He checked his watch. He said, 'Not ripe. Two hours.' And then he hit me."

**The Implication:**
Cornelius helps Orestes sit up.
Kyriakos found the Legendary Orchid. He had it in his grasp. And he left it.
"Two hours," Cornelius repeats.
"The Bloom," Orestes whispers. "It opens at midnight for the Beetles. He doesn't want the flower, dragon. He wants the *breath* of the flower."

**The Race:**
Cornelius looks at his pocket watch. 10:45 PM.
They have 75 minutes before the Orchid opens.
75 minutes before Kyriakos returns to harvest the scent—a process that will likely kill the fragile specimen forever.

End of Chapter 13.
