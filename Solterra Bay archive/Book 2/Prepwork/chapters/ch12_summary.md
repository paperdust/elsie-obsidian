# Chapter 12: The Chaperone (Summary)

**POV:** Cornelius Drake
**Setting:** The Festival Grounds (Night)

The stars are gone. In their place, Solterra Bay is filled with the green-gold pulse of the Twinkle Beetles.
It is romantic. It is loud. It is Cornelius's personal hell.
He patrols ten paces behind **Zeph** and **Sophia**, looking grim in a crimson bow tie.

**The Date:**
Sophia is actually enjoying herself. She bought Zeph a stick of fried honey-dough. Zeph has stopped quoting botany textbooks and is just listening to her talk about light refraction.
"It's working," Cornelius murmurs. "The boy is learning silence."

**The Anomaly:**
Cornelius perches on a statue of the town founder to get a better view. He checks the **VIP Tent**.
He expects to see **Kyriakos Vlahos** holding court, drinking wine, and bragging about his perfumes.
But the Golden Chair is empty.
Cornelius scans the perimeter.
There. At the edge of the firelight.
A figure in a dark cloak. Not silk. Rough wool.
He turns, and the festival light catches his profile. Kyriakos.
He is carrying a canvas bag. He is moving with purpose, away from the crowds, away from the hotel, toward the dark, jagged silhouette of the **Widow's Perch**.

**The Decision:**
Cornelius looks at Zeph. Zeph is leaning in to kiss Sophia.
Cornelius looks at Kyriakos. The Villain is making a move.
"You are on your own, boy," Cornelius whispers.
He spreads his wings and takes off into the darkness, following the scent of Synthetic Musk and sea salt.
The investigation is not over. It has just turned dangerous.

End of Chapter 12.
