# Chapter 6: Secrets (Summary)

**POV:** Cornelius Drake
**Setting:** The Pavilion (Festival Grounds)

The morning sun does nothing to warm Cornelius's mood. He is officially "persona non grata" with the Watch regarding Brother Demos. **Captain Theo** has stationed a junior officer outside the library, ostensibly for "Festival Crowd Control," but Cornelius knows it is a minder.

"Fine," Cornelius hisses, polishing his reading glasses until they squeak. "If I cannot catch the rat directly, I will close every other hole."

**The Pivot:**
He drags a sullen **Zeph** (who is nursing a 'date-hangover' of anxiety) to the **Festival Pavilion**. Their target: **Kyriakos Vlahos**.
"We are here to prove he *didn't* do it," Cornelius explains. "So we can go back to Theo with a clean board."

**The Encounter:**
Kyriakos is a peacock. He stands amidst a half-constructed glass palace, shouting at workmen. He is wearing a silk suit that costs more than the library's annual budget.
Cornelius approaches. "Master Vlahos. A moment."
Kyriakos looks down his nose. "Ah. The Librarian. Have you come to apologize for the smell of old paper you drag with you?"

**The Interview:**
Cornelius ignores the insult. "Where were you yesterday morning between 8 and 10 AM?"
Kyriakos laughs. "I was sourcing Ambergris from a private seller at the docks. Ask your fishmonger friend." (This aligns with Nephele's oyster story).
"And did you visit the Guest House?"
"I do not stay in 'Guest Houses', dragon. I stay in the Governor's Villa."

**The Clue:**
Kyriakos leans in to flick a speck of dust from Cornelius's shoulder. As he does, the scent hits Cornelius like a physical blow.
*Synthetic Musk. Ambergris. Sandalwood.*
It is the **exact** scent from Anthea's curtains.
Kyriakos *was* there.
But Cornelius—blinded by his Demos Theory—misinterprets it. "He uses too much cologne. The scent must drift for miles. It could have blown in through the window."

**The Offer:**
Kyriakos smiles, oily and sharp. "You seem stressed, Librarian. Perhaps you need a donation? I could buy your little book collection. Turn it into a proper lounge."
Cornelius bristles. The insult to the Hoard is unforgivable.
"The library is not for sale. And neither am I."

Cornelius leaves, more determined than ever. Kyriakos is an arrogant fop, but he has an alibi (Nephele saw him).
*Status:* Suspect B "Eliminated" (Incorrectly).
*Next Target:* Sophia Doukas.

End of Chapter 6.
