# Chapter 7: The Date (Summary)

**POV:** Cornelius Drake
**Setting:** The Festival Market (Night)

Cornelius is perched on the slate roof of the Bakery, disguised as a very stony gargoyle. Below, the Festival is in full swing. Bioluminescent beetles drift like stars.
He is not enjoying the view. He is watching **Zeph** and **Sophia Doukas**.
"Don't drop the tea, Zeph," Cornelius mutters. "And ask her where she was at 9 AM."

**The Date:**
Zeph is trying too hard. He quotes Latin at Sophia.
Sophia laughs. "Zeph, you sound like a textbook. Relax. Tell me what *you* like."
Zeph blushes. "I like... organization?"
Sophia grins. "I like chaos. And glass."

**The Investigation (Remote):**
Cornelius focuses his Draconic Senses.
*   *Smell:* Turpentine, linseed oil, cheap wine. No Musk.
*   *Inventory:* She has a leather satchel. Cornelius uses his telescopic vision to measure the bulge. Too flat for a 500-page journal.
*   *Motive:* Sophia starts complaining about **Kyriakos**. "That hack! He commissioned me to design a 'revolutionary container' and then claimed the patent for himself! He's a thief of ideas."

**The Alibi:**
Zeph asks (clumsily), "So, uh, were you busy this morning? Near the Guest House?"
Sophia shakes her head. "I was at the **Widow's Perch** from dawn until noon. The light hits the limestone perfectly." She opens her sketchbook to show him.
Cornelius zooms in. The sketches capture the sunrise progression perfectly. Unless she can paint at super-speed while stealing journals, she was miles away.

**The Verdict:**
Cornelius sighs. Sophia is innocent of the theft. She is just an angry artist.
"Useless," Cornelius grumbles. "They are all innocent."
Which leaves... **Orestes**. The Hermit.
Cornelius looks toward the dark cliffs of the Widow's Perch. If Sophia was there, maybe she saw Orestes?
No matter. He will go himself.

End of Chapter 7.
