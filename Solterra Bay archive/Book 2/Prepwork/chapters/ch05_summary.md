# Chapter 5: The Lockdown (Summary)

**POV:** Cornelius Drake
**Setting:** The Library (Main Hall)

Cornelius returns to the library, convinced of Demos's guilt. He sees the monk near the shelves. He is done with subtlety. He pulls the **Iron Lockdown Lever**.
"Code Obsidian!"

The doors slam shut. But Cornelius forgot one thing: The lockdown mechanism is connected to the **Town Watch Alarm System** (a relic from when the library held dangerous grimoires).
Bells ring across Solterra Bay.
Zeph screams about his date. Demos looks terrified but—seeing the commotion—quickly shoves the leather book *behind* a row of encyclopedias.

**The Arrival:**
Within minutes, **Captain Theo Melas** is banging on the door. Cornelius has to unlock it.
Theo marches in, furious. "Cornelius! Is there a fire? A demon? Or did you just lock the doors because you're grumpy about the festival?"

**The Accusation:**
Cornelius points a claw at Demos. "That monk has stolen a valuable text! I demand an arrest!"

**The Defense:**
Demos stands up, shaking. "I... I haven't stolen anything! I was just browsing the *Religion* section! Is browsing a crime now?"
Theo looks at Cornelius. "Well? Where is the book?"
Cornelius: "He has it! Search him!"
Theo pats Demos down. Nothing.
Cornelius: "He hid it! Search the shelves!"
Theo: "There are ten thousand books here, Cornelius. I am not searching them all because you have a hunch."

**The Consequence:**
Theo turns on Cornelius. "This is harassment. You're wasting Watch resources during Twinkle Nights. Master Demos, you are free to go."
Demos scurries out, shooting Cornelius a look of pure relief (and smugness).
Theo leans in close to Cornelius. "If I hear you are bothering that boy again without proof, I will fine you for misuse of the alarm. Leave him alone."

**The State:**
The library is empty. Zeph has fled to his date. The thief got away. The Police have blocked the investigation. Cornelius is alone, humiliated, and more determined than ever.

End of Chapter 5.
