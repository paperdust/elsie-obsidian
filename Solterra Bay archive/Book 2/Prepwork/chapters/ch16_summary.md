# Chapter 16: The Rising Challenge (Summary)

**POV:** Cornelius Drake
**Setting:** The Rooftops of Solterra Bay

The crowd is a beast of many legs and loud drums. They are stuck.
"We will lose him," Zeph shouts over a lute player.
Cornelius looks at the drainpipe of the Sweet Shop. "Up."
"I am not a squirrel, Cornelius!"
"You are a botanist! Climbing trees is your job! Go!"

**The Ascent:**
They scramble up the pipe. Cornelius digs his claws into the stucco. Zeph slips, scrabbles, and pulls himself onto the terracotta tiles.
Below them, the festival is a river of light. Above, the dark cliffs loom.

**The Run:**
They run. Cornelius scampers on all fours, his tail acting as a rudder. Zeph stumbles, slides, but keeps moving.
They leap over alleyways. They navigate the steep pitch of the Town Hall.

**The Gap:**
They reach the end of the High Row. A ten-foot gap separates them from the old Guard Tower that connects to the cliff trail.
Cornelius opens his wings. "I will catch you if you fall. Probably."
Zeph stares at the drop.
"The Orchid, Zeph. Think of the Orchid."
Zeph closes his eyes. He runs. He leaps.
For a second, he is airborne, limbs flailing like a panicked stork.
He lands hard on the other side, rolling to absorb the impact. Safe.

**The View:**
Cornelius glides over to join him.
From the tower, they have a clear view of the **Widow's Perch**.
A single lantern light is moving up the switchbacks. **Kyriakos**.
He is moving fast. He is near the top.
"We are still behind," Cornelius hisses. "But we are free of the crowd."

**The Convergence:**
Down below, at the trailhead, they see Sophia and Orestes breaking free of the mob.
"Meet us at the top!" Cornelius roars down at them (though they probably can't hear).
The race is now vertical.

End of Chapter 16.
