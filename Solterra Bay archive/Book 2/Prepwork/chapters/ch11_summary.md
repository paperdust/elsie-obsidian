# Chapter 11: Reaction (Summary)

**POV:** Cornelius Drake
**Setting:** The Library (Office)

Cornelius is not solving crimes. He is counting paperclips. It is the only thing he can control.
The library is silent. Demos is back to studying (smugly). Imelda is aggressively dusting around Cornelius without speaking.

**The Visit:**
**Anthea Floros** knocks. She looks older today.
"Cornelius," she says softly. "I've been thinking. Stickney's Syndrome... it effects the short-term memory first. My mother had tit."
Cornelius stops counting. "Anthea?"
"Maybe there was no thief," she whispers. "Maybe I left it on the cliff. Maybe the wind took it. I... I should not have accused a monk."
She wipes her eyes. "I will file the Lost Property form. I am going back to the Guest House to pack."

**The Defeat:**
It is the worst possible outcome. Not only did he fail, but the *crime itself* is dissolving into tragedy. Cornelius feels small. He is just a lizard in a vest, pretending to be a guardian.

**The Distraction:**
**Zeph** bursts in, breaking the gloom. He is holding two ties.
"Blue or Green? Quickly! The Festival Opening is in an hour! Sophia is going to be there!"
Cornelius sighs. "Green. It matches your... optimism."
Zeph pauses. He sees Cornelius's slump.
" come with me," Zeph says.
"I am not a party dragon, Zeph."
"Not for the party. For me. I'm going to mess it up. I need a wingman. Someone to kick me under the table if I start talking about mollusks again. Please, Cornelius. Get out of here."

Cornelius looks at the paperclips. He looks at Imelda's disapproving back.
"Fine," he grumbles. "I will ensure you do not embarrass the institution."

End of Chapter 11.
