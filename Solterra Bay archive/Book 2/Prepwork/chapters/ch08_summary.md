# Chapter 8: Pinch Point 1 (Summary)

**POV:** Cornelius Drake
**Setting:** The Widow's Perch (Cliffs)

Cornelius hates flying. It is undignified for a librarian. But the **Widow's Perch** is inaccessible by foot at high tide, and he needs answers from **Orestes**.
He lands heavily on the limestone crag, scattering seagulls.
**Orestes "The Thorn"** is waiting. The hermit looks more like a gnarled olive tree than a man. His skin is patchworked with bark (Dryad-touched), and he smells of wet earth and impending storm.

"You smell of dead words, dragon," Orestes rasps, not turning from the sea.

**The Confrontation:**
Cornelius is blunt. "Did you steal the Botanist's Journal?"
Orestes laughs, a sound like cracking branches. "Steal a book? Why would I touch a corpse? You flatten the trees, bleach them, and scrawl your petty laws on their skin. I do not read, dragon. I listen."

Cornelius pauses. The hatred is genuine. Orestes wouldn't steal a journal to read it. He might burn it, but he wouldn't hide it in a study carrel.
"Then tell me what you know about the Orchid," Cornelius demands.

**The Warning:**
Orestes turns. His eyes are entirely green, no whites.
"The *False Gardener* is coming," he whispers. "The air is sick with synthetic musk. He does not want the flower to bloom. He wants to bottle its soul."
Cornelius stiffens. **Kyriakos.**
"But Kyriakos has an alibi," Cornelius argues.
"The wind does not lie," Orestes says. "The cliff is bleeding."

**The Return:**
Cornelius takes off, shaken. The threat is real. The "False Gardener" is making a move.
But who stole the book?
Nephele is too clumsy.
Sophia was painting.
Kyriakos was buying oysters.
Orestes hates books.

It loops back. It always loops back.
**Brother Demos.**
Demos is the only one who *loves* books. The only one who was at the Guest House. The only one hiding something.
Theo's blockade be damned. Cornelius is going to break into that carrel.

End of Chapter 8.
