# Chapter 17: The Epiphany (Summary)

**POV:** Cornelius Drake
**Setting:** The Cliff Path (The Switchback)

Cornelius and Zeph slide down a scree slope to meet Sophia and Orestes on the main trail. They are breathless, dusty, and adrenaline-sharp.
Above them, the green glow of the beetles is intensifying. Midnight is close.

**The Tactical Meeting:**
"He is up there," Orestes grunts. "He will have the jar open. He is waiting for the *Release*."
Sophia holds up the sketch. "The Stasis Jar is reinforced. You can't break it with a rock. And if you try to wrestle it from him, he'll drop it off the cliff. Evidence gone."

**The Epiphany:**
Cornelius looks at the technical drawing. "What is the seal made of?"
"Lead," Sophia says. "Soft lead gasket for a perfect vacuum."
Cornelius smiles. A small puff of smoke escapes his nostrils.
"Lead melts at 327 degrees," Cornelius says. "A dragon's breath, at 'Teakettle' setting, is 400."
Sophia understands immediately. "You want to solder it shut."
"If I fuse the lid to the neck while the gas is inside," Cornelius says, "He cannot dump it. He cannot deny it. He will be holding a sealed confession."

**The Distraction:**
"He will see a dragon coming," Zeph points out. "He'll cap it and run."
"He needs to be distracted," Orestes says. "I will summon the vines..."
"No magic," Cornelius warns. "Theo needs a clean arrest."
Zeph straightens his tie. "I'll do it. I'll ask him for an autograph."
Cornelius blinks. "An autograph?"
"He's a narcissist, right? I'll ask him about the *Stasis Jar*. I'll tell him I'm a fan of his 'Genius Design'. He won't be able to resist correcting me."

**The Ascent:**
They move out. Zeph takes the lead, practicing his "Fanboy" face. Cornelius takes the shadows, nursing the flame in his chest.

End of Chapter 17.
