# Chapter 3: The Complication (Summary)

**POV:** Cornelius Drake
**Setting:** Sea View Guest House (Cliffside)

Cornelius and Zeph arrive at the **Sea View Guest House**, a charming but weathering structure clinging to the cliffs. They are met not by the owner, but by **Nephele** (The Fishmonger), who is covering the front desk. She is arguing loudly with a courier about a "late payment," establishing her financial desperation.

Cornelius demands access to Dr. Floros's room. Nephele eyes him nervously ("The Dragon is here? Is it about the taxes?") but lets them in.

**The Room:** It is a disaster. Anthea Floros lives like a hurricane of botany. Dried leaves, soil samples, and reference books cover every surface. Cornelius tsks at the inefficiency.

**The Investigation:**
1.  **The Desk:** There is a clear rectangular dust outline where a book sat. It matches the dimensions of the leather volume Demos was carrying. *Confirmation 1.*
2.  **The Window:** It is unlatched. Scuff marks on the sill suggest a forced entry or a clumsy exit.
3.  **The Scent:** Cornelius's nose twitches. A thick, cloying odor clings to the curtains near the window. It is *Synthetic Musk* and *Ambergris*—the signature base of cheap (or trying to be expensive) perfume. It makes Cornelius sneeze. "Disgusting," he mutters. "Anthea really must switch laundry detergents." **He dismisses the clue entirely.**

**The Distraction:**
Zeph, supposedly guarding the door, makes a squeaking noise. Cornelius turns to see him staring out the patio doors. Below, on the terrace, a young woman with sharp, intelligent eyes is sketching the horizon.

**Sophia Doukas.**

"She's calculating the light refraction," Zeph whispers, terrified and awed. "Look at her geometry. It's aggressive."

Cornelius rolls his eyes. "She is drawing a cloud, Zeph. Focus."

But Zeph is useless. He effectively hides behind a potted fern to avoid being seen. Cornelius finishes his sweep. He has what he needs: A missing book, a forced window, and a suspect (Demos) seen fleeing the scene. The "Musk" and Nephele's debts are just background noise to his "Perfect Theory."

"Come, Zeph," Cornelius commands, grabbing the boy by the collar. "We have a monk to hunt."

End of Chapter 3.
