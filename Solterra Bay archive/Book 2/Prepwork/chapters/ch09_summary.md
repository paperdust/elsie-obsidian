# Chapter 9: False Confidence (Summary)

**POV:** Cornelius Drake
**Setting:** The Library (Night/Stealth)

Cornelius sends Zeph home ("Go, prepare your little latin speeches for tomorrow"). He bids Imelda goodnight. He waits until the Junior Watchman outside leans against the wall and begins to snore.

The Library is silent. Shadows stretch long in the moonlight.
Cornelius is no longer a librarian. He is a Dragon in his hoard.

**The Infiltration:**
He moves to the ventilation grate behind the circulation desk. It is dusty—terrible maintenance—but large enough. He unscrews it with a claw and slides inside.
He crawls through the ducts, bypassing the locked gates that separate the Main Hall from the **Private Study Carrels**.
He drops down into the secure corridor.

**The Target:**
Carrel 4. **Brother Demos**.
The lock is simple iron. Cornelius picks it with a quill tip. *Click.*
He slides the door open. The cell is cramped, smelling of beeswax and nervous sweat. Piles of parchment cover the desk.
And there, half-hidden under a stack of "The Lives of Coastal Saints," is the object.

**The Book:**
Dark leather. Brass corners. Roughly 500 pages.
It is exactly as Anthea described.
Cornelius reaches out. His hand trembles—not with fear, but with *vindication*. He doesn't open it. He doesn't need to read it. The physical fact of its existence in Demos's private stash is proof enough.
"Got you," Cornelius whispers. "You thought you could outsmart the Keeper."

**The Exit:**
He leaves everything exactly as it was. He relocks the door. He crawls back through the vent.
He sits in his chair as the sun begins to rise, waiting.
He has won. The puzzle is solved. Tomorrow, he will hand the book to Anthea, expose Demos to Theo, and restore order to his world.
He has never been more confident.
He has never been more wrong.

End of Chapter 9.
