# Chapter 20: Full Circle (Summary)

**POV:** Cornelius Drake
**Setting:** The Library (Day)

**The Return:**
The library smells of old paper and fresh chamomile. It is the best smell in the world.
Cornelius walks to the Reference Desk. **Anthea Floros** is packing her bags, looking defeated.
Cornelius clears his throat.
He places the *Botanist's Journal* on the counter.
"Reference Material returned," he says formally. "Late fees waived due to... extenuating circumstances."
Anthea touches the book like it is holy. She looks at him. "You found it."
"We found it," Cornelius corrects, gesturing to Zeph.

**The Penance:**
In the background, **Brother Demos** is scrubbing the marble floor with a toothbrush. Imelda stands over him.
"Missed a spot, Brother," Imelda says cheerfully.
Demos groans. "Yes, Guardian."
He is not expelled. He is just... re-educated.

**The Hoard:**
Cornelius goes to his office. He sits in his high chair.
On the shelf, next to his collection of shiny rocks and a very old coin, he places a new item.
The **fused glass jar**.
It catches the light. A reminder of the cliff, the fire, and the boy who learned to jump.

**The End:**
Zeph knocks on the door frame. "Lunch, Cornelius? Sophia is meeting us at the Fish Shack."
Cornelius pretends to be annoyed. He creates a small puff of smoke.
"Fish," he grunts. "Acceptable."
He closes the ledger.
*Case Closed.*

End of Book 2.
