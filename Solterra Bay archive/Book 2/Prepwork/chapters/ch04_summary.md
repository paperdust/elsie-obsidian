# Chapter 4: The Valley (Summary)

**POV:** Cornelius Drake
**Setting:** The Library (Stacks) & The Docks

**Scene 1: The Wrong Language**
Back in the safety of the Library, Cornelius finds Zeph pacing the botany aisle, clutching a dusty tome. Zeph is muttering Latin. "*Cypripedium calceolus... Phalaenopsis...*"
Cornelius interrupts. "Zeph, if you say 'Phalaenopsis' to Sophia Doukas, she will think you have a throat infection."
Zeph looks stricken. "I need to sound smart! She's a Doukas! They invented *arches*!"
Cornelius tries to help. "She is an artist. Tell her the Orchid's petals are 'Tyrian Purple' or 'Bioluminescent Azure.' Do not quote the Linnaean taxonomy."
Zeph shakes his head. "No, no. Smart is better. Latin is smart."
Cornelius washes his hands of the boy's romantic future.

**Scene 2: The Fishmonger**
Cornelius ventures to the Docks to interrogate **Nephele**. The sensory overload is immense—rotting kelp, shouting sailors, gutted fish. Cornelius holds a handkerchief to his nose.
He finds Nephele gutting a tuna with terrifying speed. She is defensive immediately.
"I didn't steal the book! I can't even read that fancy script!"
Cornelius presses her on why she was at the Guest House. She cracks.
"I was delivering oysters! For **Kyriakos Vlahos**."
This catches Cornelius's attention. "The Perfumer?"
"Yeah. He eats like a king. Paid me double to deliver them to his carriage this morning. I was dropping them off when I saw the open window."
Cornelius observes her. She is strong, but loud. She knocks over a bucket of eels just turning around.
*Verdict:* She lacks the finesse to secure a window, sneak in, and steal a Journal without waking the neighborhood. She is a witness, not a thief.
But the link to Kyriakos is interesting. Why is the Perfumer buying so many oysters? (Aphrodisiacs? Or just gluttony?)

Cornelius returns to the Library, satisfied. Nephele is clear. Demos is still the prime suspect. It is time to squeeze him.

End of Chapter 4.
