## Chapter 13 State

**CHAPTER SUMMARY**
- **The Arrival:** Cornelius lands at the **Widow's Perch**. The wind is howling.
- **The Discovery:** **Orestes** is not standing guard. He is slumped against the rock face, bound with heavy climbing rope. He is unconscious but alive.
- **The Evidence:**
    - **Physical:** Climbing rope (high quality, not Orestes's vines).
    - **Olfactory:** The air reeks of **Chloroform** and **Synthetic Musk**. (Kyriakos's signature).
    - **Object:** A smashed glass vial on the rocks. Thick glass, reinforced.
- **The Awakening:** Cornelius revives Orestes. Orestes gasps: "The False Gardener... he took the map... he looked at the flower... said 'Not yet'..."
- **The Interpretation:** Kyriakos came here. He subdued Orestes. He found the Orchid (*Cattleyenus Rex*). But he didn't take it. Why?
- **The Crisis:** The encryption of the location is broken. The Guardian is down. The Villain has free access.

**DECISIONS MADE**
- **Cornelius decides to prioritize Orestes** over chasing Kyriakos immediately. *Why:* Doctor Duty (Medic).
- **Orestes decides to trust the Dragon.** *Why:* Cornelius saved him.

**STATE CHANGES**
- **EA (External):** +8 -> +9 (Violence). The Villain has used physical force (chloroform/rope). The "Cozy" rules are straining (but no blood).
- **IA (Internal):** +5 -> +8 (Urgent). No more doubts. Kyriakos is the guy.
- **RA (Relationship):** -1 (Stable).

**THRESHOLD STATUS**
- **Pinch Point 2:** CROSSED. The Threat is confirmed active and dangerous.

**KNOWLEDGE UPDATES**
- **Cornelius Knows:** Kyriakos attacked Orestes. Kyriakos knows where the Orchid is.
- **Reader Knows:** Kyriakos is waiting for the *Bloom*.

**NEXT CHAPTER SETUP**
- **Primary Pressure:** Regrouping with Zeph and Sophia to analyze the Glass Shard and plan the defense.
