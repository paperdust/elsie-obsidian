## Chapter 01 State

**CHAPTER SUMMARY**
- The Solterra Bay Library is under siege by "Twinkle Nights" festival preparations (noise, banners blocking windows).
- **Cornelius** is doing his monthly inventory of the *Medicinal Herbology* section.
- **Zeph** is in a panic about his upcoming date with **Sophia Doukas**, asking about clothes/hair instead of working.
- Cornelius discovers a discrepancy: The inventory list says 13 volumes; he counts 12.
- He attempts to report this to Zeph. Zeph is too distracted ("Do I look desperate?").
- Cornelius, annoyed by the noise and Zeph's incompetence, decides to mark it as "Misplaced" rather than "Stolen" to avoid filling out paperwork during the festival chaos.
- The chapter ends with a frantic knocking at the main door (Anthea's arrival).

**DECISIONS MADE**
- **Cornelius decides to delay the investigation** of the missing book (Secret Wonders) to avoid Festival bureaucracy. *Why:* Fits his V_Annoyance (Tourists/Chaos) + V_Sloth (Paperwork).
- **Zeph decides to deprioritize his job** to focus on Sophia. *Why:* V_Anxiety (Sophia) is dominant (+8).

**STATE CHANGES**
- **EA (External):** 0 -> +1 (Rising). The Festival noise is penetrating the library sanctuary.
- **IA (Internal):** 0 -> +1 (Annoyed). Cornelius is irritated by the interruption of his routine.
- **RA (Relationship):** -2 -> -3 (Strain). Zeph is failing his duties; Cornelius is judging him.
- **Entropy:** Low (Stable).

**THRESHOLD STATUS**
- **Threshold 1 (The Lockdown):** Approaching (Ch 5).
- **Inciting Incident (Ch 2):** Imminent (Knock at the door).

**KNOWLEDGE UPDATES**
- **Cornelius Knows:** A book is missing from Herbology. Zeph is useless today.
- **Zeph Knows:** Cornelius is grumpy.
- **Reader Knows:** The "Missing Book" plot thread has been pulled, but the characters dropped it.

**NEXT CHAPTER SETUP**
- **Primary Pressure:** The Knock at the Door. Anthea Floros arrives with the *real* problem.
