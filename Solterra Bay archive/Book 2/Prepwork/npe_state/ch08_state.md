## Chapter 08 State

**CHAPTER SUMMARY**
- **The Journey:** Cornelius flies (laboredly) to the **Widow's Perch**, the highest cliff point.
- **The Hermit:** He finds **Orestes "The Thorn"** living in a lean-to made of driftwood. Orestes is Dryad-touched—skin like bark, eyes like moss.
- **The Pinch Point (Threat):** Orestes is not afraid of the dragon. He knows Cornelius is there. "The wind smells of ink and greed," Orestes rasps.
- **The Interrogation:** Cornelius asks about the Journal.
- **The Defense:** Orestes spits. "Paper? Dead trees flattened to hold dead words? I do not touch such things. I listen to the roots."
- **The Warning:** Orestes warns Cornelius that "The False Gardener" (Kyriakos?) is coming. "The Scent is wrong. The flower screams."
- **Cornelius's Verdict:** Orestes is a fanatic, likely capable of violence, but he would *burn* a library, not steal from it. He did not take the book.
- **The Return:** Cornelius flies back, his list of suspects empty.
- **The Conclusion:** If it wasn't Nephele (Clumsy), Kyriakos (Alibi/Greed for Orchid not Book), Sophia (Alibi/Artist), or Orestes (Hates Books)... it *must* be Demos regardless of the lack of evidence.

**DECISIONS MADE**
- **Cornelius decides to break Theo's rule.** *Why:* He has exhausted all legal options. Obsession (Internal Axis) spikes.

**STATE CHANGES**
- **EA (External):** +8 -> +9 (Threatening). The environment itself feels hostile now.
- **IA (Internal):** +4 -> +8 (Obsessive). "It has to be Demos."
- **RA (Relationship):** -4 (Stable).

**THRESHOLD STATUS**
- **Pinch Point 1:** CROSSED. The stakes have raised from "Missing Book" to "Impending Nature Doom."

**KNOWLEDGE UPDATES**
- **Cornelius Knows:** Orestes hates books. Something bad is coming for the Orchid.
- **Reader Knows:** The Villain is still out there.

**NEXT CHAPTER SETUP**
- **Primary Pressure:** Breaking into Demos's carrel (The Heist) to prove the theory.
