## Chapter 10 State

**CHAPTER SUMMARY**
- **The Gathering:** Cornelius summons **Anthea**, **Imelda**, **Captaion Theo** (reluctantly), and **Zeph** to the main reading room.
- **The Speech:** Cornelius delivers his "Poirot Moment." He systematically dismantles the alibis of Nephele, Kyriakos, and Sophia (correctly) before turning to Demos.
- **The Accusation:** "There is only one person who had opportunity and the book. Brother Demos."
- **The Reveal:** Cornelius produces the book he "secured" from Demos's carrel. He slaps it onto the table. "Dr. Floros, your journal."
- **The Pivot:** Anthea opens it. She looks confused. "This... this is *Secret Wonders*. It's a library book."
- **The Truth:** Demos bursts into tears. "I stole it! I admit it! I needed the chapter on healing mosses for my thesis and Imelda wouldn't let me check it out!"
- **The Collapse:** The room goes silent. Cornelius stares at the book. It is the missing library book from Chapter 1. It is *not* the Botanist's Journal.
- **The Consequence:** Theo is furious. "You wasted our time and broke into a monk's carrel for an overdue library book?"
- **The State:** Demos is guilty of *petty theft*. He is cleared of the *Grand Larceny*. Cornelius's entire theory is dead. The Villain is still out there.

**DECISIONS MADE**
- **Cornelius decides to gamble everything on the reveal.** *Outcome:* Total social bankruptcy.
- **Demos decides to confess to the lesser crime.** *Outcome:* He is fined, but verified innocent of the main plot.

**STATE CHANGES**
- **EA (External):** +9 -> +5 (Deflated). The tension broke, but in the wrong way.
- **IA (Internal):** +10 -> -5 (Crushed). Hubris punishment.
- **RA (Relationship):** -4 -> -8 (Mockery). Theo is laughing (internally). Imelda is disappointed.

**THRESHOLD STATUS**
- **Midpoint (Attractor C):** CROSSED. The "False Lead" is resolved.
- **Pivot:** The investigation must restart from zero.

**KNOWLEDGE UPDATES**
- **Cornelius Knows:** Demos is innocent. The Villain is someone else.
- **Reader Knows:** The "False Gardener" warning from Orestes is now the *only* lead left.

**NEXT CHAPTER SETUP**
- **Primary Pressure:** Dealing with the fallout (Reaction Phase). Resetting the board.
