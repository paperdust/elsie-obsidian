## Chapter 05 State

**CHAPTER SUMMARY**
- **The Event:** Cornelius triggers "Code Obsidian" (Lockdown).
- **The Consequence:** The alarm summons **Captain Theo**.
- **The Accusation:** Cornelius accuses Demos of theft.
- **The Fail:** Demos has already hidden the book (*Secret Wonders*) in the stacks. He is clean.
- **The Verdict:** Theo finds no evidence. He reprimands Cornelius for "Harassing a Monk" and "Misuse of Watch Alarms."
- **The Blockade:** Theo forbids Cornelius from investigating Demos further without hard proof.
- **The Exit:** Demos leaves (free). Zeph leaves (late for date). Cornelius is left alone with the humiliating silence of his own library.

**DECISIONS MADE**
- **Cornelius decides to use force (Lockdown)**. *Outcome:* Backfire. Social Status penalty.
- **Theo decides to protect the citizen (Demos)** against the "Bully Dragon." *Why:* Duty + Annoyance at Cornelius.

**STATE CHANGES**
- **EA (External):** +6 -> +8 (Hostile). The Law is now an obstacle, not an ally.
- **IA (Internal):** +7 -> +2 (Humiliated/Cold Fury). The fire is gone; only cold calculation remains.
- **RA (Relationship):** -6 (Fractured). Zeph is gone.

**THRESHOLD STATUS**
- **Threshold 1 (The Lockdown):** CROSSED.
- **Result:** FAILURE. The Detective has lost status.

**KNOWLEDGE UPDATES**
- **Cornelius Knows:** Demos is guilty (intuition). Demos hid the book in the library (deduction).
- **Reader Knows:** Cornelius is right about the *hiding*, but wrong about the *book*.

**NEXT CHAPTER SETUP**
- **Primary Pressure:** Finding the hidden book in the library (Needle in a Haystack) without alerting Theo.
