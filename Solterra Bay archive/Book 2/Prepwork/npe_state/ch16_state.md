## Chapter 16 State

**CHAPTER SUMMARY**
- **The Obstacle:** The streets are a solid wall of tourists, musicians, and dancers. Movement is impossible.
- **The Solution:** Cornelius points up. "The roof, Zeph."
- **The Ascent:** They climb the drainpipe of the Bakery. Zeph is terrified but motivated by the "Extinction Threat."
- **The Journey:** A frantic race across the slate tiles of Solterra Bay.
    - *Challenge 1:* slippery moss on the shaded side.
    - *Challenge 2:* A gap between the Library and the Clock Tower.
- **The Jump:** Cornelius can glide, but he can't carry Zeph's weight across the gap. Zeph has to jump.
- **The Character Moment:** Zeph hesitates. Cornelius doesn't mock him. "You studied the physics of flight, Zeph. Trust the math." Zeph jumps. He barely makes it.
- **The Goal:** They reach the edge of the town, overlooking the trailhead.
- **The Sighting:** They see **Team Ground** (Sophia/Orestes) fighting through the last of the crowd below. They see **Kyriakos's Lantern** bobbing halfway up the cliff path.
- **The Status:** They have bypassed the gridlock, but the Villain still has the high ground.

**DECISIONS MADE**
- **Zeph decides to jump.** *Why:* To save the Orchid (Bravery).
- **Cornelius decides to treat Zeph as a partner, not a burden.** *Why:* Respect for the jump.
