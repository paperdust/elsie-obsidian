## Chapter 12 State

**CHAPTER SUMMARY**
- **The Festival:** "Twinkle Nights" begins. Solterra Bay goes dark, lit only by millions of bioluminescent beetles. The atmosphere is magical and chaotic.
- **The Date:** Zeph and Sophia are walking fast, doing that awkward "touching hands by accident" thing.
- **The Chaperone:** Cornelius is following them, wearing a ridiculous festive bow tie Imelda forced on him. He is miserable. He eats a cricket that lands on his nose.
- **The Observation:** While Zeph and Sophia are distracted by the fireworks, Cornelius scans the crowd. He expects to see **Kyriakos** at the center of the VIP tent, soaking up adulation.
- **The Anomaly:** Kyriakos is not in the tent. Cornelius spots him *slipping away* from the party. He is wearing dark clothes (not his usual silk) and carrying a heavy canvas bag. He is heading not towards his hotel, but towards the **Cliff Path**.
- **The Realization:** Why would a narcissist leave his own party? Why dress like a thief?
- **The Decision:** Cornelius abandons the Chaperone duty. "Zeph is fine. The game is afoot."

**DECISIONS MADE**
- **Cornelius decides to abandon Zeph** to follow Kyriakos. *Why:* Suspicion/Duty.
- **Zeph decides to kiss Sophia** (off-screen, implied). *Why:* Atmosphere + Lack of Dragon supervision.

**STATE CHANGES**
- **EA (External):** +5 -> +8 (Darkness/Stealth). The environment is now cover.
- **IA (Internal):** -7 -> +5 (Re-ignited). The depression vanishes. The hunt is back.
- **RA (Relationship):** -6 -> -1 (Ignore). Zeph is forgotten.

**THRESHOLD STATUS**
- **Investigation:** REOPENED. The target is Kyriakos.

**KNOWLEDGE UPDATES**
- **Cornelius Knows:** Kyriakos is sneaking to the cliffs with a bag.
- **Reader Knows:** Trouble is coming to Orestes.

**NEXT CHAPTER SETUP**
