## Chapter 20 State

**CHAPTER SUMMARY**
- **The Morning:** The Library is open. Sunlight streams in.
- **The Return:** Cornelius places the **Journal** on Anthea's desk.
- **The Revelation:** Anthea weeps. "I thought I was stripped of my legacy." Cornelius: "It was merely misplaced." (He spares her the details of the theft to protect her dignity? No, he tells her the truth to validate her work).
- **The Punishment:** **Demos** is scrubbing the floor. Imelda made him do it for "Unauthorized Carrel Use." He is miserable but grateful not to be in jail.
- **The Trophy:** Cornelius places the **Welded Stasis Jar** (empty of scent now, as the gas dissipated/neutralized, or kept as a memento?) No, he keeps it on his shelf. "The Day I Sealed the Wind."
- **The End:** Zeph is humming. Imelda brings Cornelius a cup of chamomile tea.
- **The Closing Image:** Cornelius opens his ledger. He picks up his quill. "Item 4,502: Resolved." He is a dragon in his hoard. All is well.

**DECISIONS MADE**
- **Cornelius decides to keep the Jar.** *Why:* Hoarding positive memories.
