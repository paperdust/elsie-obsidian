## Chapter 17 State

**CHAPTER SUMMARY**
- **The Convergence:** Cornelius and Zeph (Roof Team) intercept Sophia and Orestes (Market Team) at the halfway switchback. The Festival is a dull roar below.
- **The Situation:** They are 10 minutes from the top. Kyriakos is already there. The faint smell of Synthetic Musk drifts down—he has opened his containment suit/gear.
- **The Problem:** They cannot physically fight him (Cozy Physics). They cannot just smash the jar (it releases the evidence, and Kyriakos can claim he was just "watching flowers").
- **The Epiphany:** Sophia examines the shard again. "The lid. It's a screw-top with a lead gasket for the vacuum seal. Lead has a low melting point."
- **The Plan:** If Cornelius heats the *lid* ring, the lead will melt and fuse the jar shut instantly.
    1.  Kyriakos captures the gas/scent (Evidence of Poaching).
    2.  Cornelius welds it shut *before* Kyriakos can hide it or vent it.
    3.  Kyriakos is caught holding a permanently sealed jar of illegal pheromones.
- **The Subplot Climax:** Zeph realizes he has to distract Kyriakos to give Cornelius a clear shot at the jar. "I'll talk to him. I'm boring. I can bore him to death."

**DECISIONS MADE**
- **Cornelius decides to use 'Precision Breath'** (a jeweler's flame) rather than a fireball. *Why:* Control.
- **Zeph decides to be the distraction.** *Why:* Self-sacrifice.

**STATE CHANGES**
- **EA (External):** +10 (Climax).
- **IA (Internal):** +10 (Ready). The mechanics of the solution are clear.
- **RA (Relationship):** +10 (Unified).

**THRESHOLD STATUS**
- **Epiphany:** MET. The "How" is solved.

**KNOWLEDGE UPDATES**
- **Cornelius Knows:** Melt the lead gasket.
- **Reader Knows:** The trap is set.

**NEXT CHAPTER SETUP**
- **Primary Pressure:** The Summit. The Showdown.
