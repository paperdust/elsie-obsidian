## Chapter 06 State

**CHAPTER SUMMARY**
- **The Morning After:** The Library is quiet. Cornelius is cleaning the floor where Demos stood, seething. Theo's "Restraining Order" (informal) is in effect.
- **The Strategy:** Cornelius cannot touch Demos. So he decides to "Eliminate the Impossible." If he investigates the *other* suspects and proves them innocent, Theo *must* accept Demos is the only one left.
- **Target 1: Kyriakos Vlahos.** Cornelius finds him at the **Festival Pavilion**, overseeing the setup of his "Scent Experience."
- **The Interview:** Kyriakos is arrogant, dismissive, and culturally superior. He insults Cornelius's scale polish.
- **The Alibi:** Kyriakos claims he was "sourcing ambergris" during the theft.
- **The Clue (Hidden):** Cornelius notices Kyriakos is wearing a very specific, very expensive **Velvet Scarf**. It smells of the same *Synthetic Musk* found in Anthea's room.
- **The Deduction:** Kyriakos *was* in the room (or his scent was). But he didn't take the book; he was there looking for the Orchid (Greed).
- **The Conflict:** Kyriakos offers to "buy" the library if Cornelius stops bothering him. Cornelius is insulted (Pride).

**DECISIONS MADE**
- **Cornelius decides to investigate Kyriakos** to clear the board for Demos. *Outcome:* Finds a connection (Scent), but no Journal.
- **Kyriakos decides to bribe Cornelius.** *Outcome:* Fails. Increases Hostility.

**STATE CHANGES**
- **EA (External):** +8 (Hostile). Theo is watching.
- **IA (Internal):** +2 -> +3 (Focused/Cold). The humiliation is fueling the detective work.
- **RA (Relationship):** -6 -> -5 (Recovering). Zeph is still mad, but curious about the "Scent."

**THRESHOLD STATUS**
- **Act 2 Investigation:** UNDERWAY.

**KNOWLEDGE UPDATES**
- **Cornelius Knows:** Kyriakos smells like the crime scene. Kyriakos is looking for the Orchid.
- **Reader Knows:** Kyriakos is the Villain, but for *theft of flowers*, not necessarily the book (yet).

**NEXT CHAPTER SETUP**
- **Primary Pressure:** Zeph's date with **Sophia** (Suspect E). Cornelius needs to "chaperone" (spy).
