- **Magic System:** "Cozy" magic (healing, structural mending, domestic). No resurrection, no combat fireballs.
- **Protagonist:** Cornelius Drake (Library Dragon). Size of a large house cat. Bronze scales.
- **Dragon Physiology:** Omniglot reading, eidetic memory (for hoard/books), breath is a tiny blue flame (tool, not weapon).

SOFT PREFERENCES
(Strong author intent, flexible if needed)
- **Vibe:** Lush, romantic, floral (specific to Book 2).
- **Cornelius's Diet:** Obsessed with fresh mint, crickets, raw fish. Disdains cooked food.
- **Zeph's Arc:** Moving from "reluctant intern" to "guardian". Currently in "awkward teen dating" phase.
- **Narrative Voice:** "Competence Porn" (watching people be good at their jobs). No cynicism.

OPEN QUESTIONS / AMBIGUITIES
(Unresolved, contradictory, or missing elements)
- **The Botanist:** Details unnamed beyond "visiting botanist" and "old friend of Imelda". Need a specific name/species.
- **The Orchid:** "Moon-Scented Orchid". Specific magical properties beyond scent? (Assumed non-magical, just rare, per "Journal isn't a magical tome").
- **The Date:** Who is Zeph trying to impress? (Can likely be a local from the Bible, e.g., Acolyte Melaina or similar, or a new character).

BOOK-LEVEL DATA
- **Book Title:** The Botanist's Journal (Solterra Bay #2)
- **Genre:** Cozy Fantasy with Strong Mystery Leaning
- **Tone / emotional register:** Warm, sensory (scent/light), low-stakes violence, high-stakes emotion. "Lush, romantic, floral."
- **Central tension (conflicting forces):** Preservation (Hermit/Botanist) vs. Commodification (Perfumer).
- **Stakes:**
    - *External:* Loss of the rare orchid species; corruption of the Twinkle Nights festival.
    - *Internal (Cornelius):* Desire for the rare book vs. annoyance at the chaos.
    - *Internal (Zeph):* Social anxiety vs. desire to impress his date.
- **Ending intention:** The Journal is recovered; the Orchid is safe (likely hidden again); Zeph survives his date; Cornelius gets his copy.

PROTAGONIST: CORNELIUS DRAKE
- **want:** To find the Journal (for the hoard).

- **dominant vectors:** V_Greed +8, V_Duty +9, V_Annoyance -7.

RELATIONSHIP DYNAMICS
- **Cornelius & Zeph:** Mentor/Student (Grumpy). Zeph needs advice (flowers), Cornelius gives terrible/dragony advice.

WORLD / SETTING ANCHORS
- **The Backdrop Event:** "The Twinkle Nights" (Bioluminescent firefly swarm). Massive tourist influx.
- **Locations:** The Library (Home Base), The Wilds/Cliffs (Orchid habitat), The Market/Festival Grounds.
- **Rules:** "Cozy" rules apply. No gore.

GENRE-SPECIFIC EXTENSIONS (COZY MYSTERY MODULE v1.2)
- **Extension name:** Solterra Cozy Physics
  - **justification:** Enforced by 'cozy_mystery.md' module.
  - **key variables:**
    - **Lethality:** ZERO (Physical).
    - **Social Lethality:** HIGH (Shame/Scandal is the weapon).
    - **The Fishbowl:** Gossip travels instantly.
    - **Motive Constraint:** Must be Greed, Pride, or Jealousy. (Perfumer = Greed).
    - **Pacing:** 4-Act Grid (Setup, Investigation, Twist, Showdown).

NPE READINESS NOTES
- **RDL completeness score (0-10):** 8/10
- **most underdefined force:** The specific mechanics of the "crime" (the theft of the journal). Who stole it? The Perfumer? Or lost by accident and *found* by the wrong person? (Assume theft for mystery).
- **highest risk ambiguity:** Zeph's date needs a specific identity to anchor the subplot.
- **recommended next step:** Create the Story Bible update for Book 2 characters (Botanist, Perfumer, Hermit) and map the 4-Act structure.
