MODULE: Cozy-Mystery-v1.2

=== 1. PHYSICS CONSTANTS (IMPORTED) ===
*   **Lethality (Physical):** 0.0 (BANNED).
*   **Lethality (Social):** 1.5 (High - Shame is the weapon).
*   **Elasticity:** 0.95 (Must return to status quo).
*   **Growth Rate:** 0.2 (Slow).
*   **Fishbowl Effect:** Active (Gossip Speed = Instant).

=== 2. INITIAL AXIS POSITIONS ===
*   **Internal Axis (IA):** 0 (Stable/Bored). Cornelius is in his comfort zone (the library) but seeking stimulation (the journal).
*   **Relationship Axis (RA):** -2 (Strain). Zeph is mentally "checked out" preparing for his date with **Sophia Doukas**; Cornelius resents the lack of attention.
*   **External Axis (EA):** -1 (Rising Chaos). The Festival setup is creating noise and disruption outside the library walls.
*   **Temporal Axis (TA):** 0.0 (The Inciting Incident has not yet hit).

=== 3. CORE VECTORS (FORCES) ===
*   **Cornelius:**
    *   `V_Greed (Rare Books)`: +8 (Strong Pull). Driven by the promise of the Journal.
    *   `V_Protectiveness (Imelda)`: +9 (Dominant). Will act if she asks.
    *   `V_Annoyance (Tourists)`: -7 (Resistance). Wants to stay inside to avoid the "Twinkle" crowds.
*   **Zeph:**
    *   `V_Anxiety (Sophia)`: +8 (Distracting). Intimidated by her talent/class.
    *   `V_Duty (The Library)`: +3 (Weak). Overpowered by social anxiety.
*   **Kyriakos (Villain):**
    *   `V_Greed (Wealth)`: +9.
    *   `V_Pride (Legacy)`: +8.
    *   `V_Haste`: +6 (The orchids only bloom during the festival).

=== 4. FIELDS (ENVIRONMENTAL MODIFIERS) ===
*   **Field: The Twinkle Nights Festival**
    *   *Strength:* 8/10.
    *   *Effect:* **Amplifies** Social Anxiety and Chaos. **Suppresses** Stealth (too many people watching) but **Aids** anonymity (crowds).
    *   *Lighting:* **Darkness** enforced by law (to see fireflies).
*   **Field: The Gossip Network**
    *   *Strength:* 9/10.
    *   *Effect:* High Conductivity. If Zeph messes up his date, the whole town knows by morning.

=== 5. MOMENTUM & ENTROPY ===
*   **Momentum:** 0 (Static). The story needs a push (Theft).
*   **Entropy:** 2 (Low). Order still prevails in the library.

=== 6. ANTICIPATED THRESHOLDS ===
*   **Inciting Incident (Ch 2-3):** Theft of the Journal / Identification of the stakes.
*   **Midpoint (Ch 10):** The Orchid is found (or nearly found) and the villain escalates.
*   **Climax (Ch 18):** Showdown at the Widow's Perch during the peak of the firefly swarm.

=== 7. KNOWLEDGE BASELINE ===
*   **Cornelius Knows:** Imelda's friend **Anthea** is visiting. A book in the *Herbology* section is missing (count is off).
*   **Zeph Knows:** He has a date with **Sophia**. He knows nothing about orchids.
*   **Reader Knows:** The Orchid is real. **Kyriakos** is dangerous.

=== DRAFTING READINESS CHECK ===
*   **Completeness:** 9/10.
*   **Risk:** Balancing the "Date Subplot" with the "Mystery Plot" (Zeph interfering).
*   **Next Step:** Generate Chapter Outline (Threshold Plan).
