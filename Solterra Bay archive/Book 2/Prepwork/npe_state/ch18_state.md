## Chapter 18 State

**CHAPTER SUMMARY**
- **The Summit:** The **Widow's Perch**. The **Orchid** is fully open, glowing purple and pulsing. The air is thick with a scent like vanilla and ozone (The Release).
- **The Villain:** Kyriakos is there. He has the **Stasis Jar** inverted over the flower, pumping the heavy gas into the glass chamber. He is euphoric.
- **The Distraction:** Zeph stumbles into the clearing. "Mr. Vlahos! Sir! Wait! Is that the Vlahos-7 Containment Unit?"
- **The Pause:** Kyriakos freezes, then preens. "It is the Vlahos-1, actually. The prototype. Who are you?"
- **The Trap:** While Kyriakos lectures Zeph on the "flaws of borosilicate," he doesn't hear the dragon creeping up the limestone face behind him.
- **The Strike:** Cornelius lunges. He doesn't bite. He exhales. A needle-thin jet of blue flame hits the **Lead Gasket** of the jar.
- **The Weld:** The lead liquifies instantly. The lid fuses to the glass body. *Hiss.*
- **The Realization:** Kyriakos drops the jar in shock. It doesn't break (reinforced). It rolls on the grass.
- **The Checkmate:** Kyriakos tries to open it to dump the evidence. The lid won't budge. He pulls a knife (Crisis).
- **The Defense:** Orestes steps out of the shadows. "Do not cut the root, gardener."
- **The Stand:** Kyriakos is surrounded. He holds the jar (Evidence) but cannot destroy it. He is trapped by his own unbreakable design.

**DECISIONS MADE**
- **Kyriakos decides to fight.** *Why:* Desperation.
- **Cornelius decides to hold his fire.** *Why:* No Lethality Rule.

**STATE CHANGES**
- **EA (External):** +10 (Victory). The threat is neutralized.
- **IA (Internal):** +10 (Triumph). Hoard protected.
- **RA (Relationship):** +10 (Zeph is a Hero).

**THRESHOLD STATUS**
- **Act 4 Showdown:** WON. The Villain is captured.

**KNOWLEDGE UPDATES**
- **Cornelius Knows:** The jar is sealed.
- **Reader Knows:** The Orchid is safe.

**NEXT CHAPTER SETUP**
- **Primary Pressure:** The Resolution (Ch 19). Theo arriving to make the arrest.
