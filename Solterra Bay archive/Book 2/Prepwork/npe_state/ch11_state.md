## Chapter 11 State

**CHAPTER SUMMARY**
- **The Hangover:** The day after the "Great Librarian Failure." Cornelius is hiding in his office, cataloging paperclips to avoid eye contact with anyone.
- **The Doubt:** Anthea Floros comes to see him. She is kind, which is worse than anger. She admits: "Cornelius... I am old. Stickney's Syndrome runs in my family. Perhaps... perhaps I *did* leave it on a rock? Maybe there is no thief."
- **The Low Point:** This crushes Cornelius. If there is no thief, his grand investigation was just bullying. He agrees to stop the "criminal" search and just treat it as "Lost Property."
- **The Subplot (Zeph):** Zeph is incredibly anxious about the Festival Opening Night. He has a second date with Sophia. He begs Cornelius to come. "You're good at spotting details! Stop me from saying dumb things!"
- **The Agreement:** Cornelius agrees, mostly to get out of the library where Imelda is giving him "The Look." He will "Chaperone" the date.

**DECISIONS MADE**
- **Anthea decides to withdraw the accusation of theft.** *Why:* Shame/Doubt about her own memory.
- **Cornelius decides to abandon the 'Detective' role.** *Why:* Humiliation.
- **Cornelius decides to Chaperone.** *Why:* Need for distraction.

**STATE CHANGES**
- **EA (External):** +5 (Stable).
- **IA (Internal):** -5 -> -7 (Depressed).
- **RA (Relationship):** -8 -> -6 (Pity). Zeph actually feels bad for Cornelius.

**THRESHOLD STATUS**
- **Act 3:** STARTED.
- **Goal:** Survive the Festival.

**KNOWLEDGE UPDATES**
- **Cornelius Knows:** Anthea doubts herself.
- **Reader Knows:** The "Musk" clue and Orestes's warning are still unresolved crimes.

**NEXT CHAPTER SETUP**
- **Primary Pressure:** The Festival Opening (Ch 12). Watching Kyriakos (who will be there).
