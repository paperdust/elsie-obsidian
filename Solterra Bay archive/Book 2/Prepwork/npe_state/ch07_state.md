## Chapter 07 State

**CHAPTER SUMMARY**
- **The Date:** Zeph meets **Sophia Doukas** at the Festival Market. He is nervous. Cornelius is watching from a gargoyle perch on a nearby roof (Chaperone Mode).
- **The Investigation:** Cornelius focuses his senses on Sophia. Does she smell of Musk? (No, she smells of turpentine). Does she have the book? (Her satchel is too flat).
- **The Conversation:** Zeph tries his "Latin Orchid" lines. Sophia laughs (kindly) and tells him to stop trying so hard. She talks about her work.
- **The Clue (Motive):** Sophia rants about **Kyriakos**. "He stole my bottle designs! He creates nothing; he just takes."
- **The Clue (Alibi):** She mentions she was at the **Widow's Perch** all morning painting the sunrise. She shows Zeph the sketches. The time stamps/light angles prove she was miles away from the Guest House during the theft.
- **The Glass:** Sophia drops a sketch. As Zeph picks it up, he sees a diagram of a **Stasis Jar** (though he doesn't know what it is yet). It looks like the glass shards Cornelius found earlier? No, Cornelius is too far away to see the detail. The reader sees it.
- **Cornelius's Verdict:** Sophia has a grudge against Kyriakos, but she didn't steal the Journal. She is cleared.

**DECISIONS MADE**
- **Sophia decides to trust Zeph** slightly. *Why:* He is clumsy but honest.
- **Cornelius decides to clear Sophia.** *Why:* Alibi (Sketches) + Lack of Opportunity.

**STATE CHANGES**
- **EA (External):** +8 (Stable).
- **IA (Internal):** +3 -> +4 (Narrowing). List of suspects is shrinking.
- **RA (Relationship):** -5 -> -4 (Thawing). Zeph actually survived the date.

**THRESHOLD STATUS**
- **Act 2 Investigation:** Continuing.
- **Suspects Cleared:** Nephele (Ch 4), Kyriakos (Ch 6 - sort of), Sophia (Ch 7).
- **Next Target:** Orestes (Suspect C).

**KNOWLEDGE UPDATES**
- **Cornelius Knows:** Sophia hates Kyriakos. Sophia was at Widow's Perch.
- **Zeph Knows:** Sophia is "intense" about glass.

**NEXT CHAPTER SETUP**
- **Primary Pressure:** Investigating Orestes (The Hermit) who lives near the crime scene.
