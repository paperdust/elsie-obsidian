## Chapter 14 State

**CHAPTER SUMMARY**
- **The Regroup:** Cornelius flies Orestes (who hates it) back to the **Festival Pavilion** to find Zeph and Sophia.
- **The Team:** Zeph is terrified by the mossy hermit. Sophia is fascinated.
- **The Evidence:** Cornelius shows them the **Glass Shard** from the cliff.
- **The Expert:** Sophia gasps. "This isn't just glass. This is *Borosilicate*. It's my design! The Protocol 7 Stasis Jar!"
- **The Explanation:** She explains the jar is designed to hold *volatile gases* under high pressure without reacting. It's used for capturing rare perfumes at the source.
- **The Connection:** Kyriakos commissioned it, then claimed the project failed. He stole the prototypes.
- **The Motive:** Kyriakos isn't stealing the book for the book's sake. He stole the Journal to find the *breeding cycle* of the Orchid. He needs to know exactly when it releases its pheromones so he can capture the "Scent of Extinction" in Sophia's unbreakable jar.
- **The Stakes:** If he bottles the scent, the beetle pollinators won't be attracted. The Orchid will die without reproducing. Extinction.

**DECISIONS MADE**
- **Sophia decides to help.** *Why:* Revenge for her stolen design + Protecting Art.
- **Zeph decides to act.** *Why:* Protecting the flower (Botany).
- **Cornelius decides to lead the defense.** *Why:* Protecting the Hoard (The Knowledge/Species).

- **IA (Internal):** +8 -> +10 (Clarified). The enemy is defined. The mission is clear.
