## Chapter 02 State

**CHAPTER SUMMARY**
- **Dr. Anthea Floros** enters the library in a state of high distress. She is disheveled, leaves falling from her hair (Dryad-touched trait).
- She confesses to Cornelius and Imelda: **The Botanist's Journal is gone.** She had it at the Sea View Guest House this morning, went for a walk, and now it is missing.
- **Imelda** immediately goes into "Protector Mode," tasking Cornelius with recovering it.
- **Cornelius** is skeptical ("You probably left it on a stump, Anthea"). He moves to the window to gauge the crowd density before agreeing to go out.
- **The Sighting:** Through the window, Cornelius sees **Brother Demos** hurrying away from the direction of the Guest House. Demos is clutching a dark, leather-bound book to his chest, looking terrified and checking over his shoulder.
- **The Conflation:** Cornelius recognizes the book's size/color as matching *Secret Wonders* (the missing library book). But in the context of Anthea's panic, his brain makes a fatal error: *Demos has The Book.* He assumes Demos stole the Journal.
- Cornelius accepts the case, fueled by the desire to catch the thief and recover the "Rare Item" (for himself/Imelda).

**DECISIONS MADE**
- **Cornelius decides to accept the case**, but focuses entirely on Demos as the prime suspect. *Why:* Confirmation Bias (V_Pride) + Visual Confirmation.
- **Anthea decides to lie by omission** about *intent*. She implies theft, but hides her fear that she lost it. *Why:* Shame (Social Status).

**STATE CHANGES**
- **EA (External):** +1 -> +3 (Active). The "Crime" has officially occurred.
- **IA (Internal):** +1 (Annoyed) -> +4 (Hunting). Cornelius switches from passive grumpiness to predator mode.
- **Vector Activation:** `V_Greed` (Cornelius wants the book) and `V_Duty` (Imelda's order) align.

**THRESHOLD STATUS**
- **Inciting Incident:** CROSSED (Theft Reported).
- **Threshold 1 (The Lockdown):** Projected for Ch 5.

**KNOWLEDGE UPDATES**
- **Cornelius Knows (FALSE):** Brother Demos stole the Botanist's Journal. (CRITICAL ERROR: Demos has *Secret Wonders*).
- **Reader Knows:** Cornelius is making an assumption based on coincidence.

**NEXT CHAPTER SETUP**
- **Primary Pressure:** Catching Demos. But first, investigating the "Crime Scene" to confirm details.
