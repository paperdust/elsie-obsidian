## Chapter 03 State

**CHAPTER SUMMARY**
- **Cornelius** and **Zeph** travel to the **Sea View Guest House**.
- They are greeted by **Nephele (Suspect F)**, who is managing the desk while her cousin is away. She is loud, smells of brine, and is heavily in debt (cornelius overhears her arguing about a loan).
- **The Crime Scene:** Anthea's room is chaos. Plant cuttings everywhere.
- **The Clue:** Cornelius smells a pungent, expensive scent on the windowsill: *Synthetic Musk and Ambergris*. It revolts him.
- **The Missed Connection:** He assumes the smell is from a "city cleaning agent" or Anthea's own toiletries. He ignores it to focus on the window latch (which was forced).
- **Sophia Doukas (Suspect E)** is spotted on the patio below, sketching the cliffs. Zeph has a meltdown ("She's looking at the light! She's radiant!").
- Cornelius drags Zeph away, now fully convinced Demos broke in through the window (despite Demos being small and the window being high).

**DECISIONS MADE**
- **Cornelius decides to ignore the Scent Clue** because it doesn't fit his "Demos Theory." *Why:* Cognitive Dissonance (Structure).
- **Zeph decides to hide behind a pillar** rather than say hello to Sophia. *Why:* V_Anxiety (+9).

**STATE CHANGES**
- **EA (External):** +3 (Stable).
- **IA (Internal):** +4 -> +5 (Confident). Cornelius feels he has confirmed the mechanics of the crime (Forced Entry).
- **RA (Relationship):** -3 (Stable). Zeph is useless, but Cornelius is getting used to it.

**THRESHOLD STATUS**
- **Threshold 1 (The Lockdown):** Approaching.

**KNOWLEDGE UPDATES**
- **Cornelius Knows:** The thief entered via the window. Nephele owes money.
- **Reader Knows:** The Musk is important (Kyriakos's trail). Cornelius is tunnel-visioned.

**NEXT CHAPTER SETUP**
- **Primary Pressure:** Interviewing the locals (Nephele) before moving to Demos.
