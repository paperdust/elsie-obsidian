## Chapter 04 State

**CHAPTER SUMMARY**
- **Zeph's Valley:** Back at the library, Zeph is frantically trying to memorize a botany textbook to impress **Sophia**. He is reciting Latin names ("*Orchis mascula*").
- **Cornelius's Critique:** Cornelius tells him he's doing it wrong. "She is an artist, Zeph. She cares about the *pigment*, not the phylum." Zeph ignores him, convinced that "smart words" = "attractive."
- **The Interview:** Cornelius leaves Zeph to his doom and goes to the Docks to find **Nephele**.
- **The Docks:** Chaos. Fish Everywhere. Cornelius hates it (Smell Axis spike).
- **Nephele's Alibi:** She admits she *was* at the Guest House early, but only to deliver a crate of "Premium Oysters" to **Kyriakos's** private carriage driver.
- **The Connection:** This connects Nephele to Kyriakos (Suspect F -> Suspect B). It also confirms Kyriakos is spending a fortune on luxury food while in town.
- **Cornelius's Deduction:** Nephele is too loud and clumsy to be a ninja thief. She is cleared as the *Primary* suspect but remains a person of interest for the *Debt*.

**DECISIONS MADE**
- **Zeph decides to ignore Cornelius's advice** on how to talk to girls. *Why:* Insecurity.
- **Cornelius decides to clear Nephele** of the physical theft. *Why:* Assessment of her physical stats (Clumsiness > Agility).

**STATE CHANGES**
- **EA (External):** +3 (Stable).
- **IA (Internal):** +5 -> +4 (Focused). The Docks smelled bad, lowering his mood slightly.
- **RA (Relationship):** -3 -> -4 (Distant). Cornelius thinks Zeph is an idiot for memorizing Latin.

**THRESHOLD STATUS**
- **Threshold 1 (The Lockdown):** Approaching (Next Chapter).

**KNOWLEDGE UPDATES**
- **Cornelius Knows:** Nephele works for Kyriakos occasionally. Kyriakos is in town and spending money.
- **Zeph Knows:** *Orchis mascula* means "Male Orchid." (Useless fact).

**NEXT CHAPTER SETUP**
- **Primary Pressure:** The Lockdown. Gathering everyone to squeeze for the truth about Demos.
