## Chapter 09 State

**CHAPTER SUMMARY**
- **The Heist:** Cornelius waits until the library closes. Zeph is sent home. The Watch guard is dozing outside.
- **The Infiltration:** Cornelius uses his small size to navigate the **Ventilation Shafts** (Dragon Mode) to bypass the locked gate to the Study Carrels.
- **The Lock:** He picks the lock on Demos's private carrel. It is a violation of the Librarian's Code, but "Justice demands it."
- **The Discovery:** Inside, buried under a pile of theological scrolls, is the **Dark Leather Book**.
- **The Confirmation (False):** Cornelius doesn't open it (fear of damaging evidence/noise). He just sees the binding. It matches the description of the Journal perfectly.
- **The Triumph:** Cornelius retreats, heart racing. He has done it. He has proven he is smarter than the Watch, smarter than the thief. He decides to confront Demos publicly tomorrow morning when the library opens.

**DECISIONS MADE**
- **Cornelius decides to break into the carrel.** *Why:* Hubris. He believes he is above the law because he *is* the Library.
- **Cornelius decides NOT to open the book yet.** *Why:* He wants the "Moment" of the reveal to be witnessed by Imelda and Anthea. (Showmanship).

**STATE CHANGES**
- **EA (External):** +9 (High Tension). The calm before the storm.
- **IA (Internal):** +8 -> +10 (Peak Hubris). He is invincible.
- **RA (Relationship):** -4 (Stable).

**THRESHOLD STATUS**
- **Threshold 2 (The False Confession):** ARMED. The trap is set for Chapter 10.

**KNOWLEDGE UPDATES**
- **Cornelius Knows:** Demos has the book in his carrel.
- **Reader Knows:** Cornelius is walking into a trap of his own making (The Conflation Error).

**NEXT CHAPTER SETUP**
- **Primary Pressure:** The Midpoint Confrontation. "J'accuse."
