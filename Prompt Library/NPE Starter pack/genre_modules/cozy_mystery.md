# NPE MODULE: COZY MYSTERY
# VERSION: 1.2 (Hybrid: TaylorWraith Framework + NPE Physics)
# UNITS:
#   - Vectors (Directional Force): -10 to +10 (e.g. V_Duty +8)
#   - Field Strength (Environment): 0 to 10 (e.g. Tension 8/10)
#   - Coefficients (Damping/Friction): 0.0 to 1.0

## 1. PHYSICS CONSTANTS (The Coefficients)
These values determine how forces transfer energy in the simulation.

*   **Lethality (Physical):** ZERO (Coefficient: 0.0).
    *   *Rule:* Deadly force is BANNED. No graphic violence. No harm to animals, children, or vulnerable adults.
    *   *NPE Effect:* Any "Violence" vector is multiplied by 0.0 before applying to state.
*   **Lethality (Social):** HIGH (Coefficient: 1.5).
    *   *Rule:* Shame and public embarrassment function as critical "wounds".
    *   *NPE Effect:* Social vectors are amplified (150% impact).
*   **Elasticity:** EXTREME (0.95).
    *   *Rule:* The "Episodic Invariant". The world MUST return to a recognizable status quo. No "big life changes" that break the series premise.
*   **Character Growth Rate:** SLOW (0.2).
    *   *Rule:* Flat Arc preferred. Characters grow by inches, not miles.
*   **Magic/Tech Cost:** LOW-SOFT.
    *   *Rule:* Magic/Tech is for convenience or wonder, not primarily for combat.

## 2. TOPOLOGY (The Attractors)
These are immutable gravity wells. The plot *must* curve through these points.

*   **Attractor A: The Cozy Equilibrium (Start)**
    *   *Requirement:* Establish the warmth/value of the world *before* breaking it.
*   **Attractor B: The Intrusion (Inciting Incident)**
    *   *Requirement:* A crime enters the sanctuary. Note: The crime itself must NOT be described graphically. Focus on the *puzzle*, not the gore.
*   **Attractor C: The False Suspect/Lead (Midpoint)**
    *   *Requirement:* The protagonist pursues a theory that is socially logical but factually wrong (Usually Suspect D).
*   **Attractor D: The Community Rally (Climax)**
    *   *Requirement:* The solution requires leveraging relationships or specific community knowledge.
*   **Attractor E: The Restoration (Resolution)**
    *   *Requirement:* Order is restored. The villain is removed (Jail, not Death). The team is safe. The "Episode" ends where it began (emotionally).

## 3. FIELD GENERATORS (Setting Rules)
*   **Field: The Content Filter (Damping Field)**
    *   *Strength:* 10/10 (Absolute).
    *   *Effect:* The active suppression of "Ugly" realities. Curse words, gore, and grit are filtered out by the narrative voice itself.
*   **Field: Gossip Network (Conductivity Field)**
    *   *Conductivity:* High (8/10).
    *   *Mechanism:* **Background Diffusion (Off-Screen).** NOT a visible entity or "hive mind".
    *   *Constraint:* The Sleuth cannot "watch" gossip happen or "tap into" a frequency. It is an ambient force.
    *   *Effect:* **Lag-less Availability.** If a secret is shared with >1 person, the NEXT person the Sleuth meets *already knows it*. The Sleuth encounters the *result* (knowledge), not the process (transmission). Secrets decay rapidly (+5 Entropy/Chapter).
*   **Field: The Aesthetic (Resistance Field)**
    *   *Strength:* 8/10.
    *   *Effect:* The setting actively resists "ugly" actions. Villains must be "Elegant" or "Clean".

## 4. ARCHETYPES (Roles)
*   **The Sleuth:** (Protagonist)
    *   *Traits:* Proactive (must save self), has a unique "Special Skill" (Monk/Psych style), specific "Quirk/Pet Peeve" (10+ list).
    *   *Internal:* Must have a "Personal Drive" (Why solving matters) and an "Internal Conflict Question" (e.g., "Can I be an adult?").
    *   *Job:* Community-centered, sensory, flexible hours, access to gossip (e.g., Baker, Florist, Librarian).
*   **The Sidekick:** (The Heart/Foil)
    *   *Traits:* Friendly, sounding board. MUST have opposite skills/temperament to the Sleuth (e.g., Zany vs Practical).
*   **The Authority Figure:** (The Detective)
    *   *Traits:* Straight shooter, rule-follower.
    *   *Dynamic:* High tension with Sleuth ("Push-Pull"). Represents legal obstacles. Access to official info.
*   **The Suspects (The "Flower" Roles):**
    *   *Topology:* All suspects must be interconnected (Venn diagram). Everyone has a secret/lie.
    *   **Suspect A (The Anchor):** VICTIM #1. Dies at the Start (Attractor B).
    *   **Suspect D (The False Target):** VICTIM #2 (or proven innocent). Center of attention until Midpoint (Attractor C). *Crucial:* Sleuth MUST suspect D killed A.
    *   **Roles B, C, E, F:** The remaining pool. Valid suspects with secrets.
*   **The Intruder:** (Antagonist/Murderer)
    *   *Nature:* One of the suspects. Creates obstacles through secrets and lies.

## 5. SETTING PHYSICS (The "Closed Community")
*   **The Fishbowl Effect:** Everyone knows everyone. Secrets decay rapidly due to gossip.
*   **The Backdrop Event:** Each story MUST anchor on a community event (Fair, Carnival, Competition) that pulls people together and justifies outsider presence.

## 8. STRUCTURAL PHYSICS (The 4-Act Grid)
*   **Grid Definition:** The story is rigidly structured into 20 Chapters (45k-55k words).
    *   **ACT 1: The Setup (Ch 1-5)**
        *   *Ch 1:* Intro Community & Sleuth. **Establish Internal Question.** **Intro Backdrop.** **Intro Suspects A & B.** Constraint: Mirror Ch 20.
        *   *Ch 2: Inciting Incident.* Body Drop #1 (Suspect A). Sleuth present. **Intro Suspects C & D.**
        *   *Ch 3: The Complication.* Easy Theory Fails. Backstory link. **Intro Suspects E & F.**
        *   *Ch 4: Subplot Focus (Valley).* Development of Subplot.
        *   *Ch 5: The Big Push (Threshold).* Sleuth Decision ("Burn the Kitchen Down"). **Constraint:** All 6 Suspects MUST be on page by end of Ch 5.
    *   **ACT 2: The Investigation (Ch 6-10)**
        *   *Ch 6: Reaction & Interviews.* Reaction to Decision. First "Official" Interrogation of Suspects (A-F).
        *   *Ch 7: Deepening (Valley).* More interviews. Subplot Step 2.
        *   *Ch 8: Pinch Point #1.* Antagonist creates a setback (lost evidence/misdirection).
        *   *Ch 9: False Confidence (Valley).* Sleuth theories crystalize around **Suspect D**. Sleuth tells Sidekick "I know who it is."
        *   *Ch 10: MIDPOINT (The Pivot).* **Body Drop #2.** Suspect D is dead (or proven innocent). Sleuth's theory collapses.
    *   **ACT 3: The Crunch (Ch 11-15)**
        *   *Ch 11: The Reaction.* Confidence hit. **Ticking Clock** explicitly introduced (Urgency).
        *   *Ch 12: The Muddle/Restart (Valley).* Re-interviewing with new eyes. Subplot Midpoint.
        *   *Ch 13: Pinch Point #2 (Crisis).* "Dark Night of the Soul". Antagonist raises major obstacles. Sleuth feels overwhelmed.
        *   *Ch 14: Gathering Support (Valley).* Community helps. Evidence re-evaluated.
        *   *Ch 15: Plot Point (The Twist).* Critical overlooked evidence found. New Plan formed. Renewed hope.
    *   **ACT 4: The Showdown (Ch 16-20)**
        *   *Ch 16: Rising Challenge.* Sleuth Isolated (Sidekick gone / Detective blocked). Killer becomes Hunter.
        *   *Ch 17: The Epiphany (Valley).* Mental blocks cleared. Killer identity realized. Plan to trap/confront. Subplot Climax.
        *   *Ch 18: Pinch Point #3 (The Lair/Confrontation).* Face-to-Face with Killer. **Special Skill** MUST be key to victory.
        *   *Ch 19: The Reveal (Valley).* Public unmasking or Confession. Subplot Resolved.
        *   *Ch 20: Full Circle.* Return to Cozy World. Review Internal Question (Answered). Hook for Book 2.

*   **Drafting Constraint:** 
    *   *2 Scenes Per Chapter:* Default to TWO distinct scenes per chapter (~1125 words each).

## 9. MOTIVE PHYSICS
*   **The Constraint:** Motives must be "Cozy Compliant".
    *   *Allowed:* Greed, Jealousy, Revenge, Pride, Secret-Keeping, Adultery (Infidelity).
    *   *BANNED:* Sexual Violence/Assault, Drug Trafficking/Use (Clean dealing debatable, avoid if possible), Child Endangerment/Harm, Human Trafficking.
*   **The Relationship Rule:** The Motive must establish the "Suspect Flower" (a Venn diagram where all suspects intersect via the Motive).
*   **Clue Types:**
    *   *Physical:* Objects (buttons, tire tracks) or their absence.
    *   *Dialogue:* Gossip, lies, inconsistencies, or *omission*.
    *   *Timing:* Alibis that don't match physics.
    *   *Psychological:* Reactions (ignoring a question, anger at a name).
*   **Hiding Strategies (The "Magician's Rules"):**
    *   *List Burial:* Place the real clue in the MIDDLE of a long list.
    *   *The Rule of 3 (Red Herring):* People notice lists of 3. Use this for *Red Herrings*.
    *   *Action Distraction:* Interrupt clue discovery with high-urgency action (cat jumps).
    *   *Analogy:* Mundane event (putting on shoe) triggers realization.
*   **Fair Play Constraints:**
    *   *No Info Dumps:* Do not hide clues in walls of text.
    *   *No Obscure Knowledge:* If solution needs physics/chemistry, establish it EARLY.
    *   *Solvability:* The reader must have all the pieces by the climax.
*   **Red Herrings:**
    *   *Definition:* A valid clue that points to the wrong conclusion/suspect.

## 10. SUBPLOT PHYSICS (Topology & Rhythm)
*   **The Golden Rule:** Subplots MUST support the Main Mystery. They cannot be "sidecars"; they must be "mirrors" or "complications".
*   **Subplot Typology:**
    *   *Mirror Subplot:* Secondary characters enacted a conflict similar to the crime, teaching the Sleuth a lesson.
    *   *Complicating Subplot:* A character (e.g., Auntie Em) actively makes the investigation harder.
    *   *Backstory Subplot:* Past events surface to explain the Sleuth's "Why" or "Skill".
    *   *Romantic Subplot:* "Will they/Won't they" tension. MUST NOT resolve too quickly (maintain tension).
*   **Progression Rhythm (Valley Chapters):**
    *   Subplot beats should land in "Valley Chapters" to avoid clogging Plot Points: **Ch 4, 7, 9, 12, 14, 17, 19**.
    *   *Convergence:* The Subplot must resolve immediately *before* the Main Mystery resolution.
