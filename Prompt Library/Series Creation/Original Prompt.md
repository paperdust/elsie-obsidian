I need your help creating a compelling 5-book Dark Urban Spicy Romantasy series with these specific requirements: 

SERIES STRUCTURE

- A continuous storyline following the SAME core characters throughout all 5 books 
- New characters introduced organically as the series progresses 
- Each book should be at least 90,000 words 
- Written in first-person limited present tense with multiple POVs 
- Must have both an overarching series arc AND individual book arcs Character development and relationships evolve across all books (not resolved in a single volume)

GENRE INFLUENCES 

I want to blend these specific elements:

- The explicit eroticism, BDSM dynamics, and sexual intensity of Shantel Tessier's LORDS series 
- The political and dystopian themes toward witches from "Motherland: Fort Salem" 
- The complex character development and tones from Lev Grossman's "The Magicians" 
- The detailed magical world-building and supernatural hierarchy of "A Discovery of Witches" 
- The trauma elements, emotional depth, and darker tones of Lauren Biel's works 
- The epic fantasy scope, character continuity, and series progression of Sarah J. Maas's "A Court of Thorns and Roses"

WHAT I DON'T WANT

- Different main character pairings in each book 
- Standalone stories with loose connections 
- Resolved romantic arcs in a single book 
- Simple or shallow magical systems

WHAT I DO WANT

- Core characters who appear throughout all books with evolving relationships 
- Complex political and magical systems that develop across the series 
- Deep character arcs showing growth, corruption, healing, and transformation 
- Explicit content that serves character development and relationship evolution 
- A rich urban fantasy setting that expands in scope with each book 
- Morally gray characters making difficult choices 
- Multiple POVs from the same character set throughout the series

Please provide 10 comprehensive series premises that could sustain this type of continuous 5-book arc with the same characters throughout. For each premise, briefly outline the overall series arc and how it would develop across the five books while maintaining the same core cast.
