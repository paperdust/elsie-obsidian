# Core Cast

The three protagonists of The Solterra Bay Library Mysteries.

---

## Imelda Kassiani — Head Librarian

### Basic Information

| | |
|---|---|
| **Species** | Elf (Cyprian) |
| **Age** | 187 years old |
| **Appearance** | Appears elderly—equivalent to a human in her 70s |
| **Role** | Head Librarian; Cornelius's caretaker; series emotional anchor |
| **Heritage** | Cyprian elf (island-dwelling, copper-craft tradition) |

### Appearance

Imelda looks her age—and she's proud of it.

- **Face:** Weathered bronze skin with deep smile lines and crow's feet; the copper undertones of Cyprian heritage have softened to a warm patina with age
- **Hair:** Silver-white, still thick, worn in elaborate traditional braids threaded with tarnished copper beads she's had since girlhood
- **Eyes:** Warm amber, slightly faded but sharp; reading glasses on a delicate chain (enchanted, a gift from her grandmother)
- **Ears:** Pointed, prominent, usually visible—she's never hidden them
- **Build:** Small, slightly stooped now, moves more slowly than she used to but with deliberate grace
- **Hands:** Ink-stained, age-spotted, still steady enough for manuscript work; she was a skilled illuminator in her youth
- **Dress:** Flowing layers in warm colors—terracotta, saffron, olive, faded rose—clothes she's owned for decades, well-mended and comfortable

### Personality

**The Indulgent Guardian**

Imelda raised Cornelius. She was already the head librarian—had been for thirty years—when a mysterious egg appeared in the rare books room. She kept it warm. She watched it hatch. She's spent the last 127 years managing a very opinionated cat-sized dragon who believes the library belongs to him.

She finds this mostly amusing.

**Key Traits:**

- **Patient beyond measure** — 187 years will do that
- **Genuinely warm** — likes people, enjoys helping them find what they need
- **Quietly amused** — by Cornelius, by patrons, by life in general
- **Indulgent but not foolish** — she supports Cornelius's "hoard" mentality because it's good for the collection, not because she takes his dramatics seriously
- **Stubborn in her own way** — outlasted three town councils who wanted to close the library
- **Tired** — she's old, the library is struggling, and she's not sure how much fight she has left

**Her Relationship with Cornelius:**

Imelda treats Cornelius like a beloved but ridiculous pet who happens to be able to talk.

- She hatched him. Changed his bedding when he was small. Taught him to read (he was already insufferable about it).
- She *supports* his obsession with the collection—it keeps the books safe, and honestly, watching him get offended about overdue books is entertaining.
- She does *not* take his dramatic pronouncements seriously. When he declares a missing book "an outrage against the very concept of literacy," she says "Yes, dear" and goes back to her tea.
- She's proud of him, in the way you're proud of a cat who learns a trick. She'd never tell him this. He's smug enough.
- She's also the only one who remembers him as a hatchling, stumbling over his own tail, setting his nest on fire by accident. She has *perspective*.

**What She Thinks About:**

- Whether the library will survive her
- Whether she's done enough
- Whether Cornelius will be okay when she's gone (this keeps her up at night, not that she'd admit it)
- The books she's loved, the patrons she's helped, the small daily victories
- That nice satyr baker who keeps sending honey cakes

### History

**Early Life (Birth to Age 60)**
- Born on the Cyprian islands to a family of copper-smiths and poets
- Showed early aptitude for manuscript illumination
- Restless; wanted to see the world beyond the islands
- Traveled to the mainland, worked in various libraries and scriptoriums

**Finding Solterra Bay (Age 60-90)**
- Arrived in Solterra Bay planning to stay a season
- Fell in love with the Archontides collection—rare texts, strange marginalia, forgotten histories
- Became assistant librarian, then head librarian when old Master Panos died
- The library was already declining when she took over; she's been fighting that tide ever since

**The Egg (Age 60, 127 years ago)**
- Found the egg in the rare books room one morning
- No one knew where it came from (Cornelius still won't say)
- She kept it warm, talked to it, read to it
- It hatched three months later
- She named him Cornelius after a philosopher she admired; he immediately developed opinions about this

**The Long Partnership (Age 60-187)**
- Raised Cornelius from hatchling to insufferable adult
- Watched him grow into his role as library guardian
- Watched the library slowly decline despite their efforts
- Buried friends, outlived patrons, kept going
- Never married, never wanted to—the library was enough
- Now: tired, proud, worried, still showing up every morning

### Her Magic

As a Cyprian elf, Imelda has minor innate abilities:

- **Metal affinity** — can sense when her copper beads need polishing, can feel the quality of binding clasps; mostly useless for library work
- **Craft enhancement** — her manuscript repairs hold better than they should; books she's mended last longer
- **Long memory** — not magical exactly, but elven minds hold details; she remembers patrons from a century ago

She never trained formally in magic. What she has, she uses for small things.

### Relationships

**With Cornelius:**
- Mother/caretaker/amused guardian
- Supports his eccentricities; doesn't take them seriously
- Worries about him more than she shows
- The only one who can talk him down from his moods

**With Zeph:**
- Sees potential Zeph doesn't see in themselves
- Patient with teenage attitude
- Quietly hopes Zeph might be the library's future

**With Cassius:**
- Old friends; he's been next door for twenty years
- She likes his honey cakes, his steady presence, his listening
- Something more? Maybe. She's 187 and tired. Romance seems like a lot of effort.
- But she does stop by the bakery every morning.

**With the Town:**
- Respected but overlooked
- "The old elf at the library" to many
- Remembers people's grandparents, which is either endearing or unsettling

### Voice Notes

Imelda speaks like someone who has all the time in the world—because she's had a lot of it.

- Calm, measured, warm
- Occasional dry humor
- Calls Cornelius "dear" when he's being dramatic (which is always)
- Deflects his pronouncements with gentle non-engagement
- Gets sharper when something actually matters to her

**Sample dialogue:**

*Cornelius declares that a book is three days overdue and this is "a violation of the sacred compact between library and borrower":*
"Yes, dear. Would you like me to send a note, or shall we assume they've been eaten by wolves?"

*A patron asks if the library has anything on navigation:*
"We have quite a bit, actually. Sailors have been donating charts for generations—some accurate, some... aspirational. Let me show you what's reliable."

*Zeph complains that shelving is boring:*
"Most of the job is boring. And then someone comes in looking for a book that will change their life, and you get to hand it to them. The boring parts are just waiting."

### Arc Across the Series

| Book | Status | Growth |
|------|--------|--------|
| **1** | Tired, going through motions, not sure the library can be saved | Spark of hope when the first mystery proves people still care |
| **2** | Cautiously optimistic, starting to invest again | Takes on more active role in library advocacy |
| **3** | Tested—major threat to library forces her to fight | Steps up as champion when Cornelius can't do it alone |
| **4** | Confident leadership, visible transformation | Begins thinking about legacy, succession |
| **5** | Library thriving, her work vindicated | At peace; whatever comes next, she did enough |

### Key Questions to Explore

- What happens to Cornelius when Imelda dies? (She won't live forever, even by elven standards)
- Does she let herself have the romance with Cassius, or decide she's too old for that?
- What did she give up to stay at the library all these years?
- What's her relationship with the Presence in the Stacks? (She's been down there twice. She knows something.)

## Cornelius Drake — Library Dragon

### Basic Information

| | |
|---|---|
| **Species** | Library dragon |
| **Age** | 127 years old (middle-aged for a library dragon) |
| **Size** | Cat-sized (about 18 inches long, plus tail) |
| **Role** | Library guardian, reluctant detective, series POV protagonist |

### Appearance

- **Scales:** Warm bronze-gold with copper undertones, sun-faded like old book spines
- **Wings:** Fold neatly against his back; can fly but prefers not to ("undignified")
- **Eyes:** Amber with vertical pupils, highly expressive
- **Spectacles:** Small reading glasses perched on his snout (more affectation than necessity)
- **Build:** Compact, precise; moves with deliberate dignity
- **Ear-fins:** Small, sensitive; he purrs when scratched behind them (would deny this)

### Personality

**The Grumpy Guardian**

Cornelius takes overdue books as a personal insult. The library is *his* hoard, and every book that doesn't return on time is a theft from his collection. He tracks them down not because anyone asks him to—in fact, Imelda finds it mildly amusing—but because he cannot tolerate the offense.

**Key Traits:**

- **Grumpy and particular** — Easily offended by mistreatment of books
- **Territorial** — About "his" library and "his" humans (whether he admits it or not)
- **Secretly sentimental** — Especially about beloved books and longtime patrons
- **Dramatically expressive** — Sighs are his primary form of communication
- **Disdainful of modernity** — But grudgingly impressed by certain innovations
- **Pretends to be above affection** — Would torch anyone who hurt Imelda

**What He's Actually Like:**

Cornelius presents as imperious and distant, but his interior monologue reveals warmth he'd never express aloud. He remembers every borrower who ever treated a book with care. He keeps a mental list of patrons who are "acceptable." He worries about Imelda more than he'd ever admit.

He has spent 127 years watching people come and go, watching the library slowly fade, and he's begun to believe there's nothing he can do about it. The series is about discovering he's wrong.

### His Relationship with Imelda

Imelda hatched him. She kept his egg warm, watched him emerge, raised him from a hatchling who stumbled over his own tail and accidentally set his nest on fire.

He has never known a world without her.

**The dynamic:**
- She treats him like a beloved but ridiculous cat who happens to talk
- She *supports* his hoard mentality because it's good for the collection
- She *doesn't* take his dramatics seriously
- When he declares something "an outrage against literacy," she says "Yes, dear" and returns to her tea
- He would never admit how much he depends on her
- He worries about what happens when she's gone (she's 187 and mortal-ish)
- She worries about what happens to him when she's gone (and hides this worry)

**She remembers:**
- The hatchling who couldn't control his fire
- The young dragon who cried when a book was damaged
- Every stage of his growth into who he is now

**He pretends to forget:**
- All of the above
- That he still needs her

### His Relationship with Zeph

Mutual exasperation—at first.

**Cornelius's view:**
- Zeph is emblematic of "young people these days"
- They don't appreciate books, don't respect libraries, don't understand what they have
- Their clothes are inappropriate, their attention span is inadequate, their attitude is intolerable
- And yet... they're clever. When they bother to engage.
- He will not admit he sees potential. That would be encouragement.

**The arc:**
- Book 1: Mutual exasperation
- Book 3: Grudging respect
- Book 5: Genuine affection (still expressed through grumbling)

### Voice Notes

Cornelius is the first-person POV narrator. His voice should be:

- **Formal and slightly antiquated** — Not archaic, but precise
- **Dry wit and cutting observations** — He notices everything and judges most of it
- **Interior warmth hidden beneath exterior grumpiness** — The reader sees what he won't say aloud
- **Dragon-specific sensory details** — He smells emotions, sees heat signatures, senses when books are in distress

**Sample voice:**

> The young human arrived precisely when I expected: late. They slouched through the door with the boneless posture of adolescence, surveyed the library's reading room with an expression of profound suffering, and sighed.
>
> The sigh was unnecessary. I had already sighed. There was no need for two sighs in one room.
>
> "You must be the dragon," they said.
>
> "And you must be the intern." I did not rise from my perch. "Imelda has explained your duties?"
>
> "Shelving. Cataloging. Not touching the old books. Not bothering you." They recited this with the enthusiasm of someone reading a execution warrant.
>
> "Correct on all counts. I see you are capable of listening. How refreshing."
>
> They looked at me. I looked at them. The afternoon sun fell through the high windows, illuminating dust motes and the profound mutual skepticism between us.
>
> It was going to be a very long internship.

### What He Eats

**The irony:** Cornelius is our window into Solterra Bay's mouthwatering food culture—and he has no interest in any of it.

**His actual diet:**
- **Fresh herbs** — Grazes directly from the garden; the mint bed is his
- **Mint** — His favorite; always has some nearby; eats entire sprigs
- **Small raw fish** — Fresh, clean, presented properly
- **Insects** — Crickets, beetles; prefers them live
- **Eggs** — Raw, punctured, contents slurped delicately
- **Honey** — Sparingly; the dark local honey only

**What he won't touch:**
- Bread, pastry, anything grain-based ("Flour paste. I am not a pigeon.")
- Cooked fish ("Ruined.")
- Cheese ("I have watched it being made. I will never recover.")
- Legumes ("My digestion is not a matter for public discussion.")
- Anything from a communal pot ("I do not know where those ladles have been.")

**The narrative function:**

Cornelius describes food beautifully—he's observant and precise—but his descriptions are anthropological, not appetitive. He notices what humans eat the way a scholar notes cultural practices. The contrast between how appetizing the food sounds and how unimpressed he is creates gentle humor.

### His Magic

Library dragons have minor, book-adjacent abilities:

- **Enhanced senses** — Can smell lies, track by scent, see heat signatures
- **Book-sense** — Knows when books in his care are damaged, stolen, or in distress
- **Fire breath** — Tiny and precise; for candles, wax seals, and dramatic emphasis—never violence
- **Long memory** — Remembers every book and every borrower
- **Languages** — Speaks Common plus several dead languages

### Arc Across Series

| Book | Status | Growth |
|------|--------|--------|
| **1** | Set in his ways, resistant to change, sees library's decline as inevitable | First mystery proves his methods work; spark of hope |
| **2** | Cautiously engaged, still skeptical | Starts to believe change might be possible |
| **3** | Forced to confront that he's been passively watching the library fade | Steps up when the library is threatened |
| **4** | Actively invested in the library's future | Relationships deepen; allows himself to care |
| **5** | Building community, has found his people | The library thrives; he's no longer alone |

### Key Questions to Explore

- What does Cornelius actually remember about where he came from? (He won't say.)
- What happens when Imelda dies? (This is his deepest fear.)
- Can he learn to trust new people, or only the ones who've already proven themselves?
- What is the Presence in the Stacks, and why won't he discuss it?

## Zephyr "Zeph" Taraki — The Intern

### Basic Information

| | |
|---|---|
| **Species** | Human, possibly Lamassu-touched (Anatolian heritage) |
| **Age** | 16 in Book 1; ages across series |
| **Pronouns** | They/them |
| **Role** | Mandatory intern, Cornelius's foil, bridge to younger generation |

### Appearance

- **Skin:** Medium brown, warm undertones
- **Hair:** Thick and dark with an odd bronze sheen in sunlight (possible Lamassu heritage)
- **Eyes:** Expressive dark eyes, perpetually skeptical eyebrows
- **Build:** Lanky, still growing into their limbs
- **Style:** Whatever's current teen fashion (to Cornelius's eternal disapproval)
- **Notable:** Faint wing-marks on shoulder blades? (If Lamassu-touched—to be confirmed)

### Personality

**The Reluctant Recruit**

Zeph is here because they have to be. School requires community service. The library was the only option that didn't involve manual labor in the sun. They are counting the days until their internship ends.

Or they were. Before the mysteries started.

**Key Traits:**

- **Sarcastic** — Default defense mechanism
- **Bored** — Or affecting boredom; hard to tell
- **Secretly clever** — Sharp mind hidden behind disinterest
- **Perceptive** — Notices things others miss (possibly enhanced by Lamassu heritage?)
- **Secretly enjoys feeling useful** — Would never admit it
- **Thinks libraries are dusty relics** — At first

**What They're Actually Like:**

Zeph represents the generation that's forgotten the library exists. To them, it's a building old people go to, full of old books no one reads. The dragon is weird. The head librarian is nice but ancient. Nothing interesting happens here.

And then something interesting happens. And Zeph discovers they're good at this—at noticing, at questioning, at finding things out. They discover that books matter, that the library matters, that *they* might matter.

They're never going to say any of this out loud.

### The Lamassu Heritage (Possible)

Zeph's Anatolian family may carry Lamassu blood—descendant of the winged guardian spirits.

**If present, manifests as:**
- Faint wing-marks on shoulder blades (birthmark-like)
- The bronze sheen in their hair
- Enhanced intuition (not mind-reading; just good instincts)
- Protective instincts that surprise them
- Occasional prophetic dreams (unreliable)

**Narrative potential:**
- Cornelius might recognize the signs before Zeph does
- Their intuition could help with mysteries
- The heritage connects them to guardian traditions—including library guardians
- It might explain why they were "randomly" assigned to the library internship

### Their Relationship with Cornelius

**Zeph's view:**
- Cornelius is a bossy, outdated lizard
- He's fussy about books no one cares about
- He treats them like an inconvenience (which, fair)
- But... he's also kind of impressive?
- And he takes things seriously in a way that's almost admirable?
- Not that Zeph would ever say that.

**The arc:**
- Book 1: "This dragon is insufferable and I'm counting the days."
- Book 2: "Okay, the mystery stuff is kind of interesting."
- Book 3: "If anyone hurts this library, I will personally make them regret it."
- Book 5: "I might want to do this forever. Don't tell anyone I said that."

### Their Relationship with Imelda

Imelda sees Zeph's potential before they do.

**The dynamic:**
- Imelda is patient with teenage attitude (she's been doing this for over a century)
- She gives Zeph meaningful work without making a big deal of it
- She doesn't push; she just creates opportunities
- Zeph slowly realizes Imelda is *cool*, actually—in a quiet way
- The mentor relationship develops across the series

### Voice Notes

Zeph's voice (in dialogue and internal observations from Cornelius's POV) should be:

- **Contemporary but not dated** — Teen voice without specific slang that will age poorly
- **Sarcastic surface, genuine underneath** — Defense mechanisms visible
- **Smart but hiding it** — Doesn't want to seem like they care
- **Evolving** — Gets more engaged as series progresses

**Sample dialogue:**

> "So let me understand this," Zeph said, not looking up from the shelf they were theoretically organizing. "Someone borrowed a book. Didn't return it. This is a *crisis*?"
>
> "The book is three weeks overdue," I said. "It is a first edition. It is irreplaceable."
>
> "Can't you just... send a note? 'Dear borrower, please return the book, regards, the tiny angry dragon'?"
>
> "I am not *tiny*. I am appropriately sized for my species." I adjusted my spectacles. "And I have sent notes. Three of them. The borrower has not responded."
>
> Zeph finally looked at me. "So what are you going to do? Breathe fire at them?"
>
> "Don't be absurd. I am going to find out *why* they haven't returned it." I fixed them with what I hoped was an imperious stare. "And you are going to help."
>
> "I am?"
>
> "You are young. You move in social circles I do not. You can go places without attracting attention."
>
> "You want me to *spy* on someone? For a *library book*?"
>
> I considered this framing. "Yes."
>
> Zeph stared at me for a long moment. Then, very slightly, the corner of their mouth twitched.
>
> "Okay," they said. "That's actually kind of cool."

### Arc Across Series

| Book | Age | Status | Growth |
|------|-----|--------|--------|
| **1** | 16 | Mandatory intern, counting the days | Discovers mysteries are interesting; first real engagement |
| **2** | 17 | Returning (voluntarily?), grudgingly invested | Admits the library "isn't that bad"; brings a friend once |
| **3** | 17-18 | Actively helps defend the library | Takes ownership; "this is *my* library too" (said in anger, meant) |
| **4** | 18 | Unofficial assistant, real responsibility | Deepening relationships; considers the future |
| **5** | 19 | Young adult, key to youth programs | Considering librarianship as a career; the torch passes |

### Potential Connections

- **Sophia Doukas** (19) — Similar age, creative, underestimated by elders; potential friend
- **Kosta Pelagios** (19) — Nereid-touched crew member on Mago's boat; potential age-appropriate romance in Books 3-4
- **Lyra Theron** — The sphinx-kin schoolteacher who assigned them here; knows more than she's saying?

### Key Questions to Explore

- Is the Lamassu heritage real, and what does it mean for them?
- Were they "randomly" assigned to the library, or was there a reason?
- What do they want to do with their life? (They don't know yet—part of the arc)
- How do they feel about potentially outliving Imelda and becoming Cornelius's... person?

## The Trio Dynamic

### The Found Family Arc

The series is about three people becoming a family:

- **Imelda** — The mother/grandmother figure who has been here longest
- **Cornelius** — The difficult "middle child" who needs family but won't admit it
- **Zeph** — The newcomer who doesn't know yet that they've found their people

### Relationship Map

```

CORNELIUS <---> ZEPH
         mutual
       exasperation
        → respect
        → affection
```

### Key Dynamics

**Imelda + Cornelius (40+ years):**
- She hatched him, raised him, knows all his moods
- She indulges him without taking him seriously
- He depends on her more than he admits
- She worries about him more than she shows
- They communicate in shorthand developed over decades

**Imelda + Zeph (developing):**
- She sees who they could become
- She gives them space to discover it themselves
- Patient mentorship without pressure
- Zeph slowly realizes she's someone worth learning from

**Cornelius + Zeph (developing):**
- Mutual exasperation at first
- He thinks they're emblematic of declining standards
- They think he's a fussy, outdated lizard
- Grudging respect grows as they work together
- Eventually: genuine affection expressed through continued grumbling

### The Trio Together

When all three are in a scene:

- Imelda mediates between the other two
- Cornelius complains; Zeph rolls their eyes; Imelda says "Yes, dear"
- Zeph and Cornelius agree on something; both immediately deny it
- The warmth is visible to readers even when characters won't name it

### Series Emotional Arc

| Book | Trio Status |
|------|-------------|
| **1** | Strangers forced together; Imelda as bridge |
| **2** | Functional team; still prickly |
| **3** | Tested by crisis; discover they'll fight for each other |
| **4** | Genuine family; comfortable with the discomfort |
| **5** | Established unit; preparing for the future |

### The Unspoken Question

Imelda is 187. Elves live long, but not forever. Cornelius is 127. Library dragons can live much longer.

Someday, it will be Cornelius and Zeph. Someday, it might just be Cornelius.

No one talks about this. Everyone thinks about it.
