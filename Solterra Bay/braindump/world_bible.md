# PART I: THE CORE CAST

This section details the primary protagonists and their immediate circle. These characters drive the narrative voice and emotional arc of the series.

## Cornelius Drake
**Role:** POV Protagonist / The Library Dragon  
**Species:** Library Dragon (*Draco bibliotheca*)  
**Age:** 127 (Adult, but not ancient)  
**Size:** Large house cat (approx. 12-14 lbs). Wingspan approx. 3 feet.  
**Appearance:** Scales of burnished bronze with copper undertones (matching the library's oldest bindings). Eyes like liquid gold behind custom spectacles.

### Character Concept
"Sherlock Holmes if he were a cat-sized dragon who hoarded books instead of cocaine."  
Cornelius is haughty, fastidious, and deeply protective of his hoard (the library). He views humans as "curiously inefficient" but is secretly fascinated by them. He pretends to care only about book preservation, but his actions consistently show he cares about his *librarians*.

### Draconic Physiology & Magic
Cornelius is not a combat dragon. His biology is evolved for the library environment:
*   **Omniglot Reading:** Can instantly read and understand any written language, cipher, or code. Includes forensic analysis of handwriting, ink, and paper age.
*   **Total Recall:** Has perfect eidetic memory for anything he has read or the physical location of any book in his hoard.
*   **Breath Weapon:** A tiny, pencil-thin jet of blue flame. Used for sealing wax, lighting candles, or soldering. Not a weapon of war (though he threatens singed eyebrows often).

### Diet & Quirks
Cornelius is an obligate carnivore/insectivore with specific tastes.
*   **Loves:** Fresh mint (obsessively chews it), live crickets ("satisfying crunch"), raw fish ("sushi style"), raw eggs (punctured and slurped).
*   **Hates:** Cooked food ("ruined"), bread ("flour paste"), cheese ("spoiled milk").
*   **The Irony:** He describes human food with poetic, anthropological beauty (narratively) while remaining personally disgusted by it.

### Voice Notes
*   **Tone:** Precise, slightly antiquated, melodramatic but dignified. Never uses contractions in internal monologue (often does in dialogue for speed).
*   **Sample:** *"The young human arrived precisely when I expected: late. He brought with him the damp brow of anxiety and... crumbs of cheese upon his tunic. Why must humans always be so messy?"*

---

## Imelda Kassiani
**Role:** Head Librarian / The Anchor  
**Species:** Cyprian Elf  
**Age:** 187 (Appears late 60s/70s in human terms)  
**Appearance:** Silver-white hair worn in intricate braids woven with copper beads. Nut-brown skin heavily lined (elves age eventually). Hands stained with ink and metal dust.

### Character Concept
"The eye of the storm."  
Imelda hatched Cornelius. She is the only person who can order him around, usually by indulging his drama until he tires of it. She is calm, unshakeable, and deeply respected by the town. She represents the "Cozy" aspect of the series—tea, mending, patience.

### Magic & Skills
*   **Metal Affinity:** Like most Cyprian elves, she senses metal purity and weakness. She uses this to repair book clasps, heating systems, and ancient mechanisms.
*   **Mending:** Can fix torn pages and broken spines with a touch, provided the damage isn't catastrophic.
*   **The Long View:** She remembers the great-grandparents of the current town council. This gives her immense political soft power.

### Relationship to Cornelius
Mother/Son dynamic disguised as Owner/Cat. She knows exactly which spot behind his ears to scratch. She plants extra mint for him. He pretends to tolerate her; she knows he would burn the world for her.

### Voice Notes
*   **Tone:** Warm, measured, amused. The voice of someone who has seen everything before.
*   **Keywords:** "Yes, dear," "Of course, Cornelius," "Shall we assume they were eaten by wolves?"
*   **Sample:** *"Cornelius, get off the invite list. Unless you plan to write the invitations yourself, in which case, please check your spelling of 'Mayor'."*

---

## Zephyr "Zeph" Taraki
**Role:** The Intern / The Legs / The Foil  
**Species:** Human (with Lamassu ancestry)  
**Age:** 16  
**Appearance:** Lanky, awkward growth phase. Dark skin, unruly black hair that gleams with an unnatural bronze sheen in sunlight.

### Character Concept
"The reluctant hero."  
Zeph is doing this internship for school credit and hates that he actually likes it. He is the reader surrogate for asking "Wait, why?" He provides the physical dexterity Cornelius lacks (opening heavy doors, reaching high shelves without flying).

### Heritage Clues (The Mystery Arc)
Zeph is **Lamassu-touched** (descended from ancient Assyrian guardian spirits), though he doesn't know it yet.
*   **The Bronze Sheen:** His hair looks metallic in the sun.
*   **Guardian Sense:** He gets a "buzzing" headache when the library is threatened.
*   **Intuition:** He creates order from chaos instinctively.

### Relationship to Cornelius
Antagonistic mentor/student. Cornelius calls him "The Intern" or "Boy." Zeph calls him "Boss" (sarcabilly).
**Arc:** begins with mutual annoyance, evolves into "Nobody insults the lizard but me."

### Voice Notes
*   **Tone:** Sarcastic, brief, defensive (teenager). Hides intelligence behind feigned boredom.
*   **Keywords:** "Whatever," "Do I have to?", "Cool, I guess."
*   **Sample:** *"You want me to climb into the vent? You realize I don't have wings, right? Or insurance?"*

---

## Captain Theodoros "Theo" Melas
**Role:** Captain of the Town Watch / The Obstacle  
**Species:** Human  
**Age:** 44  
**Appearance:** Weathered, tired eyes, permanent stubble (shaves at night, regrows by noon). Uniform is clean but worn.

### Character Concept
"The exhausted professional."  
Theo is a good man in a hard job with no budget. He wants to solve crimes, but he has to deal with drunken sailors, feuding tile families, and a dragon who thinks he's a detective.

### Relationship to Cornelius
Frenemies. Theo thinks Cornelius is a nuisance interfering in police work. Cornelius thinks Theo is "painfully linear" in his thinking. They bond over a shared desire for order.

### Voice Notes
*   **Tone:** Dry, direct, weary. No flowery language.
*   **Sample:** *"Dragon, if you set fire to my crime scene, I will arrest you. I don't care that you don't have pockets fitting for handcuffs."*

# PART II: THE TOWN & ITS PEOPLE

Solterra Bay is a character in itself—a vertical town of heated stone, winding stairs, and gossip. This section connects the key recurring characters to the locations where they are found.

## 1. The Library (The Hub)
**Building:** A repurposed merchant villa from the Golden Age. Faded pink plaster, honey-colored columns.
**Atmosphere:** A sanctuary. Cool when the outside is hot. Smells of old paper, vanilla, dust, and mint.

### Key Spaces
*   **The Courtyard:** Overgrown in a "pleasingly forgotten" way. Features sun-warmed benches and a massive mint patch (cornelius's snack).
*   **The Sunny Corner:** The best reading light in the main atrium. This is **Yiayia Despina's** territory.
*   **The Stacks Below:** The basement archives. Proper temperature control, but slightly ominous. Shadows cling here.
*   **The Roof:** Flat, terracotta-tiled. Used for drying herbs or evening star-gazing.

### Library Regulars
*   **Yiayia Despina Kostopoulos (The Elder):** 83. Human. Small, weathered, wears black. She "owns" a specific chair. Brings cookies (koulourakia) to "bribe" the staff. She knows the town's history because she *lived* it.
*   **Brother Demos (The Eager Borrower):** 28. Half-Elf. Junior healer. Always borrowing books on obscure tropical diseases he will never treat. Enthusiastic, disorganized.

### The Team
*   **Cassius Nerva (The Baker):** 48. **Satyr-kin** (Human torso, goat legs, small horns). Warm, steady, a listener. He knows everyone's secrets because they confess while waiting for bread.
    *   *Cornelius Opinion:* "He is covered in flour. But his mint tea is acceptable."

### The Staff & Regulars

*   **Yannis (The Cook):** Human. Despina's husband. Silent genius of the stew pot.
*   **Captain Mago Hanno:** 52. **Orc**. Fishing fleet leader. Gruff exterior, but Zeph has caught him checking out romance novels from the library.

---

## 4. The Bathhouse (The Equalizer)
**Location:** Mid-town, fed by the thermal aqueduct.
**Architecture:** A showroom for the Tile Families. Every surface is an intricate mosaic.
**Role:** Business deals happen naked. Vulnerability = Truth.

**Sensory:** Whitewashed stone, blindingly bright. Smells of lavender, medicinal spirits, and silence.
**Role:** The hospital / clinic.

### Staff
*   **Sister Photine (Head Healer):** 52. Human. Practical, brisk, kind. One of the few people Cornelius respects because she returns medical texts *on time*.

---

## 6. The Docks (The Border)
**Vibe:** Chaos. Foreign languages, crates, fish guts, shouting.
**Sensory:** The smell is overwhelming—brine, rot, tar, spices.
**Cornelius Opinion:** "A necessary evil for the acquisition of fresh fish. Otherwise, a sensory nightmare."

### Notable Figures
*   **Harbor Master Theron:** Human. Missing two fingers. Corrupt enough to be convenient, honest enough to stay employed.
*   **Nephele (Fishmonger):** **Nereid-touched**. Scales on her arms. Booming voice. sells the best catch.

---

## 7. The Main Square (The Stage)
**Features:** The Town Hall (Loggia), The Fountain (Mosaic by House Doukas), The Weekly Market.

*   **Mayor Tanit Barca:** Orc. See *Core Cast* notes—she rules from the Loggia here.

---

## 8. The Washhouse (The Network)
**Location:** Natural spring source on the upper tier.
**Role:** Laundry and Information. The washer-women see the stained sheets, the torn clothes, the evidence of everyone's private lives.
**Key Figure:** **Stavroula** (Naiad-touched). The unofficial matriarch of the wash. If you need to know who is sleeping with whom, ask her.

### Notable Regular
*   **Markos Veneti:** 28. Heir to House Veneti. Does his own laundry (scandalous!) because it's the only place he can meet **Dimitra Kallistos** without their families knowing.

---

## 9. The Widow's Perch (The Soul)
**Location:** A high, rocky promontory overlooking the open sea.
**Role:** A place for grieving, thinking, or watching for ships that never came back.
**Vibe:** Windy, silent, lonely. The only place in town without noise.
**Cornelius Usage:** He claims he goes there for the "excellent thermal updrafts" for flying. Actually, he goes there when he misses his previous librarians.

---

# PART III: DAILY LIFE & CULTURE

Life in Solterra Bay moves at the pace of the sun. The sensory experience of the town is defined by what is being cooked, who is being healed, and what rules bind them.

## 1. Food & The Rhythm of Meals
Cuisine here is "Scarcity turned to Art"—simple ingredients (fish, lemon, oil, chickpeas) treated with obsessive care.

### Signature Dishes (The Solterra Menu)
1.  **Psari sta Karvouna (Harbor-Fire Fish):**
    *   *The Dish:* Whole fish (daily catch), gutted and stuffed with lemon/garlic/wild herbs.
    *   *The Ritual:* Grilled over communal driftwood fires at the harbor every evening. Families eat on the dazzlingly warm sea-wall stones.
    *   *Cornelius:* "Acceptable. The smoke is pleasant."
2.  **Revithada (The Slow Pot):**
    *   *The Dish:* Chickpeas, olive oil, onions, bay leaves. Zero meat.
    *   *The Ritual:* Clay pots are brought to **Cassius’s Bakery** in the morning to slow-cook in the cooling ovens all day. The worker's lunch.
    *   *Cornelius:* "I do not eat legumes. But the smell is not unpleasant."
3.  **Tyropita (Grandmother’s Pie):**
    *   *The Dish:* Shatteringly crisp phyllo pastry layered with goat cheese and herbs.
    *   *The Ritual:* Celebration food. Yiayia Despina brings one to the library weekly.
4.  **Glyka Koutaliou (Spoon Sweets):**
    *   *The Dish:* Fruit (fig, cherry, quince) preserved in intense syrup.
    *   *The Ritual:* Hospitality mandatory. Guests are served one teaspoon of sweet and a glass of cold water.
    *   *Cornelius:* "A civilized custom." (He loves the fig ones).
5.  **Kakavia (Fisherman’s Soup):**
    *   *The Dish:* The "unsellable" catch boiled into a rich, briny broth with lemon.
    *   *The Ritual:* Eaten at **The Oar & Anchor** on rough nights.

### Cornelius’s Private Diet
While he narrates human food poetically, his own diet is... specific.
*   **Mint:** He consumes bushels of fresh mint. It aids his fire-breath chemistry.
*   **Insects:** Live crickets are a favorite snack.
*   **Raw:** He will eat raw fish or eggs (shell and all).
*   **Disdain:** He views bread as "flour paste" and cooking as "ruining perfectly good protein."

## 2. Magic & Healing Rules
Magic in Solterra Bay is "Cozy"—it alleviates suffering but does not remove mortality.

### The Temple of Althaia (Healing)
Healing magic is warm, antiseptic, and tiring. Energy comes from the patient’s own reserves, accelerated by the healer.
*   **CAN:**
    *   **Set Bones:** A broken leg heals in days, not weeks.
    *   **Purify Infection:** Sepsis is unknown here. Cuts never fester.
    *   **Manage Pain:** Dental work and surgery are painless (magical nerve blocks).
    *   **Ease Burns:** Skin restored without scarring if treated immediately.
*   **CANNOT:**
    *   **Resurrect:** Death is final.
    *   **Instant Cure:** You still need bed rest. You cannot "potion" your way to full health in combat.
    *   **Regrow Limbs:** A severed finger stays severed (though the stump heals cleanly).
    *   **Cure Old Age:** People die of natural causes.

### Domestic & Hedge Magic
*   **Cold-Boxes:** Ice-boxes kept cold by minor runes (common).
*   **Pest Wards:** Chalk marks to keep ants out of sugar (common).
*   **Mending:** Imelda can fuse a broken ceramic pot or book spine as good as new.
*   *Note on Combat:* There are no fireballs or lightning bolts. Violence is physical (swords/fists); magic is domestic.

---

## 3. Technology Level
*   **Era:** Antiquity / Early Medieval mix.
*   **Communications:** Written letters carried by **Centaur Couriers** (inland) or Ships.
*   **Lighting:** Oil lamps (olive oil) and beeswax candles. No gas or electricity.
*   **Water:** Advanced aqueducts and cisterns. The sound of running water is a sign of wealth/civic pride.
*   **Sanitation:** Bathhouses are social hubs. Private plumbing is for the rich.

# PART IV: HISTORY & POWERS

The history of Solterra Bay is written in ceramic. The town's economy, politics, and social structure are defined by the Three Families and the diverse species that inhabit the coast.

## 1. The Three Tile Families
Solterra Bay is famous for its ceramic tiles. The industry is dominated by three rival houses, whose feuds drive much of the town's local politics.

### House Kallistos (The Old Masters)
*   **Sigil:** The Spiral Sun (Gold on White).
*   **Philosophy:** "Tradition is Perfection." They use the same clay pits and kiln designs their ancestors used 400 years ago. Their tiles are heavy, durable, and expensive.
*   **The Vibe:** Old Money, Snobbish, Architectural.
*   **Key Members:**
    *   **Master Stavros (71):** Patriarch. Refuses to retire. Hates innovation.
    *   **Dimitra (34):** Heir. A **Gorgon** (from her mother’s side). She is brilliant but stifled by her grandfather. She conducts secret research in the library on ancient glazing techniques.
    *   **Petros (45):** The Black Sheep. Runs a small, experimental workshop the family pretends doesn't exist.

### House Doukas (The Innovators)
*   **Sigil:** The Leaping Fish (Azure on Cream).
*   **Philosophy:** "Beauty is Fluid." Focused on intricate murals, new colors, and artistic expression.
*   **The Feud:** House Doukas was founded by a Kallistos apprentice 80 years ago who stole a secret glaze recipe (allegedly). Kallistos members will not speak to Doukas members in public.
*   **Key Members:**
    *   **Master Eleni (63):** Matriarch. A genius artist but a terrible businesswoman. She is always covered in paint.
    *   **Nikolas (40):** The Manager. Eleni's son. He is secretly exhausted trying to keep the business profitable while his mother paints.
    *   **Sophia (19):** The Prodigy. Already producing work that rivals the masters.
    *   **Alexandros (58):** The Salesman. Charming, buys drinks for everyone, promises delivery dates they can't meet.

### House Veneti (The Merchants)
*   **Sigil:** The Anchor (Black on Terracotta).
*   **Philosophy:** "Tiles for the World." Focused on export, volume, and consistency. They have the biggest ships.
*   **The Vibe:** Commercial, Efficient, "New Money."
*   **Key Members:**
    *   **Master Kostas (55):** A businessman first, potter second. Loves contracts.
    *   **Thalia (52):** His wife. A **Cyprian Elf**. She is the actual artistic talent ensuring quality, though Kostas takes the credit.
    *   **Markos (28):** Heir. He hates the business side and secretly loves the craft. **Secret:** He is in a forbidden romance with **Dimitra Kallistos**.

## 2. Species & Demographics
Solterra Bay is a crossroads. The population is diverse, with species integrated into daily life.
*   **Humans:** ~40%
*   **Mythological Kin:** ~35%
*   **Elves:** ~12%
*   **Orcs:** ~10%
*   **Dwarves:** ~3%

### Mythological Kin (The 35%)
These are species with divine or magical ancestry who are distinct populations.
*   **Sirens:**
    *   *Traits:* Iridescent skin, gills at the neck, webbed fingers.
    *   *Role:* Fishermen and sailors.
    *   *The Magic:* **The Voice.** They can sing emotions. They do *not* use mind control (that’s illegal and rude). They sing courage into storms or calm into brawls.
*   **Gorgons:**
    *   *Traits:* Living snakes for hair (usually calm/sleeping), patches of scales on skin.
    *   *Role:* Stonemasons and architects.
    *   *The Magic:* **Petrifying Gaze.** They cannot turn people to stone permanently (that’s a myth). They can induce **Paralysis/Stun** by making eye contact. It’s a defense mechanism, not a weapon. They wear veils or dark glasses when stressed.
*   **Satyr-kin:**
    *   *Traits:* Goat legs, horns, fuzzy ears.
    *   *Role:* Bakers, musicians, herdsmen.
    *   *Stereotype:* Drunken party animals.
    *   *Reality:* They prioritize joy and community. Excellent cooks.
*   **Sphinx-kin:**
    *   *Traits:* Lion lower body, wings (often vestigial/small), human torso.
    *   *Role:* Scholars and teachers.
    *   *The Magic:* **Truth-Sense.** They are allergic to lies (it makes them sneeze). They love riddles.
*   **Nymph-touched:**
    *   Humans with elemental ancestry.
    *   *Naiads:* Fresh water. Blue tint. Bathhouse workers.
    *   *Nereids:* Salt water. Iridescent. Pearl divers.
    *   *Oreads:* Mountains/Stone. Grey tint. Miners.
    *   *Dryads:* Plants/Trees. Bark patches. Gardeners.

### The Elves
*   **Cyprian Elves (Local):** Bronze skin, dark hair. Affinity for **Copper and Bronze**. They are smiths and jewelers. (Imelda is Cyprian).
*   **Etruscan Elves:** Pale/Grey skin. Affinity for **Divination and Shadows**. Antiquarians.
*   **Iberian Elves:** River-folk. Traders.

### The Orcs (Phoenic Heritage)
Solterra Bay orcs descend from a seafaring, mercantile culture (coded Phoenician/Carthaginian).
*   **Traits:** Green/Grey/Brown skin. Tusks (often capped with gold or brass).
*   **Culture:** Deeply family-oriented. Obsessed with contracts and honor. "An Orc's handshake is worth more than gold."
*   **Role:** The backbone of the merchant fleet and town administration. (Mayor Barca is an Orc).

### Library Dragons (*Draco bibliotheca*)
*   **Ecological Niche:** They are not born; they occur. When a collection of books enters a state of "Critical Knowledge Mass," a dragon egg may appear.
*   **Bonding:** They bond to the **Library** first, and the **Librarian** second.
*   **Life Cycle:** They grow as the collection grows. Cornelius is "Cat Sized" because his library is a provincial town library. The Dragon of the Great Library in the capital is the size of a bus.

---

## 3. A Note on Mystery Logic
In Solterra Bay, the "Whodunit" often hinges on these physiological traits:
1.  **Forensics:** Document analysis (handwriting, ink, paper integrity) is Cornelius's primary method. A dragon's eye for detail is superior to human sight.
2.  **Magic:** Magic leaves a trace. Imelda can "read" if a lock was opened physically or magically.
3.  **Abilities:** A locked room mystery changes when the suspect is a Siren (can hold breath underwater to escape via cistern) or a Satyr (can jump 10 feet vertical). *The mystery solution must always play fair with these established species rules.*
