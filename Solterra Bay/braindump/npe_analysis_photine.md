# NPE Analysis: The Physics of Photine's Choice

This document updates the force analysis for Sister Photine based on the "Tragic Friend" revelation.

## 1. The Critical Vector Collision
The murder occurs because two positive vectors collide in a way that creates a **Zero-Sum Kinetic Event**.

*   **Demos's Vector:** `V_Protect(Photine)` -> **Strength +9**
    *   *Action:* Stop the treatment. Intervene. Report her condition to the Council to force medical leave.
    *   *Goal:* Save Photine from suicide-by-magic.

*   **Photine's Vector:** `V_Protect(Melaina)` -> **Strength +10 (Absolute)**
    *   *Action:* Maintain the Bio-Link at all costs.
    *   *Goal:* Keep Melaina alive for one more day.

## 2. The Calculation (Why She Did It)
Why did she attack her friend? Because of the **Time Horizon (Temporal Axis)**.

*   **Demos's Logic (Long-Term):** "If I stop her now, she lives for 40 more years. If I don't, she dies in a month."
*   **Photine's Logic (Immediate):** "If he stops me *now*, Melaina dies *tonight*. The link breaks. The Weep takes her."

**The NPE Equation:**
$$ \text{Cost(Photine's Life)} < \text{Cost(Melaina's Life)} $$

She views her own life as **expendable currency**. Demos trying to "save" that currency is, to her, an act of sabotage. He is trying to save a wallet while she is trying to buy a life.

## 3. The Impulse (The Threshold)
The petrification was a **Reflex Action**, not a premeditated murder.

*   **Trigger:** Demos reaching for the door (or her).
*   **Field Pressure:** High Adrenaline (Panic).
*   **Vector Override:** `V_Panic` spikes to +10, temporarily suppressing `V_Ethics` and `V_Friendship`.
*   **The Tool:** The Petrification Spell was *in her hand* (perhaps she was researching it as a last-ditch cure for the Weep?). She used what she held.

**Result:** A "Stasis" response. She didn't want him dead; she wanted him *stopped*. She wanted to hit "Pause" on the conversation so she could finish the treatment. The tragedy is that "Pause" became "Stop."
