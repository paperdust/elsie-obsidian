# Architecture and Buildings in Solterra Bay

## The Solterra Bay Palette

### Beyond White and Blue

Solterra Bay's architecture draws from the full Mediterranean tradition—not the Cycladic white-and-blue cliché, but the richer, warmer palette of mainland Greek, Southern Italian, and Anatolian influences.

### Building Materials

**Stone:**
- Local limestone ranging from warm honey to pale grey
- Darker volcanic stone for foundations and sea walls
- Stone left exposed on older buildings; plastered on newer ones
- The oldest structures show centuries of patching and repair

**Plaster and Wash:**
- Faded ochre, warm cream, weathered pink, pale terracotta
- Whitewash reserved for temples and public buildings (signals importance)
- Plaster colors faded and patchy—signs of age, not poverty
- Each generation adds their layer; walls tell history

**Roofs:**
- Terracotta tiles in various states of repair
- Older buildings have darker, lichen-covered tiles
- Some flat roofs (used for drying fish, sleeping in summer, storage)
- Replacement tiles never quite match the originals

**Wood:**
- Scarce and valued (mountains are scrubby, not forested)
- Used for shutters, doors, balcony rails, roof beams
- Weathered grey-brown from sun and salt
- Wealthy homes have more woodwork; poor homes have minimal

**Accents:**
- Ironwork for balconies, hinges, gates—practical, not ornate
- Ceramic tiles on fountains, thresholds, niches (see: Tile Families document)
- Painted doors—the one place for bright color, each family's choice

### The Visual Result

> Warm stone, the color of old honey where the sun hit it, grey in the shadows. Plaster in shades of faded sunset—ochre bleeding into cream, a wall that might once have been pink. Terracotta roofs at different angles, some tiles cracked and replaced with ones that didn't quite match, some green with age. Shutters bleached grey by decades of salt wind, or painted colors that had softened: a door that was once bright blue now the shade of a winter sea, another in what might have been red, now closer to rust.
>
> The streets smelled of stone dust and cooking and the sea.

## Town Layout and Terrain

### The Shape of Solterra Bay

**The Bay:**
- Natural harbor formed by mountains curving around
- Protected from open sea storms
- Deep enough for trading vessels, shallow edges for fishing boats

**The Terrain:**

| Zone | Character |
|------|-----------|
| **The Harbor Front** | Flat, busy, commercial—warehouses, fish markets, taverns, communal fire pits |
| **The Lower Town** | Gentle slope, densest building—shops, homes, main square, Cassius's bakery |
| **The Middle Town** | Steeper, residential—winding streets, stairs, the library |
| **The Upper Town** | Steepest, oldest—the original settlement, narrow lanes, temples, oldest families |
| **The Cliff Edges** | Goat paths, wild herbs, ruins of older structures, best views |

### Street Patterns

Solterra Bay grew organically over centuries—**not a grid**:

- Main streets follow the contour of the slope (easier walking)
- Side streets climb steeply, often becoming stairs
- Some "streets" are too narrow for carts—foot traffic only
- Dead ends, unexpected courtyards, passages through buildings
- Locals know shortcuts; visitors get lost

**Navigation:**
People use landmarks, not addresses:
- "The house past the fig tree, before you reach the broken fountain"
- "Turn left at the old anchor, go up the stairs, it's the green door"

## Domestic Architecture

### Fisherman's Cottage

- One or two rooms
- Stone walls, minimal plaster
- Single wooden shutter per window (no glass)
- Flat roof or single-pitch tile
- Outdoor cooking area shared with neighbors
- Nets and tools stored on roof or hung on walls

### Tradesman's House

- Two stories: workshop/shop below, living above
- Stone with plaster, might be color-washed
- Wooden shutters, maybe oiled cloth in one window
- Small balcony overlooking street
- Interior courtyard if prosperous (shared if not)

### Merchant's House

- Three stories possible
- Cut stone, smooth plaster, intentional color
- Multiple balconies with ironwork
- Glass in the best windows
- Private courtyard with fountain or cistern
- Separate kitchen building (fire risk)
- The library was one of these before conversion

### Villa (Wealthy/Old Family)

- Built around central courtyard
- Multiple wings, possibly different eras
- Best materials, most glass, most wood
- Gardens (water is precious; gardens signal wealth)
- Often on upper slopes for views and breezes

---

## Public Buildings

### The Library (Former Merchant Villa)

- Former merchant's villa, converted 150 years ago
- Two stories with courtyard garden (overgrown but charming)
- Reading room with high windows—the building's best feature
- Upper floor: archives, rare books, Cornelius's nest
- Basement: mysterious, possibly magical, off-limits
- Original family's decorative elements still visible (tile floors, carved lintels)
- Architecture reflects former wealth now faded
- The building tells a story of decline the series will reverse

### The Temples

- Whitewashed (sets them apart from residential buildings)
- Older temple higher up the hill (original settlement)
- Temple of Althaia (healing) near harbor—practical for sailors
- Columns or pilasters suggesting classical forms
- Open-air altars in courtyards
- Bell towers for marking the hours

### The Town Hall

- Occupies one side of the main square
- Arched loggia providing public shade
- Bell tower for announcements
- The most "official" looking building in town

### Harbor Facilities

- Stone sea walls (ancient, patched many times)
- Wooden piers extending from stone bases
- Warehouses: massive stone ground floors, lighter upper stories
- The fish market: open-sided, roof for shade
- Communal fire pits: stone-lined areas on the harbor front

## Distinctive Local Features

### Exterior Stairs

- Upper floors often accessed from outside
- Saves interior space
- Creates street-level visual interest
- Social opportunity (neighbors chat on stairs)

### Rooftop Life

- Flat roofs used for drying (fish, laundry, herbs)
- Sleeping outdoors in summer heat
- Rooftop terraces on wealthier homes
- Some rooftops connected—unofficial elevated pathways

### Cisterns

- Rainwater collection essential (limited fresh water)
- Public cisterns in squares
- Private cisterns under courtyards
- The sound of water trickling signals prosperity

### Outdoor Ovens

- Small clay domes in courtyards
- Shared between neighboring families
- Cassius's bakery has the only large commercial oven

### The Painted Doors

- One area of personal expression
- Family colors, traditional patterns, individual taste
- A door's condition signals household situation
- Repainting a door is an event; neighbors notice

### Ceramic Tiles

Solterra Bay's distinctive craft—tiles appear throughout the town:

- Temple floors and walls
- Fountain basins and public spaces
- Wealthy home thresholds and courtyards
- Decorative panels on important buildings
- Three competing families produce all local tiles (see: Tile Families document)

## Light and Shadow

### How Buildings Handle Light

**Without Glass (Most Buildings):**
- Shutters open during day, closed at night and in rain
- Rooms are dim; life happens near windows or outdoors
- Interior walls often whitewashed to reflect available light
- Oil lamps and candles for evening (or magical glow-stones for those who can afford them)

**With Glass (Wealthy Buildings, the Library):**
- A luxury that changes how a room feels
- Library reading room's high windows are a major feature
- Glass lets in light while keeping out wind and dust
- Colored glass in temples is rare and impressive

### Shadow as Architecture

Mediterranean buildings are designed around shade:

- North-facing rooms are cooler, preferred for summer
- Loggias and porticos create shaded outdoor space
- Narrow streets shade each other
- Trees are precious for their shade
- The progression from bright sun to cool shadow is a physical experience

## The Sensory Experience

### What You See

- Warm stone in sun, grey in shadow
- Faded plaster in sunset colors
- Terracotta roofs at different angles
- Laundry on lines between buildings
- Cats on windowsills, goats on rooftops
- The glitter of the bay at the end of every downhill street

### What You Hear

- Footsteps on stone (different sounds: cobbles, stairs, flagstones)
- Shutters opening in the morning, closing at midday
- Temple bells marking the hours
- Water in fountains and cisterns
- Voices carrying in narrow streets

### What You Feel

- Cool stone walls on a hot day
- The temperature drop stepping from sun into a building
- Uneven stairs worn smooth by centuries of feet
- The breeze funneling through narrow streets

### What You Smell

- Sun-warmed stone
- Plaster dust
- Whatever's cooking nearby
- The sea, always the sea
