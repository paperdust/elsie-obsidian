# NPE Analysis: The Midpoint Twist (Safe as Stone)

**The Event:** Chapter 10 (Midpoint). Melaina (Suspect D) is found petrified.
**The Assumption:** The "Serial Petrifier" has struck again. The mob was right; it's a monster run amok.
**The Truth:** Photine did it.

## The Physics of the Decision
Why would a mother force-freeze the child she killed to protect?

*   **Field Pressure:** **"The Lynch Mob"**
    *   By Ch 10, the town is terrified. The "Anti-Gorgon" sentiment Demos stoked has turned into a vigilante hunt.
    *   Theo (The Law) is coming to arrest Melaina.
    *   The Mob (The Faction) is gathering to burn the Enclave.

*   **The Calculation:**
    *   If Melaina is arrested: She will be examined. The Weep will be found. She will be exiled/executed.
    *   If Melaina is found by the Mob: She dies.
    *   If Melaina is **"The Victim"**: She is safe.

## The Strategy (Camouflage)
Photine turns Melaina into a statue to:
1.  **Hide her in plain sight:** No one looks for a fugitive in a statue garden.
2.  **Clear her name:** "She can't be the killer; she's a victim!"
3.  **Pause the Disease:** This is the ultimate "Stasis." The Weep cannot progress if her cells are stone. It buys Photine time to find the *real* cure without the drain on her own life.

**The NPE Vector:** `V_Protect` shifts from "Active Healing" to "Passive Shielding." It is the Logic of the Bunker. She is locking her daughter in a safe room where no one can hurt her—even if that room is her own body.
