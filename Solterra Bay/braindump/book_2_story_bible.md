## 1. THE CORE MYSTERY

### The Premise
Solterra Bay is panicked by rumors of a "Feral Gorgon" roaming the cisterns. Tensions explode when **Brother Demos**, a vocal advocate for quarantining the Gorgon population, is found **petrified** in the Temple Archives.

### The Truth (Spoilers)
*   **The Killer:** **Sister Photine** (Head Healer).
*   **The Motive:** **Desperate Protection.** Photine is the secret mother of **Melaina**, a Gorgon suffering from "Medusa's Weep" (degenerative gaze). Demos discovered Photine was draining her own life force to keep Melaina stable. He threatened to report her to the Council to save her life (Protective Intervention). Photine petrified him to "pause" his interference so she could finish the treatment.
*   **The Twist:** Demos wasn't attacking; he was reaching out to help her.

### The Ticking Clock
The **Petrification Spell** becomes permanent after **72 Hours**.
*   **Start:** Chapter 2 (Discovery).
*   **End:** Chapter 19 (Sunset on Day 3).
*   **Stakes:** If the mystery isn't solved by sunset, Demos is dead forever.

## 2. CHARACTERS & ROLES

### The Protagonists
*   **Cornelius (The Sleuth):** Initially biased by "Biological Determinism" (believes Gorgons are naturally dangerous). Must learn that Nurture > Nature.
*   **Zeph (The Heart):** Identifies with Melaina. Becomes her champion against the mob.
*   **Imelda (The Anchor):** Finds the body. Provides the emotional pressure on Photine ("You look so tired, dear").

### The Suspects (The Gorgon Enclave)
*   **Melaina (Suspect D):** The Victim. Photine's daughter. Consumed by the Gaze.
*   **Kyra Kallistos (Suspect B):** The "False Face." A passing Gorgon cousin. Hated Demos for threatening to unmask her and ruin her engagement.
*   **Mother Ligeia (Suspect C):** The "Shield." Blind Matriarch of the Enclave. Hated Demos for trying to breach/condemn their sanctuary.
*   **Xanthe (Suspect E):** The "Glare." Radical activist. Hated Demos for refusing to acknowledge her brother's humanity (Triage death).
*   **Myron (Suspect F):** The "Mirror." Sculptor. Hated Demos for insulting his vision and destroying his work.

## 4. THE SUBPLOT: THE GREAT BOOK CULL

### The Conflict
The Temple needs money (ironically, to treat patients like Melaina). Imelda organizes a **Charity Book Sale** and orders Cornelius to donate 50 books from the Library's "Duplicate/Damaged" stock.

### The Thematic Mirror (Sacrifice)
*   **Main Plot:** Photine is dangerously sacrificing her own life force to save Melaina. Demos tried to stop her excessive sacrifice.
*   **Subplot:** Cornelius is asked to sacrifice his beloved books to fund the Temple.
*   **Cornelius's Arc:** He initially refuses to part with his hoard ("They are all precious!").
*   **The Resolution:** He learns that **True Value** comes from letting things go to help others (Fundraising). He voluntarily sells a rare book to help Photine, mirroring her willingness to give everything for Melaina.

## 5. PLOT STRUCTURE (The 3-Day Arc)

### ACT 1: The Statue (Day 1)
*   **Ch 1:** Demos argues with Euryale in the square about "Triage" and "Public Safety."
*   **Ch 2 (Inciting Incident):** Imelda finds Demos petrified in the Archives.
*   **Ch 5 (Threshold):** The Town Council orders a "Gorgon Roundup." Zeph hides Melaina in the Library basement.

### ACT 2: The Silence (Day 2)
*   **Ch 6:** Photine takes over Demos's duties. She is exhausted, erratic.
*   **Ch 9:** Photine realizes she cannot cure Melaina here. She needs the Capital.
*   **Ch 10 (Midpoint):** **Melaina is Petrified.** The town thinks the "Monster" struck again. In reality, Photine did it to pause the disease and make her portable.
*   **Ch 13:** Cornelius notices the "Stone" smell is **Sandalwood** (Medical), not Sulfur (Magical).

### ACT 3: The Rescue (Day 3)
*   **Ch 15:** Zeph finds the Birth Record connecting Photine to Melaina.
*   **Ch 17:** Cornelius tracks Photine's finances. She is selling *everything* (family heirlooms) to buy passage on a smuggler's ship.
*   **Ch 19 (Climax):** Sunset at the Docks.
    *   Photine is loading the "Melaina Statue".
    *   Cornelius confronts her: "You can leave with her, but Demos dies in 10 minutes."
    *   Photine chooses Redemption. They rush back to the Temple.
*   **Ch 20 (Resolution):** Demos is un-petrified. He confirms he was trying to save Photine. Photine surrenders, but the town (led by Cornelius) agrees to help Melaina get treatment legally.

## 4. THEMATIC FORCES (NPE)
*   **Love vs. Duty:** Photine sacrifices her Duty (Healer) for Love (Mother).
*   **Resource Scarcity:** The tragedy happens because the town lacks the resources to care for the vulnerable (Gorgons), forcing desperate measures.
*   **Prejudice:** The town assumes "Biology is Destiny" (Gorgons = Monsters), blinding them to the human tragedy.
