## 1. The Solterra Bay Library

*Cornelius's domain. The heart of the series.*

### The Building

**History:** Former merchant villa of the Archontides family, donated to the town 150 years ago when the last heir died without children. The family's shipping fortune had already faded; the books were their remaining treasure.

**Architecture:**
- Two stories around a central courtyard
- Honey-colored stone, faded to grey in the shadows
- Original Kallistos tile floors (150 years old, worn smooth)
- High windows in the main reading room—the building's glory
- A Doukas tile panel by the entrance (the smiling dragon Cornelius despises)
- Veneti replacement tiles in the east corridor (adequate)

### The Spaces

**The Entry Hall**
- The smiling dragon tile panel
- A battered wooden desk where Imelda or Zeph greets visitors
- Cornelius's "public perch"—a cushioned ledge where he can observe arrivals
- Smell of old paper and dust and, faintly, mint

**The Main Reading Room**
- High windows, southern exposure—afternoon light streams in
- Long wooden tables, mismatched chairs accumulated over decades
- The water clock that gurgles (Cornelius's nemesis)
- Yiayia Despina's unofficial reserved chair by the window
- Glow-stones in wall sconces for darker days

**The Stacks**
- Three connected rooms of shelving
- Organization system only Cornelius fully understands
- A mix of languages, subjects, and eras
- Some shelves immaculate; others dusty and forgotten

**The Courtyard Garden**
- Once formal; now beautifully overgrown
- Herbs gone wild—especially the mint (Cornelius's doing)
- A dry fountain that hasn't worked in decades
- Stone benches warmed by afternoon sun
- Where Imelda hosts informal afternoon tea

**The Upper Floor**
- The Rare Book Room (climate charm, locked, Cornelius has opinions about access)
- Archive storage (boxes, crates, unsorted donations)
- Cornelius's nest (private, no visitors, don't ask)

**The Basement**
- Off-limits
- The Presence in the Stacks lives here (maybe)
- Cornelius refuses to discuss it

### The Collection

| Category | Character |
|----------|-----------|
| **Philosophy and History** | Strong—the original family's interest |
| **Navigation and Maritime** | Excellent—sailor donations over generations |
| **Poetry and Literature** | Extensive but disorganized |
| **Medical and Herbal** | Good—Sister Photine borrows regularly |
| **Religious Texts** | From dissolved temple libraries; multiple traditions |
| **Languages** | Common, Hellenic, Phoenic, Old Etruscan, others |
| **Local Records** | Incomplete but valuable—family histories, temple records |
| **Rare Books** | A few genuine treasures; mostly sentimental rarities |

### Social Function

- One of the few truly neutral spaces in town
- Where the tile families' heirs might accidentally meet
- Where sailors find navigation charts
- Where Yiayia Despina holds court
- Where secrets hide in plain sight among the shelves

### Cornelius's Opinion

"It is adequate. The collection is undervalued, the building undermaintained, and the patrons—with rare exceptions—fail to appreciate what they have access to. Nevertheless. It is mine."

---

## 2. Cassius's Bakery

*The town's morning heartbeat. Where news travels faster than bread cools.*

### The Building

**Location:** Lower town, directly adjacent to the library (the smell drifts through library windows)

**Architecture:**
- Ground floor of a two-story building; Cassius lives above
- The great oven dominates the back—brick dome, always warm
- Front counter opens directly onto the street
- Small interior seating (two tables, rarely used)
- Outdoor benches along the wall where people wait and talk

### The Spaces

**The Counter**
- Display of the day's bread, pastries, honey cakes
- Cassius's domain—he sees everyone who enters
- The smell hits you before you're through the door

**The Great Oven**
- The only commercial-sized oven in town
- Brick dome, ancient, perfectly maintained
- Where townspeople bring dishes for communal baking
- Cassius knows what every family is cooking

**The Waiting Area**
- Benches outside along the building's sunny wall
- Where people wait for their baking slots
- Where gossip happens "accidentally"
- Where you learn who's feuding, courting, traveling, sick

### The Proprietor

**Cassius Nerva**
- Human, Latian heritage, age 48
- Fourth-generation baker
- Widower, no children, married to his work
- Knows everything about everyone
- Never gossips—just listens, remembers, and occasionally shares something useful
- Potential slow-burn romance interest for Imelda

**Character:** Warm, steady, patient. Flour perpetually dusting his forearms. Speaks carefully, asks good questions. Notices everything, judges little.

### Daily Rhythm

| Time | Activity |
|------|----------|
| Before dawn | Cassius starts the bread |
| First bell | First loaves come out; early customers |
| Mid-morning | Communal baking rush; gossip peaks |
| Midday | Quieter; Cassius rests briefly |
| Afternoon | Pastries, honey cakes for tea time |
| Evening | Closed; Cassius cleans, prepares for tomorrow |

### Social Function

- Where you hear news before it's officially announced
- Where feuding neighbors must share bench space
- Where the tile families' servants buy bread (and report back)
- Where Imelda stops every morning
- Cassius is a potential witness to almost anything

### Cornelius's Opinion

"The proximity of the bakery to the library is an ongoing tribulation. The smell is... pervasive. However, Cassius Nerva keeps impeccable mental records and does not speak carelessly. These are admirable qualities, even in a tradesman who insists on sending honey cakes to the library every week whether anyone requested them or not."

## 3. The Oar & Anchor

*Where the town spends its evenings. Louder than the bakery, looser than the bathhouse.*

### The Building

**Location:** Harbor front, where the working docks meet the town proper

**Architecture:**
- Ancient stone building, older than most of the town
- Ground floor tavern; upper floor rooms for rent
- Wide doorway opens directly onto the harbor
- A covered porch with tables overlooking the water
- Dark interior, low ceiling, smoky from the cooking fire

### The Spaces

**The Main Room**
- Long wooden bar, scarred by generations of use
- Mismatched tables and benches
- A massive fireplace for cooking and warmth
- Fishing nets, old oars, and nautical debris as decoration
- Dim enough for private conversations; bright enough to see your drink

**The Porch**
- Best seats in the house—harbor view, evening breeze
- Where deals are made, stories are told
- Captain Mago Hanno's unofficial reserved spot
- Sunset light turns everything golden

**The Kitchen**
- Behind the bar, partially visible
- Revithada always simmering
- Kakavia when the catch is good

**The Upstairs Rooms**
- Six small rooms for rent
- Clean enough, basic, no questions asked
- Where visiting sailors sleep
- Where someone might hide if they needed to

### The Proprietors

**Despina and Yannis Kraikos**
- Married couple, ages 55 and 58
- Despina handles the bar and the money
- Yannis handles the kitchen and the drunks
- Been running the Oar & Anchor for thirty years
- Unflappable, professional, seen everything

### The Regulars

- **Captain Mago Hanno** — His crew fills a corner table most nights
- **Alexandros Doukas** — The tile family's charmer, buying drinks, making deals
- **Off-duty fishermen** — Spending the day's earnings
- **Visiting sailors** — News from other ports

### Social Function

- Where you go to be part of the town's social life
- Where news arrives with incoming ships
- Where deals are made over drinks
- Where arguments happen (and sometimes end badly)
- Where someone might ask dangerous questions

### Cornelius's Opinion

"I do not frequent taverns. However, I understand the Oar & Anchor serves a social function for those who require loud companionship and fermented beverages. Captain Mago has, on occasion, sent a bowl of kakavia to the library. I do not discourage this."

---

## 4. The Bathhouse

*Where everyone is equal, and no one can keep secrets.*

### The Building

**Location:** Middle town, fed by the old aqueduct

**History:** One of the oldest public buildings, maintained by the town council. Bathing is civic duty and social glue.

**Architecture:**
- Stone building, partially underground (cooler)
- Central courtyard open to the sky
- Multiple smaller pools rather than large communal baths
- Kallistos tiles throughout (traditional, ancient, beautiful)
- Steam and the smell of olive oil soap

### The Spaces

**The Entry Hall**
- Where you pay the small fee (subsidized; everyone can afford it)
- Where you leave your clothes in cubicles
- Where social rank disappears with your garments
- Old Nikos presides from his bench by the door

**The Warm Room**
- Transitional space with heated stone benches
- Where you adjust to the temperature
- Where casual conversation happens before bathing

**The Five Pools**

Each pool is small—six to eight people comfortably—creating natural conversation groups:

| Pool | Character | Who Gravitates There |
|------|-----------|---------------------|
| **The Hot Pool** | Hottest water, closest to the furnace | Those wanting serious heat; older folks with aching joints |
| **The Harbor Pool** | Medium heat, decorated with fish tiles | Sailors, dock workers, those telling sea stories |
| **The Merchant's Pool** | Medium heat, best tiles, slightly larger | Business owners, traders, those making deals |
| **The Garden Pool** | Cooler, open to the courtyard, grape vines overhead | Those wanting air and light; longer conversations |
| **The Cold Plunge** | Bracing cold, small, quick dips only | Brief visits between hot soaks; the brave; the showing off |

**The Courtyard**
- Open to the sky, shaded by old grape vines
- Stone benches for cooling down
- Where you oil your skin, dry off, talk quietly

### The Staff

**Keeper: Old Nikos**
- Age 70, been running the bathhouse for forty years
- Knows everyone's bodies (scars, ailments, secrets)
- Discreet as a stone
- Assigns newcomers to pools based on mysterious criteria

**Attendants:**
- Young people who manage towels, oils, cleaning, heating
- See everything, learn quickly not to talk about it

### Social Function

- The great equalizer—rich and poor bathe together
- Which pool you choose says something about you
- Where physical vulnerability creates conversational intimacy
- Where rivals must share space and maintain civility
- Where information flows between social classes

### Cornelius's Opinion

"I do not bathe publicly. Dragons are fastidious by nature; I maintain my scales privately. However, the bathhouse is an effective location for gathering information, as humans become inexplicably candid when undressed and warm. The division into smaller pools is sensible—it creates natural groupings for observation."

## 5. The Docks

*Where Solterra Bay meets the world. Work, commerce, and the smell of fish.*

### The Area

**Location:** The entire harbor front, from the fish market to the warehouses

**Character:** Working waterfront—not picturesque, but vital. This is where the money comes from.

### The Spaces

**The Fish Market**
- Open-sided building, roof for shade
- Dawn auction—fishermen sell the night's catch
- By mid-morning, the best is gone
- The smell is... significant

**The Piers**
- Stone bases, wooden planking (always being repaired)
- Where fishing boats tie up
- Where trading vessels dock
- Always busy, always loud

**The Warehouses**
- Massive stone buildings along the waterfront
- Where goods are stored awaiting sale or shipment
- Where grain and lentils arrive by boat
- Dark, cool, full of interesting hiding spots

**The Shipwright's Yard**
- Where boats are built and repaired
- The smell of tar and fresh wood

**The Communal Fire Pits**
- Stone-lined areas on the harbor front
- Where evening fish grilling happens
- Social gathering spot after the workday

**The Harbor Master's Office**
- Small stone building on the main pier
- Where ships are registered, fees paid, disputes settled

### The People

**Harbor Master: Theron Gavros**
- Age 50, former sailor, missing two fingers
- Efficient, fair, mildly corrupt (small bribes for small favors)
- Knows every ship that's passed through in twenty years

### Social Function

- Where news arrives before anywhere else
- Where strangers first set foot in town
- Where working-class Solterra Bay lives
- Where cargo might disappear if you paid the right people

### Cornelius's Opinion

"The docks smell of fish, tar, and unwashed sailors. I avoid the area except when investigation requires it. However, information flows through the harbor like water, and Captain Mago Hanno understands the value of discretion. Also, the fish is fresher there than anywhere else in town."

---

## 6. The Temple of Althaia

*Healing, peace, and the smell of growing things.*

### The Building

**Location:** Near the harbor (practical for injured sailors), but set back from the noise

**Architecture:**
- Whitewashed stone (marking it as sacred)
- Small but graceful—columns framing the entrance
- Open courtyard at the center
- The herb garden is the temple's glory

### The Spaces

**The Entrance Hall**
- Cool, quiet, immediate sense of peace
- A small altar for offerings
- Benches for those waiting

**The Treatment Room**
- Where Sister Photine works
- Simple cots, clean linens
- Shelves of salves, poultices, bandages
- Warm with healing magic

**The Recovery Courtyard**
- Where patients rest among the herbs
- Stone benches, dappled shade
- Cornelius's "acceptable" sunning spot

**The Herb Garden**
- Sister Photine's pride
- Organized beds of medicinal plants
- Where Cornelius grazes (mint section)
- Open to visitors who respect the space

**The Inner Sanctuary**
- Small room for the goddess's statue
- Where serious prayers are offered
- Quiet, private

### Social Function

- Where you go when hurt or ill
- Where you visit someone recovering (social obligation)
- Where quiet conversations happen away from eavesdroppers
- A place of genuine peace

### Cornelius's Opinion

"The Temple of Althaia is one of the few locations where silence is respected. Sister Photine maintains excellent records, returns library books on time, and has never once attempted to pet me without permission. The herb garden is also... adequate. The mint, in particular."

---

## 7. The Washhouse

*Where laundry gets done and secrets come out.*

### The Building

**Location:** Lower town, near the aqueduct outlet where fresh water flows

**Architecture:**
- Functional stone building, open-sided
- Large stone basins fed by running water
- Covered roof for shade and rain protection
- Worn smooth by generations of scrubbing

### The Spaces

**The Washing Basins**
- Long stone troughs where laundry is scrubbed
- Running water keeps them fresh
- People work side by side, elbow to elbow
- The rhythm of scrubbing, wringing, beating

**The Drying Lines**
- Ropes strung across the courtyard
- A maze of hanging sheets and clothing
- Where private conversations happen behind the linens

**The Gossip Corner**
- Unofficial area where people rest between loads
- Stone bench, shade, a shared water jug
- Where the real information exchange happens

### The Social Reality

**Who's There:**
- Anyone doing their household's laundry
- Servants from wealthy houses
- Bachelors managing their own washing
- Parents with children "helping"
- Older folks who've been coming for decades

**What Gets Discussed:**
- Who came home drunk
- Whose son or daughter is seeing whom
- Which families are struggling
- What was heard through thin walls
- What was found in pockets

**The Hierarchy:**
- Older folks hold court; younger ones listen
- Servants from wealthy houses have status (better gossip)
- New arrivals must earn their place

### Social Function

- The working-class information network
- Where domestic details become public knowledge
- Where someone might plant a rumor or trace one back

### Cornelius's Opinion

"Imelda informs me the washhouse is 'more efficient than any spy network' and that 'if you want to know something about anyone in this town, ask the people who wash their sheets.' I have found this assessment accurate for investigative purposes."

---

## 8. The Main Square

*Where Solterra Bay comes together. Commerce, ceremony, and spectacle.*

### The Space

**Location:** Heart of the lower town, where three main streets converge

**Architecture:**
- Roughly rectangular, paved with ancient stones
- Town hall on the north side (arched loggia for shade)
- The central fountain (ancient, functional, social hub)
- Cassius's bakery visible down one street
- The library visible up the hill

### Key Features

**The Fountain**
- Old, beautiful, Kallistos tiles around the basin
- The sound of water is the square's heartbeat
- Where you meet people "by accident"
- Where children play, dogs drink, old folks sit

**The Town Hall Loggia**
- Covered arcade providing public shade
- Where official announcements are read
- Where people gather during rain

**The Market Space**
- On market days, stalls fill the square
- Fish, vegetables, imported goods
- The tile families' competing stalls

**The Festival Space**
- Where celebrations happen
- Each tile family decorates one third
- Dancing, music, eating, drinking

### Daily Rhythm

| Time | Activity |
|------|----------|
| Morning | Market activity, gossip at the fountain |
| Midday | Quiet—everyone escapes the heat |
| Afternoon | Activity resumes; children playing |
| Evening | Social promenade before dinner |

### Social Function

- The most public space in town
- Where announcements are made
- Where chance encounters happen
- Where the town performs its identity

### Cornelius's Opinion

"The main square is loud, crowded, and frequently contains children eating sticky things. However, it is efficient for observing social dynamics, and the fountain provides useful cover for eavesdropping—not that I would engage in such activities."

---

## 9. The Widow's Perch

*Where people go to think, grieve, or simply breathe.*

### The Space

**Location:** Upper town, at the cliff's edge, overlooking the entire bay

**History:** Named generations ago for those who watched for ships that never returned. Now a place for anyone who needs perspective.

**Character:** Beautiful, melancholy, peaceful. The kind of place that makes you quiet.

### The Features

**The Terrace**
- Natural rock shelf, improved over generations
- Low stone wall at the edge
- Three ancient olive trees providing shade
- Stone benches worn smooth by sitting

**The View**
- The entire bay spread below
- The harbor, the town climbing the hillside
- The mountains curving around
- The open sea beyond
- Spectacular at sunset

**The Memorial Stones**
- Along the back wall, small carved stones
- Names of those lost at sea
- Families add new ones; no one removes old ones
- Some so weathered they're illegible

**The Shrine**
- Small altar to the sea's dead
- Offerings left—flowers, coins, small items
- Tended by no one and everyone

### Unwritten Rules

- Don't intrude on someone's solitude without invitation
- Don't bring children
- Don't be loud
- Acknowledge others with a nod, nothing more
- Leave offerings if you've lost someone to the sea

### When People Come Here

- After a death
- Before a major decision
- When a relationship is in crisis
- When they need to think
- At sunset, just for the beauty

### Social Function

- Where you go to be alone (but might accept company)
- Where serious conversations happen
- Where grief is processed
- Where lovers go to talk (or not talk)

### Cornelius's Opinion

"The Widow's Perch is one of the few locations where humans reliably practice silence. The view is adequate—I can see the entire harbor from there, which has investigative utility. The olive trees are old and dignified. I have been known to visit on occasion, though not for sentimental reasons. The updrafts are good for flying."
