**Physical Description:**
- Appear largely human at first glance
- Skin often has subtle iridescence, especially when wet

**The "Dangerous Song" Myth:**

- The old stories are propaganda from sailors who made bad decisions
- Modern sirens find the stereotype tiresome

**Magic:**
- Voice magic (emotional resonance, enhanced persuasion, NOT compulsion)

- One of Captain Mago Hanno's crew is a siren
- The Oar & Anchor occasionally hosts siren musicians

- Patience and stillness (can wait motionless for hours)
- Excellent poker faces (their snakes give nothing away)
- Dry, deadpan humor

**The Petrifying Gaze:**
- Does not actually turn people to stone
- It's an extremely intense, unblinking stare that makes people deeply uncomfortable

---

### Empousai
