# NPE Analysis: The Physics of "Triage"

This document maps the invisible forces driving the central conflict of Book 2 using the NPE v1.0 schema.

## 1. The Field Generator (The Context)
The conflict occurs within a **High-Resistance Field** called **"Resource Scarcity."**
*   **Field Strength:** 8/10.
*   **Effect:** Amplifies *Fear* vectors and Damps *Mercy* vectors.
*   **Physics:** There is literally not enough mana/medicine to go around. One patient's survival physically costs another's.

## 2. Force Analysis: Brother Demos
Demos is driven by **utilitarian calculus**, not malice.

*   **Primary Vector: `V_Efficiency` (+9)**
    *   *Direction:* Maximize survivorship for the maximum number of citizens.
    *   *Logic:* "Spending 100 Mana on one incurable Gorgon kills ten children with curable fever."
*   **Secondary Vector: `V_Duty_to_Institution` (+8)**
    *   *Direction:* Protect the Temple's solvency.
    *   *Logic:* If the Temple goes bankrupt treating "charity cases," *everyone* dies.
*   **Resistance Vector: `V_Empathy` (-4)**
    *   *Direction:* He actively suppresses empathy. He views it as a weakness that clouds judgment.
*   **NPE State:** Demos is **High-Stability, Low-Elasticity**. He cannot bend rules; he breaks.

## 3. Force Analysis: Sister Photine
Photine is driven by **deontological duty** (and secret maternal instinct).

*   **Primary Vector: `V_Oath` (+10)**
    *   *Direction:* "First, do no harm." / "Save *this* patient."
    *   *Logic:* A Healer does not choose who lives. A Healer fights Death everywhere.
*   **Secret Vector: `V_Malignant_Love` (+10)**
    *   *Direction:* Protect Melaina at *any* cost.
    *   *Type:* This is a **Rogue Vector**. It overrides her Ethics (+8) and her Logic (+6). It allows her to justify theft and, ultimately, violence (petrification) as "Medical Necessity."
*   **Resistance Vector: `V_Transparency` (-8)**
    *   *Direction:* She cannot be honest because honesty = Melaina's exile.
*   **NPE State:** Photine is **High-Entropy**. She is holding a chaotic system together by sheer will.

## 4. The Collision (The Threshold Event)
The murder happens because their primary vectors inevitably intersect in the **Archives**.

*   **Vector Clash:**
    *   Demos (`V_Efficiency`) brings the **Evidence** (Melaina's chart = Resource Drain).
    *   Photine (`V_Malignant_Love`) brings the **Silence** (The Spell).
*   **The Physics:**
    *   Demos threatens the valid target of Photine's Love vector.
    *   Photine's defined parameters ("Healer") *should* prevent violence (`Lethality Coefficient: 0`).
    *   **CRITICAL FAILURE:** She redefines the violence (`V_Petrify`) as "treatment" (Stasis). This bypasses her moral block. She tells herself she is "pausing" the problem, not killing the man.

## Conclusion
They are not "Good vs Evil." They are **"The Many" (`V_Efficiency`) vs "The One" (`V_Love`)**.
In a resource-rich environment (Low Scarcity Field), they would just be coworkers debating policy.
The **Scarcity Field** turns their philosophical difference into a lethal kinetic event.
