# Story Bible: Solterra Bay Reference

## STORY OVERVIEW
**Premise:** It is the Spring Trading Feast in Solterra Bay, a time of joy and commerce. But when a foreign sailor is found dead in the vault of the Solterra Bay Library and a priceless collection of letters goes missing, Cornelius Drake (a fastidious Library Dragon) must team up with his chaotic teenage intern Zeph to solve the crime before the Feast ends and the killer escapes on the tide.

**Genre:** Cozy Fantasy Mystery (NPE Module: Cozy Mystery v1.2)
**Tone:** "Heat, Light, and Stone." Whimsical, warm, low-stress, with high social stakes.
**Thematic Question:** *Can Order (Cornelius) coexist with Chaos (Life/People), or must one destroy the other?*

## CHARACTERS

### The Sleuth (Protagonist): Cornelius Drake
*   **Archetype:** The Intellectual Sleuth.
*   **Role:** Library Dragon / Proprietor.
*   **Want:** To retrieve the stolen "Kallistos Letters" and restore the sanctity (silence) of his library.
*   **Fear:** That he is actually *bad* at protecting his hoard; that he is unnecessary.
*   **Wound:** Intellectual Loneliness. He connects with books because people are "inefficient."
*   **Skill:** **Omniglot Reading.** He can read *anything* (languages, ciphers, lip-reading) and analyze handwriting/ink with forensic precision.
*   **Quirk:** Consumes raw mint constantly; refers to humans as "The [Job Title]."

### The Sidekick (Foil): Zephyr "Zeph" Taraki
*   **Archetype:** The Action/Heart Sidekick.
*   **Role:** Library Intern.
*   **Want:** To prove he's not just a screw-up kid; to protect the library (which he secretly loves).
*   **Skill:** **Physical Dexterity & Social Navigation.** He can open doors, climb shelves, and talk to "youths."
*   **Heritage:** Lamassu-touched (Guardian instinct).

### The Authority (Obstacle): Captain Theo Melas
*   **Archetype:** The Weary Professional.
*   **Role:** Captain of the Town Watch.
*   **Dynamic:** "Stop investigating, Dragon." Theo treats the murder as a procedural; Cornelius treats it as a personal insult.

### The Victim (Suspect A): Elias of Tyre
*   **Role:** The Hired Thief / Dead Sailor.
*   **Secret:** Was hired by **Eudora** (The Suitor) to steal the letters.
*   **Method:** Spent the previous evening getting **Petros Kallistos** drunk to steal the **Library Vault Password**.
*   **Timing:** The specific night was chosen because the **Winter Storm Wards** are lowered for the Trading Feast, weakening the protections.
*   **Death:** Successfully entered the vault but was surprised by a *second* intruder (Alexandros). Killed by Alex to silence the witness.

### The Killer (The Intruder): Alexandros Doukas
*   **Role:** The Salesman / House Doukas Scion.
*   **Motive:** **Financial Desperation (Greed/Pride).** He believes the "Kallistos Letters" (archived in the vault) contain the secret glaze recipe.
*   **Method:** Tried to break into the vault to steal the letters. Met Elias at the vault. Alexandros fought him over the book, struck him down (panic/greed), took the book, and fled.

### The Suspects (The Flower)
*   **Suspect B (The Rival): Sophia Doukas.**
    *   *Motive:* A protege in tile making that has been belittled by Petros and Dimitra for years. Hates house Kallistos and is not afraid to say so.
    *   *Clue:* Her handkerchief found near the side entrance.
*   **Suspect C (The Debtor): Captain Mago Hanno.**
    *   *Motive:* Owed Elias money.
    *   *Clue:* Was seen arguing with Elias at the Oar & Anchor.
*   **Suspect D (The False Target): Petros Kallistos.**
    *   *Motive:* The Black Sheep. Needs money. Hates his father.
    *   *Clue:* Cornelius finds a **scrap of paper** in the victim's pocket with the Vault Code written in **Petros's Handwriting**. (Red Herring: Elias tricked Petros into writing it down while drunk).
    *   *Status:* Cornelius is 100% sure it's Petros until the Midpoint.
*   **Suspect E (The Gossip): Sister Photine.**
    *  *Motive:* Was treating Elias for a "shameful" disease (false rumor). Actually treating him for a tint-plague, might have accidentally poisoned him with a wrong medicine.
    * *Clue:* Elias had red splotches on his skin, where he applied her tonic, hinting at an allergic reaction to it.
*   **Suspect F (The Hirer): Eudora of Naxos.**
    *   **Role:** A wealthy merchant's daughter / New arrival.
    *   *Motive:* **Romance.** She is courting **Dimitra Veneti** and wants to marry into the powerful family. She hired Elias to get the "Family Letters" as a supreme courtship gift (the secrets of a rival family).
    *   *Clue:* Elias' crew saw her talk to him. They exchanged coin. Eudora claims she bought information about the best tile merchants from him.

## RELATIONSHIP MAP
*   **Cornelius <-> Zeph:** "Annoyed Master/Bratty Apprentice" evolving to "Partners."
*   **Cornelius <-> Theo:** "Amateur/Pro." Friction over methods.
*   **Imelda (Head Librarian):** The only one who knows the *truth* about the letters (they are love letters, not recipes). She is keeping this secret to protect the family dignity (A "Cozy" complication).

---

## WORLD & SETTING
*   **Solterra Bay:** Vertical stone town, spring sun, salt air.
*   **The Library:** The main set. A sanctuary violated.
*   **The Trading Feast:** The ticking clock. The town is chaotic, loud, and full of strangers.
*   **Technology:** Early Renaissance (Printing Press). No guns.
*   **Magic:** Minor, domestic. No resurrection.

---

## STAKES & PROMISE
*   **Emotional Stakes:** Cornelius's sense of safety/control. If he can't protect the library, what is he?
*   **External Stakes:** The financial collapse of House Doukas (if Alexandros succeeds) or House Kallistos (if the letters are leaked/misunderstood).
*   **Ending Promise:** The letters are returned. The "Secret" is revealed to be mundane (Love, not Glaze). Alexandros is arrested (calmly). The Feast happens.
