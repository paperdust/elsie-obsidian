**Status:** Generated (NPE Step 2)
**Genre:** Cozy Mystery / Fantasy (Cozy Module v1.2)
**Premise:** When a beloved healer is turned to stone, a dragon librarian must uncover the truth behind a "feral" Gorgon rumor before a desperate mother makes a choice that will silence the town forever.

---

## 1. THE CORE MYSTERY
**The Event:** Brother Demos is found petrified in the Temple Archives.
**The Truth:** Sister Photine (Head Healer) petrified him to prevent him from reporting her for using forbidden magic to save her secret daughter, Melaina.
**The Twist:** Demos was not attacking; he was trying to "save" Photine from her own exhaustion. The "Monster" is maternal love in a scarcity trap.

## 2. CHARACTERS & ROLES

### The Protagonist (The Sleuth)
**Cornelius** (Dragon Librarian)
*   **Wound:** Believes in "Biological Determinism" – that Gorgons are inherently dangerous ("It's in the venom"). He must learn that nurture overrides nature.
*   **Role:** The Skeptic who becomes the Advocate.
*   **Internal Goal:** To protect his books (Subplot: Book Sale).
*   **External Goal:** To solve the "Gorgon Problem" before the town burns down the Enclave.

### The Sidekick (The Heart)
**Zephyr "Zeph" Taraki** (Human Intern)

*   **Dynamic:** Pulls Cornelius away from cold logic toward empathy.

### The Anchor
**Imelda Kassiani** (Elf Head Librarian)
*   **Role:** The Pressure. She forces Cornelius to engage with the Book Sale, grounding the high magic stakes in mundane reality.
