RDL_VERSION: 1.0
SOURCE: Normalized from `braindump` (book_2_rdl, npe_analysis_conflict)

CANON FACTS
(Explicit statements that must not change later)
- **The Event:** Brother Demos is found petrified in the Temple Archives (Ch 2).
- **The Mechanic:** Petrification becomes permanent after exactly 72 hours.
- **The Killer:** Sister Photine (Head Healer).
- **The Motive:** Protective Intervention. Photine petrified Demos to stop him from reporting her use of forbidden magic to save her daughter, Melaina.
- **The Twist:** Melaina is Photine's secret daughter.
- **The Midpoint:** Melaina is found petrified (Ch 10). This is a "False Flag" by Photine to hide her and pause the disease.
- **The Ending:** Photine attempts to ship Melaina to the Capital. Cornelius confronts her at the docks. Demos is saved.

SOFT PREFERENCES
(Strong author intent, flexible if needed)
- **Subplot:** "The Great Book Cull." Cornelius must sell books to raise money, mirroring the theme of sacrifice.
- **Tone:** "Cozy Mystery" but with high emotional stakes ("Triage").
- **Ending Vibe:** Redemption. Photine is not a villain; she is a mother in a desperate corner.

OPEN QUESTIONS / AMBIGUITIES
(Unresolved, contradictory, or missing elements)
- **Exact Magic System:** How specifically does the "Life Force" drain work? (Assumed: It physically exhausts Photine).
- **Melaina's Condition:** "Medusa's Weep" (Degenerative Gaze). Is it contagious? (Assumed: No, genetic/curse).

BOOK-LEVEL DATA
- **Genre:** Cozy Mystery / Fantasy.
- **Tone / emotional register:** Warm community vs. Cold desperation.
- **Central tension:** Efficiency (Demos) vs. Love (Photine) in a Scarcity Field.
- **Stakes:** Demos's life (External) vs. Photine's Soul/Family (Emotional).
- **Ending intention:** Synthesis. The community steps up to help Melaina legally, proving Demos's bureaucratic fear wrong.
