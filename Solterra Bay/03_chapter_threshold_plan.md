# STRUCTURAL STORY PLAN

## STRUCTURE OVERVIEW
- **Preferred Structure:** 4-Act Cozy Mystery Grid (20 Chapters)
- **Justification:** Specified by **NPE Module: Cozy Mystery v1.2**. The "Fishbowl" community physics and "Social Lethality" constraints require a rigid investigation-to-revelation loop that mirrors the module's 20-chapter beat sheet.
- **Expected Chapter Count:** 20 Chapters (Strict Adherence to Module Grid)

## NARRATIVE PHASES

### PHASE 1: THE DISRUPTION (Ch 1-5)
- **Primary Function:** Destabilization & Establishment.
- **Dominant Axes:** Internal Axis (Cornelius's routine disturbed), External Axis (Introduction of Chaos/The Feast).
- **Entropy Range:** Low (1) -> Medium (4).
- **Major Decision:** Cornelius chooses to investigate "off the books" rather than trust the Watch (Ch 5).

### PHASE 2: THE FALSE TRAIL (Ch 6-10)
- **Primary Function:** Escalation & Misdirection.
- **Dominant Axes:** Relationship Axis (Cornelius vs. Theo, Cornelius vs. Suspects).
- **Entropy Range:** Medium (4) -> High (6).
- **Major Decision:** Cornelius commits fully to the "Petros Theory," ignoring contradictions (Confirmation Bias).
- **Threshold:** The Midpoint Collapse (Ch 10) - The theory fails.

### PHASE 3: THE CRUNCH (Ch 11-15)
- **Primary Function:** Re-orientation & Urgency.
- **Dominant Axes:** Temporal Axis (The Feast Ending), Internal Axis (Self-Doubt).
- **Entropy Range:** High (6) -> Critical (8).
- **Major Decision:** Cornelius accepts help/chaos (Zeph/Imelda) to solve the puzzle, abandoning isolation.

### PHASE 4: THE RESTORATION (Ch 16-20)
- **Primary Function:** Resolution & Synthesis.
- **Dominant Axes:** All Axes Converge (Restoration of Order).
- **Entropy Range:** Critical (8) -> Stable (2).
- **Major Decision:** Cornelius confronts the killer (Alexandros) using intellect/senses rather than force.

## THRESHOLD MAP

| Threshold | Type | Axis | Pressure | Placement | Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The Body Drop** | Collapse | External | The Murder of Elias | Ch 2 (Early) | Routine destroyed. Investigation begins. |
| **The First Threshold** | Commitment | Internal | Theo's Incompetence | Ch 5 (End Act 1) | Cornelius crosses from Observer to Participant. |
| **The Midpoint Reversal** | Revelation | Relationship | Petros's Alibi/Attack | Ch 10 (Mid) | "Perfect Theory" destroyed. Cornelius is lost. |
| **The Plot Point** | Synthesis | Information | The Letters' Content | Ch 15 (Late Act 3) | Motive shifts from Greed to Love/Pride. |
| **The Showdown** | Confrontation | External | Killer's Desperation | Ch 18 (Climax) | Killer neutralized. Truth exposed. |

## SUBPLOT ARCHITECTURE
- **Primary Subplot:** **Mirror Subplot** (Zeph's Development).
- **Conflict:** Zeph wants to be useful/respected; Cornelius treats him as a liability.
- **Arc:**
    - *Setup (Ch 1-4):* Zeph tries to help, makes noise, annoys Cornelius.
    - *Rising (Ch 5-11):* Zeph finds a clue Cornelius misses (Street smarts). Cornelius dismisses it.
    - *Crisis (Ch 12-14):* Cornelius snaps at Zeph; Zeph retreats or is endangered.
    - *Resolution (Ch 17-19):* Zeph's unique skill (Lamassu/Action) saves the moment or key evidence. Partners established.
- **Valley Chapters:** Ch 4, Ch 7, Ch 12, Ch 17.

## AXIS PROGRESSION PLAN
- **Internal Axis (Cornelius):** +2 (Stable/Stagnant) -> -4 (Doubt/Chaos) -> +3 (Dynamic Stability).
- **Relationship Axis (Zeph):** -3 (Friction) -> -5 (Conflict) -> +5 (Partnership).
- **Relationship Axis (Theo):** -2 (Rivalry) -> +2 (Mutual Respect).
- **External Axis (Community):** +1 (Feast Anticipation) -> -6 (Murder Fear) -> +8 (Feast Celebration).

## CHARACTER DECISION ARC (Cornelius)
1.  **Ch 5 Decision:** To investigate the *theft* primarily (ignoring the murder's social weight).
    *   *Cost:* Friction with Theo. Risk of hubris.
2.  **Ch 10 Decision:** To admit he was wrong about Petros.
    *   *Cost:* Pride. Intellectual vulnerability.
3.  **Ch 18 Decision:** To confront Alexandros alone/with Zeph rather than wait for the Watch.
    *   *Cost:* Physical danger (mild).
    *   *Alternative:* Let Theo handle it (likely killer escapes).

## GENRE-SPECIFIC STRUCTURAL CONSTRAINTS
- **Gossip Network:** Information travels instantly. No "finding out later" if it's public.
- **Social Lethality:** The confrontation cannot end in blood; it must end in *shame* or *arrest*.
- **The Feast Timer:** The investigation is bound by the days of the Feast. (Start: Day 1. End: Day 3/4).
